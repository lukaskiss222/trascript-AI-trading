Gary?\nGary Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President: Thank you and welcome, everyone. 2005 was certainly an outstanding year for PortalPlayer. On the financial side, we grew our annual revenue from $93 million in 2004, to $225 million in 2005. We also increased our profitability significantly year-over-year, and have impressive shipment activities throughout the entire quarter, including the last three weeks, which we recognize as deferred revenue. We are very proud of these results and believe that there's significant opportunity for growth in our current market of personal media players. And that we also have many opportunities ahead of us to leverage our technology to other fast-growing portable multimedia markets. We are really looking forward to the future. To help support this growth in 2005, we organized the business into three product divisions: Each focusing on a different market opportunity, personal media players, personal media displays, and personal wireless entertainment. In the personal media space, we achieved very impressive results this year. We introduced innovative new technologies, such as our PP 5022 family which tripled the battery life of media players and features our MPEG 4 and motion JPEG capabilities, and our 5024, which is our first device to integrate the media processor along with the audio power management and battery charging features in a single package. In September the iPod Nano, the first Flash-based media player using our technology was introduced into the market with great success. As a result, we extended our leadership position in the personal media player market to include Flash and hard drive-based storage. We also worked very aggressively on new technologies in 2005, we can't share details of all the projects we are focusing on just yet, but one result of our hard work was the successful launch at CES of our new PortalPlayer Preface technology. The implementation of which, garnered much attention and media attention during the show. We believe the new technology will expand into a major market segment, personal media displays, a new, exciting feature for notebook computers in 2006 and beyond. We'll talk more about that market in a few minutes. In addition to working on these new opportunities, we are also looking at ways we can incorporate wireless connectivity into new multimedia devices. We were proud to see the Sirius Satellite Radio, the first wireless customer shipping the revolutionary Sirius S50, a CES Innovation 2006 Award honoree in the portable audio category. In addition, our newly created personal wireless entertainment division has been working very hard on next generation wireless technologies. In a few minutes I will go into more detail on each of these initiatives but first I will turn the all over to Olav would will take you through the details of our fourth quarter and year-end financials.\nOlav Carlsen, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Gary and welcome, everyone. This fourth quarter of '05 was again another record quarter in many ways. We proud to announce that revenue was a record $78.2 million which is a 75% increase from the $44.7 million in the same period a year ago. And 35% higher than the revenue of $57.9 million we recorded in the third quarter of 2005. This is above our guidance range of 65 to $75 million due to the fact that we met stronger than expected demand, especially in the second half of the quarter. As Gary mentioned earlier, we had a very high level of shipping activity throughout the entire quarter. Our Q1 guidance of $70 to $80 million reflects the strong late quarter activity, as well as some expected seasonal decline for Q1, but less of a decline that you would expect after a very strong holiday quarter. Revenue from our largest customer represented about 95% of our total revenue, as market share shifted again in favor of this customer's very popular new model, which features innovative form factors and revolutionary capabilities. Having said that, in Q4, revenue from our other customers increased to about $3.9 million, and we're certainly are very proud about our new design wins at Sirius Satellite Radio, Phillips and SanDisk and more about this in a few moments. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 46.2% continued to be above our operating target margin of 41 to 44%, and I want to remind everyone again, that our financial forecast is based on a 41 to 44% growth margin range. Net income for the fourth quarter was $23.8 million, compared with a net income of $10.5 million in the same period a year ago. This fourth quarter 2005 net income resulted in an income of $0.92 per diluted share, based on $25.8 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a net income of $0.50 per diluted share based on approximately $21.1 million weighted average shares outstanding in the same quarter a year ago. The significant difference in share count between these two quarters is, of course, due to the fact that we went public in the middle of the fourth quarter a year ago, and the newly issued IPO shares were partially included in last Q4's share count, using the required weighted average method. Net income in the third quarter of 2005 was $10.3 million or $0.40 per diluted share, based on 25.5 million weighted average shares. In terms of taxes, we saw a one-time benefit this quarter, which impacted our results by $8.6 million or $0.33 per diluted share. Based on our recent strong financial performance in our financial forecast, we evaluated our deferred tax asset position and adjusted our valuation allowances accordingly. In doing this, we anticipated in the fourth quarter the favorable effect of some remaining tax NOLs. Now that we have used in 2005 most of the favorable effects from our pre-IPO losses, our effective tax rate for Q1 is expected to be at 35%, which is about the same as we had predicted in the past. When comparing year-over-year results in the future, it will be important to keep the difference in tax rates between '05 and 2006 in mind. Now, excluding stock-based compensation charges of $664,000, and the one-time tax benefit non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of '05 was $15.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share. This, compared with a non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of '04, of approximately $11.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of '05 was $11 million or $0.43 per diluted share. We provided the detailed reconciliation between GAAP numbers and the non-GAAP numbers, which detailed the stock compensation charges for each quarter, as well as the one-time tax adjustment. Now here's some other details on this quarter's P&L. In Q4, our ASPs and costs were in line with our expectations, since we began shipping our 5022 family about a year ago, ASPs for the SKU have decreased by 20% which is the low end of our financial forecast, of an ASP decline of 20 to 25% on individual SKU basis. Operating expenses were about $18.8 million for R&D, and SG&A in the fourth quarter, $1.8 million above our guidance, and as we experienced strong revenue growth, we increased our spending level accordingly, with our financial operating model in mind and so operating expenses again, like in previous quarters came in at our target level of about 24% of our revenues. $12.7million of this, or 16.3% of our revenue was allocated to our R&D activities as we continue to successfully accelerate some of our important R&D milestones. We were able, again, to attract many strategically important new employees, mostly in engineering areas here in the U.S. and in India. Going forward, in Q1, we expect to continue to manage our R&D spending to about 17% of our revenues, or about $13 million. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $6 million, which is a $2 million increase from the previous quarter, and is within our long-term operating model. This increase is mostly driven by additional costs associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and one-time expenses related to the filing of our S-1 in October of 2005. In Q1 we expect SG&A to remain within our long-term operating model n of about 7% of revenue, or about $5.2 million, $800,000 below our Q4 spending level. Our stock-based compensation charge of $664,000 included, as always, elements of amortization of deferred compensation, some variable charges, and a charge for amortizing the expense of restricted share grants that we began issuing in 2005. Going forward, we will record stock-based compensation in accordance with FAS 123-R, and will find the elements of these charges in the gross margin, and R&D and SG&A operating expenses, as well as the benefit from these expenses in our tax provision. For Q1, we expect our total compensation charge under FAS 123R to be about $2.4 million or about $1.8 million net of certain tax effects. Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at December 31st was $7.2 million, most of which is finished goods. This represents 10 to 11 days of inventory, once again, below our targeted goal of 30 days, reflecting the very strong activity level we saw at the end of the quarter. And accordingly, I will defer to income position, which represents the gross margin for shipments in the last three weeks of the quarter, was again at a very high level of $10.9 million. Head count at the end of the quarter was about 284, during the fourth quarter we added 34 very talented employees to our ranks, most of them in R&D. For the full year, we added a total of 103 new employees. As in previous quarters approximately 80% of our overall head count was focused on our current or strategic R&D activities and, again, about half of our overall head count was based in Hyderabad, in India. And now turning briefly from the fourth quarter to fiscal 2005 results, net revenue for fiscal 2005 was $225.2 million, up 143% from the $92.6 million in revenue for fiscal 2004. Net income for the year was $48.2 million or an income of $1.90 per diluted share based on 25.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares with a net income of $10.4 million, or $0.57 per diluted share based on about 18.1 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2004. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2005 was $41.8 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, which excludes the fourth quarter tax benefit, and non-cash compensation charges. This compared with a non-GAAP net income of $16.2 million, or $0.89 per diluted share in fiscal 2004, excluding non-cash compensation charges. And before I turn the call back over to Gary, let me summarize our guidance for the first quarter. Revenue is expected to come in between 70 and $80 million, total OpEx before stock charges is expected to be about 24% of revenue or about $18.2 million, stock-based compensation charges are expected to come in at $1.8 million, net of tax, GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be between $0.28 and $0.38 based on approximately 26.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, and excluding the net effect of our stock compensation charges, non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be between $0.35 and $0.45. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Gary for his comments. Gary?\nGary Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President: Thank you, Olav. Thank you. All around another great quarter, and a great year for PortalPlayer, Financially, operationally, and technically. I would like to thank the entire PortalPlayer team here in the U.S., in India, Taiwan, Korea and Japan for continuing to execute impeccably on business plan, follow our road map and in supporting our world-class customers. As I mentioned earlier, we organized the business into three product divisions last year focusing on personal media players, personal media displays and personal wireless entertainment. First, let's talk about our personal media player division. In the fourth quarter, we focused a lot of our attention on our operational execution. Supporting our customers as they significantly ramp their newly introduced products in the holiday season and getting new customers ready to introduce their products. Our largest customer had an excellent quarter, as for other customers, we recently announced that our technology is in the new SanDisk sensor, E200 series of mp3 players and the Phillips Go Gear HDD 6330 and 1630 personal media players. SanDisk E200 series, which features music playback, photo and video capabilities, is the first media player to use our 5024 device, and it comes in two, four and six gigabyte Flash models. SanDisk just introduced these players at CES few weeks ago and they already received rave reviews. The Phillips go models offer customers access to music, photos, FM radio, and voice recordings with an intuitive sensory touch pad and are available in 30 gig and 6 gigabytes HDD models. Phillips is one of the world's most recognizable customer brands and we are proud to be working again with them on these new personal media players. These new models, together with Apple's iPod, and iPod Nano, are examples of products in which we call, in what we call the feature rich segment of the personal media player market. Products in this feature rich segment include color displays, sophisticated features such as photo, video and gaming capabilities, in addition to playing music and large storage capabilities. In the future, we believe that this feature rich segment of the personal media player market will see very strong growth rates. We estimate that this portion of the market will almost double from about 35 million units in 2005, to about 64 million units in 2006. We intend to continue to be the leader in this segment. In contrast to the feature rich segment, personal media players that have no display or simple or single or double line displays, limited storage capacity, and only play music, we call the value portion of the market. These products are typically characterized by little opportunity for product differentiation, and low barriers to entry. We want to lead in the space where features, functionality and innovation are key. We believe that there are several significant drivers that are going to fuel demand for higher capacity media players, with additional functionality. Including the availability of video content, satellite radio services, PBR capabilities, subscription services, podcasts and wireless connectivity. Now let's talk about our personal media display division. This new product division leverages our current leadership in the personal media player market into other markets That can benefit from low power multimedia displays. The first new market addressed by this division is the secondary displays for notebook computers. These displays, an anticipated new feature in notebooks will be located on the outsides of the lid of the notebook, and allow the consumers to access key data, application, music, photos, and video content without having to turn on and boot up the notebook. In order to enable the best customer experience for this new feature, it should be tightly integrated with the operating system and applications on the notebook. With this in mind the personal media display division has been working very closely with Microsoft, to enable this capability in Microsoft's slide show technology, which is part of the Microsoft Vista operating system. We recently launched our solutions to in market under the name Preface and in a book, the preface is the first thing you read and from this case the Preface-enabled display is the first thing you will look at on your notebook. In addition to eliminating the need to boot the computer to access the notebook content, a process that can take between two and four minutes, the low-powered nature of the Preface technology platform can enable up to 500 hours of music playback on the notebook. The low powered capabilities of the Preface platform also enabled access to certain notebook content for tens of hours, even if the battery is depleted to the point where the notebook can no longer boot up. Initially notebooks that incorporate this technology will have access to data such as music, picture slide shows, Outlook calendar, e-mail, contact information, alarms, clocks, battery meters, and so forth. In addition, Microsoft is making this an open platform so third-party developers will be able to write their own applications, known as gadgets, allowing users access to many kinds of data stored on the notebook. In addition to Microsoft, we have also been working with partners such as Altura, Authentec, and Symantec to offer a variety of interfaces for these personal media displays. According to Gartner, notebooks are the fastest growing segment in the PC market and we believe that manufacturers are looking for ways to differentiate their products. The PortalPlayer Preface technology enables visible differentiation to the design and the use of notebooks, which really have not changed since they were first introduced in the 1990s. We expect notebooks and secondary displays using Windows Vista to begin shipping in the second half of 2006. This year, we believe that total available market for this technology could be as high as 6 million units, growing to 16 million units next year and about 48 million units or almost half of the entire notebook market by 2008. Our targeted customers to Preface will be the top 10 OEM and ODM notebook manufacturers. In fact at CES we showed prototype designs from Quanta, and Asustec, which together make up a substantial portion of entire notebook market. Our sales and promotion efforts for the preface platform were kicked off earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where we were able to show the Preface technology to a wide variety of press, analysts and potential notebook OEM customers. The response from the wide ranging audience was enthusiastic interest in the technology, and interest for the notebook OEMs to incorporate the technology in the 2006 and the 2007 models. And also an energetic display of the preface technology Walt Mossberg on CNBC. We are very excited about this market and the opportunity gives us in leveraging our existing technology into an entirely new space, targeting a new customer base. Revenue from this new major market could potentially reach 10% of our overall revenue in 2006. Our personal wireless entertainment product division has also been hard at work, behind the scenes here at PortalPlayer. The group is focused both on the technology aspects of wireless, as well as understanding the ecosystem required to deliver compelling user experience on wirelessly connected devices. In addition, they are exploring opportunities to address the shortcomings in battery life and usability seen in many of the wireless devices already in the market today. Looking forward into 2006, we will continue efforts in the wireless space, by working with strategic customers, wireless technology partners, as well as considerating strategic wireless acquisitions as they make sense. In summary, we are extremely pleased with our accomplishment in 2005, and believe that 2006 will be even more exciting. We believe that the feature rich segment of the personal media player market could almost double year-over-year in 2006, offering us a great opportunity for continued growth in our core market. With the expected emergence of the personal media display market in the latter half of the year, this will allow us to further increase the market opportunities available to us, and diversify our customer and revenue base as well. We continue to invest in wireless technology, as we believe that this wireless connectivity will become an integral part of the overall consumer electronics landscape. We are now happy to open up the call to take your questions about our business. I want to remind everyone that it is our policy not to comment on specific customer products or road map. Operator, we are ready for questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator:\nOperator Instructions:\nQ - Randy Abrams: Yes, Thanks a lot. I wanted to start off, you mentioned the Phillips and SanDisk products and maybe talk about your outlook for diversification over the next couple of quarters, even more in the media division, as three customers ramp up.\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, as you know, Randy, CES is a very busy time for us, for us to bring new designs and to bring new life to our potential customers. The designs that analysts and other folks saw at CES are a good preview for the first half, but I as I said, the ones we've announced so far are focused on the Phillips and SanDisk devices. The SanDisk device, I think brings some new innovations to the market, the capacity of the device is very nice, the user interface, but beyond, beyond the SanDisk and Phillips devices we will not disclose new customer wins until our customers announce them.\nQ - Randy Abrams: Okay. And Olav, I want to see if you could clarify, the ASP a unit year-over-year trends. I think you mentioned that 20%, was that a total company ASP for year-over-year?\nA - Olav Carlsen: Well, it almost turned into total company because we shipped, most of our product we shipped basically, especially in the last three quarters of the year were the 5022 and so I only referenced the ASP decline for the 5022, which was a 20% year-over-year decline.\nQ - Randy Abrams: Okay. And do you have the total year-over-year?\nA - Olav Carlsen: The total year-over-year for the portfolio, is that what you are asking?\nQ - Randy Abrams: Yes.\nA - Olav Carlsen: It's below that. It's between 15 and 20%.\nQ - Randy Abrams: Okay. And then turning over to Preface, could you talk about, I think you mentioned that displays is the first application. Maybe talk about some of the other applications where this technology starts to make sense.\nA - Gary Johnson: Yes, the, the other applications again reinvolvele around multimedia displays and what Mossberg got excited about on CNBC, we had example prototypes at CES that showed this in intelligent remote controls, the ability to have rich display with lots of content on the remote controls, also, for example, front panels, for example, in media centers as media center PCs become more intelligent, you could well see a more intelligent user interface and panel for that market. Longer term, this type of application, I can see this moving to many markets, including automotive, but I would say, beyond notebooks, remote controls and media center PCs are that we have already demonstrated at CES.\nQ - Randy Abrams: Okay. And maybe one final question, just on the gross margin. Maybe talk about the trends that drove the upside in gross margins and then as you move into the notebook application, is there any prospect with that mix shift that it will carry a higher margin?\nA - Olav Carlsen: So the second part of your question, I don't believe that there's a shift. I think we feel very comfortable in the 41 to 44% target model that we are operating in longer term. So I see with the diversification of our business in the second half of the year, I don't see that margin model change. The, the first part of your question was about the trends or the uptrend to the 46, or about 46% gross margin in Q4, again, I need to remind you, our long-term model is 41 to 44%. That's our target model. If because of customer mix, or cost developments specifically the development on the cost side, if we can have a specific quarter or even two quarters we are happy about that.\nQ - Randy Abrams: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\nQ - Peter Kirzres: Hi, this is Peter Kirzres (ph) with Glen Yeung. I wanted to ask going forward into the first quarter, your guidance is better than normal, seasonal decline. If we get a feel for how much of that would be coming from new customers, versus how much of that is coming from your existing customers, or, I guess your largest customer. And also if there's any benefit in pricing, as well.\nA - Olav Carlsen: So, Peter we don't break out our revenue guidance by customer, it's a matter of policy. We do give you data on past quarters but not in terms of guidance. We are very proud of the designs that are shipping from Phillips and Sirius and we are excited about SanDisk. Ultimately consumers will decide how much they like the products. They are certainly cool products out there. It's too early to break it up at this time. Can you remind me of the second part of your question?\nQ - Peter Kirzres: That actually takes care of it. But I will ask you this then, on a separate subject, for wireless, as you are working through your wireless division, have you zeroed in or do you have any more clarity on what type of assets you might need to take in to, as you bring the products to market? Or before you bring products to market?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, yes, we have honed in on the type of assets but they are not for discussion at this point. The technologies that obviously interest us most are technologies that can really add to our portfolio of low power technologies. When we look at wireless, in terms of a hand held device, we really want to focus around applications that will start to push you both in multimedia aspect and the low power aspects. So, we could use acquisitions as part of the methodology to acquire technology, and expertise there but we also, as you indicated have had a very active in internal development now during 2005. The short answer is it's too early to tip our hat, but we are narrowing in on what we think will be very important capabilities on the next generation platforms.\nQ - Peter Kirzres: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jason Pflaum of Thomas Weisel Partners.\nQ - Jason Pflaum: Yes, good afternoon. Congratulations.\nA - Olav Carlsen: Thanks.\nQ - Jason Pflaum: Just to touch on the guidance, again, I guess looking at the deferred income line. It looks I can you have a third of your revenue guidance, I guess in the deferred income line heading into the quarter. What type of seasonality or linearity are you expecting in the quarter? Is it typically a back-end loaded quarter, maybe some color as far as that?\nA - Olav Carlsen: Are you suggesting that, are you asking whether the first quarter is a back end specifically or the fourth?\nQ - Jason Pflaum: The first quarter, I'm interested in.\nA - Olav Carlsen: I don't think that the first quarter is a back-end loaded quarter. Number one, our guidance reflects everything that we know at this time, and most current business inputs. And to your question on the deferred revenue, yes, we have extremely busy three weeks activity there in the last three weeks. It is right that as a central portion of the revenue that we guide to, is already in that deferred portion. So that we realize in the Q1, it's certainly, we have to do some math and I can help with you that, how much of the deferred revenue is already sold through our customers in the fourth quarter and how much of that is going to be sold through by our customers in the first quarter.\nQ - Jason Pflaum: All right. Okay. And then just again on the gross margin. I think your guidance, or you are implying that you would fall back within that 41 to 44% range in Q1. Can you talk about what the drivers of that would be, perhaps more pricing or maybe just a level of conservatism?\nA - Olav Carlsen: It's just a matter of consistency. This is our target model, 41 to 44. This is the model around which we model a very highly successful company of in financial terms so we would like to remind everyone about it. What could drive, the gross margin from 46 back to 44, 43, pricing and cost? And as new products will be introduced throughout the year, as costs, the manufacturers cost shed, it's easy to get a 2% change in your gross margin up and down, so we like to remind everyone about that target model of 41 to 44%.\nQ - Jason Pflaum: Okay. And then last question, just circling back on a missed opportunity. When you look into the design window, can you just talk generally about where you stand today as far as your interaction with customers? Have you locked in any design wins yet, just kind of talk about what gives you confidence in kind of your 10% revenue target by year end.\nA - Gary Johnson: Let me describe, let me set the landscape, first of all. As you know, a good deal of the features and the benefits come in lock stead with Vista. And so we, when we look, that clearly looks towards a policy and second half opportunity for us. The notebook OEMs and ODMs all have different cycles. There are some OEMs and ODMs, for example, that already have plastics and cases designed into the, you know the earlier '07 time period, but there are many others who have cycles throughout the year, and they are the ones that will be targeting as we look at the second half '06 opportunity. Again, we will be relying on the VISTA rollouts, but, again, by having the technology and having the technology demonstrated, frankly with two leaders at CES we believe the platform is stable, and it's now ready to be incorporated by the notebook OEMs and ODMs and we feel very encouraged by the feedback we are getting.\nQ - Jason Pflaum: Okay. Very well. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: Hello. Nice job on the quarter, guys.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thanks.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: You reorganized now into three divisions. I'm just kind of wondering looking forward maybe in '07, I mean is this something you think over time you start to report revenue by division, just to give us a flavor as to what was the traditional personal media player, what was Preface or personal media displays and PWE on a good forward basis? Again that might not make sense until later this year. Do you envision going in that direction when talking about revenues.\nA - Gary Johnson: We have not made that decision yet. It's sort of premature but, you know, we'll certainly take input in that makes sense, we'll certainly look at that That but we have made no decisions on that at this point.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: And then following up on Jason's question about the timing of the launch. It seems the Computex trade show in early June is one big trade show where you see a lot of the second half systems. Would you think that you have at least prototype systems or your customers might have prototype systems on the show floor sort of for display, in that time frame?\nA - Gary Johnson: I don't want to be that specific, frankly, in tying down sort of future design wins, that level of granularity. You are absolutely right, Computex is an important time of the year, and we, frankly, are, from an investment point of view, investing quite significant resources now in our Taiwan office in terms of development expertise. So we are very focused on that. As you pointed out, that would be, an important time of year for us but I don't want to go any further, in preannouncing customer design wins. As you know, the style base, we do that for all of our customers and we let our customers announce first and then generally we announce post their announcements. You are absolutely right, Computex will be a busy time.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: Okay. Maybe one for Olav, I know you haven't introduced, formally introduced the new silicon platform, as you look at, you talked about a 20 to 25% sort of per SKU price decline, what do you have on the road map in terms of process technology shrinks, either down to say, 0.11 or 90-nanometer is that something that we can expect to help you further reduce costs either on existing platforms or new platforms?\nA - Olav Carlsen: There's nothing that we can talk about today in terms of reducing it to 90-nanometer or anything. I think it's pretty logical that over time, you will look at this, we are an engineering and fab company so we have people look at this all the time and it's not just for not starting today only. So will it help us on costs? Absolutely. These reductions when you get over the first hump, maybe the first quarter or two and as you ram in significant production, yes, you should see a benefit at a time when you move from 0.13 to 90 nanometer, as we have experienced when we moved from 0.18 to 0.13. Having said all of this, you know, we haven't made any announcements at this time. We want to remind you of that.\nA - Gary Johnson: I want to add a little color of that. A good part of our business, it's still one where innovation counts and it's the speed of innovation and bringing out new product cycles as we are doing and adding new features. In general as you said, as you implied you can have the cost reduction cycles. At the moment this market is adding features at such a rate that we are generally focusing much more on the next cycle of innovation, that necessarily focusing on a cost reduction path. We have lots of new technology to integrate in.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: It's likely having some type of process technology shrink, but, you haven't announced the details yet. Just last question on the personal wireless entertainment, is the Sirius design win is that grouped into that division, or is that still part of the traditional PNP business?\nA - Gary Johnson: That really came out of the 2005 efforts, the formation of this business unit came as we transitioned from '05 to '06 and as you said, it could be viewed in sort of either case. What was probably and frankly more important than where it all sits in the business is the learnings we got in being an applications processor, certainly is applicable to that division's work and we've got some, again that with other significant efforts going on is building, we think, some good internal mention on our own technology capability.\nQ - Quinn Bolton: Great, thanks again, guys.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adam Benjamin with Jefferies & Company.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: Thanks, guys. Great quarter.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thanks.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: With respect to the gross margin, your guidance does seem to indicate or imply about 41% or so coming down from the 46% range. Can you give us any view, is that a shift due to maybe from the 5022 to the 5024?\nA - Gary Johnson: There's some, can you hear me all right, Adam? There's some disturbance there on the audio here.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: Yeah, I can hear you.\nA - Olav Carlsen: Okay. Don't take what I said as a guidance. For any particular part. I would just like to remind you that what our long-term model is and I, we do not guide to the next quarter's margin. So having said that I mean, is there then another question that is, anything else that you,\nQ - Adam Benjamin: Well, I guess what I was trying to get at is it does appear as Q1 comes down to the bottom end of that 41 to 44% range, is that something we can expect to come back up in Q2?\nA - Olav Carlsen: So as I haven't guided to the bottom range or the upper range, you know I can't answer your question, really, and bringing, just taking, I constantly remind everyone of the 41 to 44, this is not new. I have done this in the past fourth quarter. We present the 41 to 44% gross margin model everywhere and so it hasn't changed. This is not new. This is consistent with the past. Don't take that as a specific guidance for the first quarter.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: Back to wireless connectivity I know you have been beating around the bush on this. People have been talking about PNPs having wireless LAN and Bluetooth built in. Can you give us some better view as to what that group could look at?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, one way of giving it some color on that is actually CES where you have a technology demonstration there, where, for example, we were starting to point towards the capabilities, for example, of Wi-Fi. That is now pervasive enough that you've got hot spots. You have home networks. You have office networks. You've got streaming. But Wi-Fi is prevalent. That certainly could be a useful addition to a pnp capability. In the area of Bluetooth, we think that's more likely to be signed, for example to work on wireless headsets and frankly, we demonstrated that a year before last at CES So you are right, in that the wireless technologies typically take longer to rollout. They have to have an infrastructure in place. You have to really generate, good insertability, but Wi-Fi, for one, does look an attractive solution, now that we have, you know, access points everywhere, you have got low-cost o r no-cost services. So we feel quite bullish on Wi-Fi.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: One last question. With respect to the cell phone market, there's, there has been some debate as to whether the MP3 capability will be run off the base then or there will be a multimedia processor and that would put you in direct competition against a TIs, or others. How are you seeing that market and is that a market you can expect to play in, in maybe late '06 or if not '07/08?\nA - Gary Johnson: You are right, there's various architectures being proposed and emerging in the cell phone space. The simple low cost coprocessor to give you sort of simple polyphonic tones and MP3 playback have gone as the first generation of phones in that they haven't really got, they haven't got great user acceptance. They are in the phones but that simple co-processor is not one that's particularly attractive to us. But moving forward, though as you describe the co-processor has proved to be a popular business model for adding new multimedia features to the phone. And so that clearly would offer interest to us as we look at focusing really on the features and the battery life and performance as differentiation. So that the co-processor model has proved itself to be popular and that could be a vehicle we could use to bring, you know, high quality, low power multimedia type features to that type of market.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: Are you currently seeing design activity there?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, as we talk about for all of our product lines, we won't be disclosing design wins or customer wins ahead of time. We have been very active with work in that space now for a period of time, but these cycles , typically the wireless space, are more extended than you would have in a traditional market, solidification cycles, working with these platforms, do take longer. So there's nothing that we would announce at this time.\nQ - Adam Benjamin: All right, great. Thanks a lot.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thank you.\nA - Olav Carlsen: Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research.\nQ - Daniel Ernst: Yes, good evening. Thank you for taking the call. A couple, if I might. First, Olav your R&D spending, it fell a bit below your 17% target. So will your spending or your hiring in the quarter allow you to catch up to your target during the, during the first quarter or into the second? And then on your inventory level, being at 10 to 11 days, did you expect to be able to get into your target range over the course of the first quarter as well? And then just last question, on Java ME can you talk about that what that does to margins of a given platform, are you able to pass through the royalty of software costs on top of platform per unit, or do you actually get a little bit of upside on margin on Java and the ME enabled platforms?\nA - Olav Carlsen: All right, the answer to the first two, it's simple, it's both yes. So even though R&D was below the 17%, we have increased it significantly as you see quarter over quarter and as revenue increased, even faster, we're below the 17%, but slightly, right, 16.3%. We are targeting and we keep targeting that is building to our very fleflible spending model of 17% R&D and the guidance that we have given is very clearly We are again hiring about $13 million of R&D for the first quarter. We will be hiring. We will be successful as we were in the last quarter. I have no doubt that we can attract very talented engineers to our group, with our new divisions. We have a lot of, you know with have a lot to sell here to these people. They are very interested in what we are doing. I have no doubt that we can be a successful R&D spending company in Q1, within the target model. Inventory, 10 to 11 days that's kind of like what you have seen in the past. And, you know, when you calculate the inventory days you get a balance sheet snapshot. You don't see what we have during a quarter and when we have the high level of activity that certainly looks at the balance sheet. With doe have a 30-day goal. I would like to remind you, it's not just us holding inventory we have a powerful supply chain with our intermediaries. It is very easy for us to pull inventory out of the supply chain. We don't have to have it on the balance sheet. I'm very happy with the 10 to 11 days. I would like to see a little more inventory, but a balance sheet snap, but balance sheet snapshot, during the quarter might be different things sometimes. So I have no concern about our inventory level whatsoever. I will pass it on to Gary on your Java question.\nA - Gary Johnson: Yeah, on the Java question, as with any of the new technologies that we are adding, for example, at CS, we were able to show the addition of things like gaming, the video, and of other advanced features. They generally offer us an opportunity, as you point out to do an upsale in terms of ASP price points. Not always the case but sometimes strategically we don't necessarily do that. For example in video, we purposefully have what we call a, one part of our strategy is what we call video-for-ree and C.S we showed MPEG 4 on our existing chip set and make video part of the main stream for that market for a zero uplift. But you're right in, general, when there's other licensed software we do aim to have an ASP uplift.\nQ - Daniel Ernst: Do you expect to be able to generate some wins on the Java enabled platform during the year?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, the, we wouldn't have been, we wouldn't have made that investment and shown it at C.S, if we thought it was a zero sum game. We have significant interest from different times of customers that are interested in that. Again, it's, it's preannounced design wins but it is an important technology and one that actually can be applied, you know across different segments of our product divisions, as you think about it. So we think Java is an important extension technology for us, as well as we'll hope we turn into additional business this year.\nQ - Daniel Ernst: Great. Thanks, Gary and thanks Olav. Look forward to seeing more of this.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Craig Berger with Wedbush Morgan.\nQ - Craig Berger: Good afternoon, gentlemen and nice job on the execution.\nA - Olav Carlsen: Thank you.\nQ - Craig Berger: A couple questions. One, on the, on your relationship with your manufacturing partner, are there any plans to change that? In the foreseeable future or do all things remain rosy on that front?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, the, I would say all things remain rosy. We enjoy I think very positive relationships, as you would expect in a growing business. I think the vector is clearly in the right direction for everyone as part of the bigger economy here. So in general, I think we're very happy with both intermediaries we used. So, no immediate changes on the horizon.\nQ - Craig Berger: Okay.\nA - Gary Johnson: And good relationships with all.\nQ - Craig Berger: Have any of your customers complained about margins stacking or driving costs down further or it's not an issue at this point?\nA - Gary Johnson: Our customers constantly complain about pricing, and it's part of their pricing negotiation discussion we typically have two or three times a year. Nothing that's out of the ordinary. Of course, customers find various reasons to complain about pricing, but as I said, we've had a very consistent 41 to 44% model that we've been working towards. We bring a great deal of value to our customers solutions, so, but, of course, customers find any reason to complain, but our 41 to 44% puts us in a good balance, and the right sweet spot we think with the value to our biggest customers.\nQ - Craig Berger: Okay. With respect to the depressive engagement, can you talk about the competitive situation there? Who else do you know of is gunning for those sockets and potentially, do you know if they are as far along in their software development efforts as you are or whether or not your head start was exclusive with Microsoft?\nA - Gary Johnson: We believe we have a very significant head start. We haven't seen other folks talking about this type of solution in the market. So we do, I think we do characterize it as having a significant lead in the market. Part of that, frankly, comes in developing this, working very closely with Microsoft, there was an enormous amount of work that went into this for the second half of '05. We do expect to see competitors emerge, but at the moment, from certainly the very strong response we are getting from the, the notebook OEM and ODMs, I think we have an opportunity to establish a real foothold here in the market as we go.\nQ - Craig Berger: Is there a market share in that market that you would be happy with?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, of course, I would like a very large market share there, but, no, we are not going to make a public prediction of market share for this type of segment. We have been very fortunate working with leaders in the personal media class space and we have advantage in personal media displays and we hope to turn that into a long term relationship. To your point, we are playing this for long term, we think that '06 will give us really good momentum, but we really have to build and really keep our eye focused on the potential market of 16 million and 48 million units in the subsequent years. So time will tell, but we have a fresh move to start.\nQ - Craig Berger: One more and then I will drop off. Can you give us maybe who are your top two competitors in that market segment?\nA - Gary Johnson: Again, they are not, there are no names that are being expressed to us in that segment as yet.\nQ - Craig Berger: Okay.\nA - Gary Johnson: Again,\nQ - Craig Berger: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Shawn Slayton with SG Cowen.\nQ - Shawn Slayton: Good afternoon. When does OpEx cease to become a fixed percentage of sales for PortalPlayer? And I ask this, you know, because of the universe of fab companies so much of the earnings growth is derived from leverage off ever operating expenses.\nA - Olav Carlsen: Well, not in the foreseeable future and when I say that, I don't plan to change the model over the next couple of quarters, but, yeah, you have a point. If at some point, this becomes a huge revenue company den aim I'm not pointing to this, I'm just theoretically discussing I'm pretty sure at some point in time, you will see the leverage and especially on our SG&A side, you will see some leverage, with 24% target model will not be 24 or 22 or something below. But I think it's too early to discuss at the time. We're fast ramping in not just one division anymore. We have like, two interesting divisions now. We are targeting business and customer diversification, which is very important for us, and for our investors, you, investors with, you know, the successful launch of our PMD division, the personal media division and the wireless is our next step. So we have, I think, you know, good incentive to keep spending at a certain level and limit it to that level so that you guys have an opportunity to look at our financials for the future and to model us for 2006. I give you the point that at some time later, develop to maybe look at that model again but not for the foreseeable future.\nQ - Shawn Slayton: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And for Gary, you know, considering your extensive experience within the MP3 player industry, can you help us understand, you know, the significance relative underperformance of higher capacity window-based MP3 players as compared to the obvious alternative? I mean this cam subpoena certainly a very large, camp is certainly a very large opportunity for PortalPlayer and when does it take off in your estimation?\nA - Olav Carlsen: Well, the, I'm not sure I have any particular insight other than it's obvious in the market. The present market leader is just firing on all cylinders across a broad range of strengths in both services and content and devices. They are doing everything right.\nQ - Shawn Slayton: So I, for the other camp, is it an asset or marketing dollars or features? What will get that other camp moving?\nA - Gary Johnson: I think to get the other camp moving, it is, there's going to have to be a maturity in the technology, the technology has progressed over the last two generations. That needs to be, I think, a shift maybe in the Tyne of business model in the way that the people want to enjoy content. The model from Microsoft, you know, starts to really focus in more on a subscription type of model, a more adaptable, purchase or view for 30 days or enjoy for 30 days model. And so, really, I think it may come down to, do people, well a segment of the population latch on to subscription services. And without that, you are right,-- the difference becomes very unclear.\nQ - Shawn Slayton: Okay. Thanks guys, I appreciate it.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Paraschac with Kaufman Brothers.\nQ - Jason Paraschac: Hopefully two quick questions. One on the Preface product, that it's based on the 5024 platform. Going forward if you try to diversify, should we expect, these other product verticals that you need to be also based on the same chip platform that you are using in your core market.\nA - Gary Johnson: Not necessarily. We took an opportunity for speed and also the actual factor that the display drove, display lid drove, which is a small physical size. 5024 was a perfect fit. But to your point in other verticals, we will develop, you know, specific leading edge solutions for those verticals, but, again, if we can leverage the technology and maintain the chip technology it's a great ROI for us. So the answer is that was probably an example of good adoption technology across the space, in general, as you know, we have previously discussed having three development teams and we certainly have the ability to develop specialized silicon for different market opportunities.\nQ - Jason Paraschac: Okay. And then you talked about the feature rich MP3 market in terms of the unit volumes. I'm curious if you looked, to see how that will evolve this year. How much of that market could be addressed with the capabilities of the 5022 product today?\nA - Gary Johnson: Certainly with the addition recently of the from CES, the capability of video, as you looked into '06, we think a lion's share of that market is available to that class of product. It really does address, you know, the audio, the photo, the video, and the gaming capabilities. So I think a lion's share of that market is developed for that class of product.\nQ - Jason Paraschac: And the video spec on the 5022 that you were showing, I mean it was a little reduced from what's out there in the market. But, you know, do you think that is enough at least this year to, you know, most of the market out there?\nA - Gary Johnson: Well, certainly the feedback that we got from our customers was not quite as negative as you first sort of posed it there? I didn't mean it to be negative.\nQ - Jason Paraschac: No, that's fine. The example on the key metric that everyone, I think was impressed with was the 30 frames per second MPEG 4 functionality on the smaller screen. That technology, i.e. video for free, will not be on the larger display devices but for the main stream devices where the cost of the display is paramount, we think that could be a very compelling solution and, again, it's hard to be free. Great. Great quarter, guys. Thanks.\nA - Gary Johnson: Thanks a lot. Well, operator.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answers sir. I would like to turn it back to you for closing remarks..\nGary Johnson, Chief Executive Officer, President: Thank you very much for joining us today. We plan to meet with investors on February 8th in San Francisco at the Thomas Weisel Partners technology conference. We look forward to seeing many of you there, and with that, we'll conclude this conference call. Thank you.\nOperator: Once again that does conclude today's conference.

I will now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Michael. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's fourth quarter conference call. Today we are pleased to report record revenue of 633.6 million, and net income of $0.53 per share for our fourth quarter. Year-over-year fourth quarter revenue grew at 12%, and net income grew 104%. For the fiscal year we achieved record revenue of 2.38 billion, an increased our net income 202% year-over-year. We also recorded our seventh consecutive year of profitability since going public in 1999. As we entered this year we had launched the GeForce 6 Series, nForce4 MCP, and SLLI with terrific market reception. Our objective during the year was to strengthen our technology leadership position of our GPU and MCP businesses, extend the reach of SLI with a broad range of compatible products, applications and games for enthusiasts, drive gross margin to historical levels, and build new products and market initiatives that will be the platform of our continued growth. Let me share with you some of highlights and achievements for the year. Our core business grew 26% year-over-year, and more than offset the $146 million decline from Xbox revenue from the prior year. The desktop and notebook segments of our GPU business grew more than 18% year-over-year, outgrowing the PC industry average. We entered the year with clear momentum, led by our top to bottom GeForce 6 family and SLI. With the launch of the new GeForce 7800 GTX and 7300 GS in the second half, we strengthened our position and continued to capture desktop GPU share. And the first half of fiscal 2006 was also important phase for our notebook GPU. With the GeForce 7 family delivering the best performance and performance per watt advantage, our notebook design win success for spring 2006 was the best in the Company's history. We're now beginning to recognize the revenue growth from that design win cycle. Our MPC revenue more than doubled from last year, and has surpassed the $100 million per quarter mark. The business is still accelerating. Our strategy is to create the number one brand of core logic for high-performance computing, then leverage our leadership position to cover every single market segment certified in any new processors. In the most recent Maximum PC Magazine nForce was named the best core logic for both AMD, as well as Intel platforms. The growth our Quadro Professional Solutions business is a reflection of the digital revolution sweeping nearly every industry, from industrial designed to industrial styling, to film, high-definition broadcast, medical image and many more, medical imaging and many more. For fiscal 2006 our professional business grew 40% year-over-year. The Quadro brand has become the benchmark of performance and compatibility for the professional industry. Our handheld GPUs are setting the bar for multimedia experiences that is possible on a handheld device. The confluence of broadband, high-density, flash storage and high-resolution displays is making it possible for us to deliver a spectacular multimedia experience on handheld devices. Our GoForce handheld GPUs are now shipping in the new Motorola 3G RAZR V3x and the new Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. The RAZR V3x won the best 3G handset 2006 award this week at the 3GSM conference. SLI has defined the enthusiast category, and is now a must have feature for gamers. SLI even has its own fan club with over 6,000 members around the world, who share their experiences building and using SLI systems. More than 3 million SLI motherboards and 9 million SLI GPUs have shipped to date. Design work of the RSX has been completed, and we have for some time the production silicon. The PlayStation 3 demonstration at CES 2006 were a preview of the awesome power of the platform and what consumers can expect this year. We announced our intent to acquire ULi Electronics, originally Acer Laboratories, one of the PC industry's most highly regarded core logic developers. The acquisition represents our ongoing investment in our platform strategies, platform solution strategy, and is expected to strengthen our sales marketing and customer engineering presence in Taiwan and China. Lastly, gross margins surpassed 40%, increasing 1,260 basis points from our low point only nine quarters ago. We made many fundamental investments and changes in our business, and by doing so have built a new financial model for the graphics industry to follow. We have now reset our gross margin target to the mid-40s. Let me also highlights some of our fourth quarter fiscal 2006 results. Desktop GPU segment share increased to 51%, according to Mercury Research fourth quarter 2005 PC graphics report. We started production of nForce 4 SLI SE and nForce 4 Ultra for the Intel platforms. This is our first discrete chipset targeted at mainstream Intel-based motherboards. NForce's quarterly revenue increased 83% year-over-year, and has achieved record revenue for six consecutive quarters. Dell and NVIDIA showcased the first-ever Quad SLI PC, the Dimension XPS Renegade at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, and earned the best the CES 2006 award for gaming. The Quadro workstation product line increased its revenue 42% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and again achieved record revenues. NVIDIA introduced three new notebook GPUs, the GeForce Go 7800, the GeForce Go 7600, and the GeForce Go 7400 with leading Tier 1 and system builders worldwide. NVIDIA announced that Quadro Professional Graphics will offer Adobe users direct GPU acceleration capabilities that dramatically increase application performance, and video editing workflow for Adobe Product Studio. As a member of the Adobe OpenHD Alliance, NVIDIA is working with Adobe in the industry to develop tools and technology that enhance the productivity of HD video creation. And finally this week at the 3GSM conference in Spain, we unveiled a GoForce 5500 handheld GPU, the industry's first handheld GPU to enable DVD quality video, full H.264 processing for fluid digital television, high fidelity surround sound, rapid multishot photography, and console-class 3D graphics. Phones based on the GoForce 5500 handheld GPU are expected to be available from key handset set manufactures before the 2006 holiday season. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. I will return to discuss our progress and outlook.\nMarvin Burkett, Chief Financial Officer: I would like to start with some comments about the P&L for the fourth quarter and then move onto the balance sheet. Finally, I will give an outlook for Q1. On the P&L revenue for the quarter was 633.6 million, which is up 8.6%, or $50 million from the third quarter, and up 12% from the prior year. The largest increase was in the MCT where sales grew 27% quarter over quarter. We also had increases in workstation and handheld products. Year-over-year MCPs sales were up 83%, which more than offset the lost Xbox revenue. Gross margins continued to increase, and in the quarter reached for 40.2%, which is the highest since Q3 of fiscal year 2000. Again, there was no single factor that led to this improvement. There was a broad range of process improvements, and we improved margins in several product areas. Year-over-year gross margins improved by 600 basis points. Operating expenses were 142.6 million, relatively flat with Q3 when you consider that Q3 included a settlement cost charge of 14.2 million. We got the benefit of the vacations and holidays that are usually taken in the fourth quarter, but we continued to hire. We added 143 employees in the fourth quarter, and our year ending headcount was 2,737. Depreciation and amortization was 23.8 million, as compared to 24.5 in Q3, and was 98 million for the year. Capital expenditures were 23.4 million in the quarter and $80 million for the year. The tax rate was 16% for the quarter and for the year. We repatriated approximately 420 million of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act, but the increased tax expense associated with this was offset by the taxes we had previously see provided on these foreign earnings. Also in the quarter we repurchased $50 million of stock at an average cost of $36.89. The net result was earnings of 98 million or $0.53 per share in the quarter and 303 million or $1.65 for the year on the balance sheet, cash jumped up to 950 million, as we had operating cash flow in the quarter of 236 million. In addition to the earnings and depreciation, we reduced accounts receivable by 34 million, and reduced inventory by 30 million. The accounts receivable was reduced by a combination of good collections and more linearity of our shipments during the quarter. DSO in the quarter was 45.7 days, down from 54.9 in the previous quarter. The inventory reduction was the result of significant reductions in older products, offset by an increase in new yet to be announced products. Days sales and inventory for the quarter was 61 days, down from 73 last quarter. Accounts Payable was flat quarter to quarter. On the outlook, the first quarter for the PC industry is usually slightly down from the fourth quarter. For us we believe this seasonal weakness will be more than offset by growth in MCP products and in our notebook GPU business. Also we had previously anticipated that Q1 would show a reduction in the non-recurring engineering associated with Sony. However, because of follow on contracts, we do not anticipate any reduction. We expect to complete the acquisition of ULi in the near future, and this may add as much as 10 million in revenue for the quarter. When you put all of this together, we expect revenue will increase 3 to 6% in the quarter. We continue to work on improving gross margins, and this work is far from complete. We believe we can continue to improve margins in the first quarter, and the magnitude of that improvement could be as much as 50 to 100 basis points. We do not anticipate any Sony royalties in the first quarter. After many quarters of over estimating operating expenses, I truly believe operating expenses will increase in the first quarter. We will add the operating cost of the ULi acquisition, along with the revenue, and we will not get the benefit of the vacations and holidays that were taken in the fourth quarter. This, together with the headcount additions we have made, should cause operating expenses to increase by 5 to 10% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter will also be the first time we include stock option expenses in our results. We anticipate that the expense will be approximately $20 million in the quarter. The tax rate will be affected by the option expensing, but the anticipated tax rate without option expensing would be 16%, plus or minus a percent. When you include option expensing, the tax rate could be lower. With that I will turn it back over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer: Fiscal 2006 was a milestone year for NVIDIA. Because of the growth initiatives that we set in motion last year, we're well-positioned to have another strong year. Let me outline our key growth drivers. Growth in desktop GPU will be driven by share gains, Microsoft Windows Vista, and the introduction HD and Blu-ray DVD. We will continue to rollout our 90 nanometer GeForce MX Family over the next few months, and expect to extend our technology and performance leadership from an already strong position. Windows Vista represents the most significant OS transition in the history of the PC, and delivering a new experience built on top of modern GPUs, translucent glass, light compositing and animations. This experience will be available only to users on machines that have sufficient GPU processing power. According to a recent report by Jon Peddie, 50% of the computers in use can't run Vista Glsss. We expect this to increase GPU adoption. 2006 will also be the year of high-definition video. Sony PlayStation 3 will drive Blu-ray and HD video into the world. We expect Blu-ray and HD to drive increased demand for the video costs and capabilities of our next generation GPUs. Growth in notebook GPU. The GeForce 7 delivers the best performance and performance per watt advantage. Our design win success for the spring 2006 Napa Refresh was the best in our Company's history. By at the end of the year our notebook segment share is expected to more than double. Growth in our professional solutions business will be driven by the demand for HD content creation, HD video editing and broadcast. Growth in MCP will be driven by continued share gains in AMD Server, workstation, desktop and notebook. In addition with our first ever mainstream Intel nForce 4 MCP we have expanded our addressable market. Growth driven by Sony PlayStation 3, as I mentioned previously, we have had production silicon for some time. Growth in 3G multimedia. Our GoForce handheld GPU business continues to make great progress. Our strategy is to build a new class of ultra low power GPUs for multimedia rich devices like 3G cell phones, smart phones, and portable media players. This week with the announcement of our GoForce 5500, we're enabling DVD resolution digital TV on cell phones for the first time. According to industry researcher, Yankee Group, the market for mobile video is expected to reach $2 billion by 2008. Mario Morales of IDC recently said \"high-quality multimedia services are a key revenue driver for the world's carriers and content providers.\" And we believe we will see significant uptake of these services in 2006. Companies like NVIDIA whose products deliver compelling and tangible improvements to the overall end-user experience of these new services are well placed to take advantage of this surge in demand. Not only is the 5500 the most advanced handheld GPU ever built, it is our first that will scale to mainstream segments. With the 5500 architecture, we will serve both the 3G as well as the 2.5 G markets. With more growth drivers than ever this year, it is setting up to be another year of strong growth. At this point we would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you sir, at this time I would like to remind everyone if you would like to ask a question, press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Hey guys, another great quarter.\nA - Marvin D. Burkett: Thanks a lot Mark.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: I just have three very brief questions, if I could. One, Marv, in the other income in the quarter it was down more than I would have thought. Is there some charge that took place there? And then when you guys expect PlayStation 3 royalties to begin?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Yes, there was a slight charge there. As we repatriated the cash from the foreign subsidiary under the Jobs Creation Act, we had to liquidate some investments. And based on the fact that interest rates have gone up, when you liquidated those investments you incurred a slight loss. But in the whole scheme of things it was small.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Great. And PlayStation 3 royalties, when would you expect that to first hit the P&L?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: We haven't, we're being rather cautious about what we say about PlayStation 3 simply because PlayStation Street is not our product. It is Sony's product. And the only thing that I can help you with is that we are completed with our RSX design work, and we have production silicon in hand. At this point it is up to Sony and their aggressive march towards the marketplace.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Fair enough. Just a last question, can you give us a general sense as to where the notebook business is in terms of GPUs on a percent of revenue basis here in the fourth quarter?\nA - Marvin Burkett: It is north of 5% slightly.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Thanks a lot guys. Nice job.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nQ - Simona Jankowski: Hi, thank you so much. First question just quickly is, can you comment on what percent of your desktop GPUs are based on the Series 7, and similarly for your notebook GPU's?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Small in the fourth quarter. You're referring to the fourth quarter, I take it?\nQ - Simona Jankowski: Yes, both for the desktop and for the notebooks.\nA - Marvin Burkett: It is small but growing very, very rapidly. In the desktop it is probably, I don't know, 20%. In notebook it is higher than that.\nQ - Simona Jankowski: And then the second one is on the Sony revenue. Did you say how much it was in the quarter? I may have missed it. And also, if you're going to beginning license revenues this current quarter?\nA - Marvin Burkett: The answer to the second one, were we going to be getting license revenue, yes, absolutely. The license revenue is a fixed amount for most of, through this year. So we will get that. The amount of revenue for Sony in the fourth quarter was on the order of $20 million, which includes license as well as NRE.\nQ - Simona Jankowski: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.\nQ - Michael McConnell: Thank you. Looking at the MCP business, could you give us an idea about what you expect that business to grow in fiscal '07 year-over-year? And what is the drive behind the exceptional growth you're seeing in that business?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: As you know, the way I think about our MCP business is this, we're really the only Company in the world that serves every single segments of the AMD market. We're the only Company that provides SLI for the AMD platform. We are the only Company that, we're clearly the Company that is recognized with the best technology for the AMD platform. And this year, I guess this quarter was our first quarter where we entered into the integrated graphics marketplace again. And we had invested a great deal of time to create an architecture that is both high-performance but extremely low cost, because as you know integrated graphics is rather price competitive. And so this is the first time where we have now been able to address every single segment from notebook to desktop to workstation to servers. And the number of AMD CPUs that are going to be shipped in the marketplace is pretty significant next year. I think the integrated marketplace alone was predicted to be about 25 million units next year. My expectation is that we should capture a majority of that. So how big can our core logic business be? Pretty sizable. My expectation is that it will continue to be the fastest growing business by absolute amounts, absolute dollars. And can we double it this year? Probably. I think the long-term of it of course is that we're going to continue to bring new ideas to that marketplace. But we are also going to invest more into the Intel mainstream marketplace as we recently rolled out our first mainstream product by Intel. So anyways, I think the net of it all is that this is going to be very important growth product for us. From a strategic perspective it is really important, because more and more of the capabilities of a PC really involve the core logic. And so products like SLI, capabilities like SLI really aren't possible unless you simultaneously design the core logic, the GPU, the software, as well as of all the marketing that goes behind bringing this type of capability into the marketplace. It seems like SLI and others that were in the process of developing are going to require a lot of core logic expertise.\nQ - Michael McConnell: Maybe on the gross margin side and the effect of this growth that MCP has, with your targets of 45% by the end of fiscal '07, how should we think of MCP in relation to the target? Some people are concerned that this will weigh against the gross margin line. So if you could talk about that a little bit that would be great.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I think all businesses need to do several things simultaneously. You need to grow your top line. You need to grow your bottom line. And you need to grow you're strategic influence on the marketplace. And we have multiple business drivers in our Company, and not every single one of them can simultaneously solve all three. And in the case of core logic, it is going to contribute to the top line. Its gross margins are slightly behind our corporate average, but it is not so poor that it drags it significantly. And then lastly the strategic impact of a strong core logic I think is very important. I think overall we're still comfortable with, we still believe that we are going to hit mid 40s target, and the whole Company is working towards getting there.\nQ - Michael McConnell: Thank you very much.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nQ - Sidney Ho: Thank you. Just to follow-up with the MCP question. You said the margins, first of all, for Q4 do you say it is up 27% quarter over quarter in terms of revenue?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Yes.\nQ - Sidney Ho: Okay. How much of that revenue is coming from the SLI chipsets, if you could give that?\nA - Marvin Burkett: The quick answer is we don't know.\nQ - Sidney Ho: Let me ask another question related to that. In terms of, well, you had pretty good growth last quarter. Margins are okay, but if you look at Q3 your offering margin for that business is around 5%. I assume that number has gone up this quarter because of higher revenue. What revenue run rate do you think that business needs to do to generate say like 15% margin?\nA - Marvin Burkett: We passed it.\nQ \u2013 Sidney Ho: Okay, thank you.\nA - Jen-Hsun Hang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Satya Chillara with American Technology Research. Please go ahead.\nQ - Satya Chillara: Yeah, hi guys. Jen-Hsun, can you comment on the WMP business for fiscal '07, what did you guys do for your fiscal Q4?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Did you want to answer the second part first, and then I will answer the 2007?\nA - Marvin Burkett: The WMP business for Q4 was in the $25 million range.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: My expectation is that 2007 ought to be much larger. I think, we have always felt that the handheld marketplace was going to go through a bit of a revolution when broadband, when storage, when high-resolution displays emerged as a capability on handheld devices. All of a sudden these devices have become powerful digital devices. And we know what it is capable of doing given the state of technology. So we have always felt that if the technology were to come together it would create a market for GPUs. And the GPUs when combined with the availability of multimedia content would create quite a nice market for us. We are seeing all kinds of excitement around our GPUs around the marketplace. And the design win momentum is very exciting for us. My expectation is that we're going to continue to grow with the 3G market this year. We're going to grow because more and more cell phone vendors are incorporating GPUs, so that they can process the multimedia content. We also for the first time are going to create a mainstream segment of our GPUs to go after 2.5 G. And we already have very exciting design wins behind us. I think this business is going to be one of our most exciting growth businesses. As we go into the year, we will expand our offering to include smart phones and portable media players. And as you can imagine all of these segments are very exciting growth segments.\nQ - Satya Chillara: On this do you think the business, at this point do you have good visibility or is it still going to be lumpy the entire year?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I don't mind, I don't really mind its lumpiness as much as most people do. The lumpiness comes from the fact that cell phones tend to be lumpy businesses. It just so happens at there is 700 million cell phone sold. So that the lumpiness, well, it is still pretty lumpy actually, even at 700 million units. It is a very seasonal business. The visibility comes from these design wins. I know what designs that went in, and I know we are working with. And so the visibility from that perspective is quite good. So the design win perspective is very good. The lumpiness comes from the seasonality in the business. And my expectation is that it won't go away anytime soon. And it is also not an issue by the way. I'm not too worried about it at all.\nQ -Satya Chillara: Okay great thank you.\nA- Jen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Schafer of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.\nQ - Dan Morris: Hi, this is actually Dan Morris calling for Rick. Thanks for taking my question. I meant to ask you a follow-up question on the notebook. Maybe if you could comment on what your expectations are for notebook in 2007. I think you are getting pretty good traction there. And also to what you might attribute that momentum?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: One of the things that we know about the notebook business is that architectural efficiency is everything. This is the business where having the highest performance architecture and having the highest performance per unit energy expanded per watt, and you have heard the CPU vendors talk endlessly about per watt for this very reason. The notebook market, obviously the notebook itself has a constrained thermal budget and a constrained electrical budget, and so it is important that you have the most efficient architecture. Using brute force just simply doesn't work in the notebook market. We know that the GeForce 7 has the highest performance and the highest performance per watt of any GPUs out there. And so inherently it is going to be a better GPU for notebooks. And we are seeing the adoption of it as a result. The second thing is this year of course you're going to have HD DVD and Blu-ray introduced later on in the year. And so that is going to increase adoption of GPUs. You're going to see the adoption of Vista later in the year. That is going to drive adoption of GPUs. So I think that this year we're going to benefit from having, number one, a far more competitive architecture. Number two, our design win momentum is already very strong. And number three, which will benefit all the GPUs suppliers, is Vista and high-definition video desktop to drive GPU adoption. And so my sense is that our notebook business is going to do quite well this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nQ - Krishna Shankar: Yes. Congratulations on a good quarter. Marv, for your fiscal '06 as a whole, can you just give us an approximate breakdown of revenues between desktop discrete, desktop notebook and MCPs can you give us what revenue is there for the year fiscal '06?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Why don't we do that off-line. Why don't give me a call after this and I will talk to you.\nQ - Krishna Shankar: Then in terms of the high-end graphics market can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape there? Do you folks see yourselves strengthening and widening your lead in high-end desktop graphics, or do you see the competitive environment getting a little more vigorous going forward there into calendar '06?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Well, let me see, GeForce 6 was, we took the crown on GeForce 6. We then introduced GeForce 7 and 7800. And I guess I don't have anything to announce today. But I think the buzz around the industry is that we have something to announce soon, which would be pretty exciting. And my expectation is that the high-end marketplace is really about technology leadership. It is really about the ability to produce the products. And it is also about SLI. And when I think that, I don't think it is a surprise to you if I told you that the majority of the world's game enthusiasts have SLI in their system. And SLI is really only available from us. And so the next generation GPU will also have SLI backwards compatible. And we are expecting performance to be obviously very good. So I think that the marketplace has really changed since the introduction of SLI. You really need to have high-end motherboards and high-end core logic like nForce SLI. You need to have high-end GPUs. And you need to be able to combine the two so that you can deliver the type of performance that enthusiasts demand.\nQ - Krishna Shankar: Thank you.\nA- Jen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Moors & Cabot. Please go ahead.\nQ - Hans Mosesmann: Thank you. Gentlemen, if you could go back to performance per watt subject, what kind of advantages do you expect have, or can you quantify your advantages in the performance per watt arena, at least the notebook in calendar 2006?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Our per watt is something along the lines of 60% better than the competition on the high-end. On our high-end GPUs it is an extraordinary difference. The performance that we can deliver and the power envelope that we can stay within is a dramatic difference, not a small difference. It is a dramatic difference compared to the competition. In a lot of ways your performance is partly related to the design, but it is partly related to your die size, and as you know, our die size is substantially smaller than the competition's die size. And so having architectural efficiency, having lower leakage, having better performance per watt really compounds quickly on the notebook platform. And so my expectation is that our next generation high-end that, I guess we just recently announced it, should have an overwhelming advantage in the notebook market. And my sense is that the design wins will reflect that very quickly.\nQ - Hans Mosesmann: Okay, thanks a lot.\nA- Jen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Hans.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan Securities. Please go ahead.\nQ - Shawn Webster: Hi, thank you, yes. Could you comment on the GPU unit and pricing, what they did sequentially in Q4, and maybe some expectations for Q1?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Units were relatively flat to slightly down, and ASP was relatively flat to slightly up. That is in desktop GPUs.\nQ - Shawn Webster: Desktop, do you have a all in GPU unit and ASP change?\nA - Marvin Burkett: No, we break it down between the various components, which is the notebook, the desktop, and the workstation. Obviously, the ASPs of those are so different that it doesn't make sense to merge them together.\nQ - Shawn Webster: The GPU segment itself was it up 1 or 2%, or what was the end number for that in Q4?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Almost dead flat.\nQ - Shawn Webster: Dead flat. Okay. Can you talk about your gross margin trends by segment, I guess segment meeting GPU, MCP, your handheld business, what they did sequentially?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Yes, I think the most dramatic increase in gross margin was in the MCP area. Gross margins were up very nicely there. The GPU business was relatively flat, but it still had very good gross margins, higher than the corporate average. And in the handheld business the gross margins are much lower. But the improvement quarter to quarter was in the MCP business.\nQ - Shawn Webster: And then as far as your linearity, I think you said things were pretty linear in the quarter. Did you see any growth in orders or any kind of changes in the month of January?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Yes, the month in January had Chinese New Year's at the very end. So it basically, the customer basically disappears the last week of our quarter. But we anticipated that. We always knew that that was there, so it was not unexpected.\nQ - Shawn Webster: Okay thanks a lot.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: It was actually a short Q4.\nA - Marvin Burkett: Yes, it was basically a 12 week Q4.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Alger with Pacific Growth Equity. Please go ahead.\nQ - Brian Alger: Hi guys. Pretty impressive stuff. Two questions. A near-term one for Marvin, a longer-term maybe for you, Jen-Hsun. On the near-term, Marv, can you maybe talk to the specific levers that you think you're going to be able to pull on to generate that 50 to 100 basis point gross margin improvement in the next quarter? And longer-term, Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk to the implications for the game console cycle coming around at the same time as an operating system upgrade, which I think is the first time we have seen this?\nA - Marvin Burkett: I will take the gross margin. I can't emphasize this enough that gross margin improvement doesn't come from any one thing. It comes from a lot of different programs and projects that we have in place. We continue to do, and we continue to get better at them. We will benefit we think in Q1 by the new products that we're introducing that had very good gross margins. Yes, we think we'll get some benefit off of that. But we also think we'll get some benefit by the continued hard work in all of the other areas. The improvement in gross margins that we saw in Q4 for MCP is another example of that. So it is not in any one area.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Let me see if I can interpret your question. You are a good questioner, and it certainly makes you think. I think, at some level the game market is, between the PC and the game console, is becoming increasingly uncorrelated, if you will. And the reason for that is because, as you know very well, that the genre of games that are being played on each platform are increasingly different. The genre for PCs are increasingly oriented to massive, online players and role-playing games and related to team play, related to first person shooters, if you will. The game console is much more popular with the sports genres and the racing genres. It is a reflection of the ease-of-use, if you will of those genres on the various platforms. The thing that we are seeing with the PC industry, and one of the things that we are very excited about, is the number of teenagers who are simply spending more time in front of your personal computer, in front of, as they are surfing the Web on myspace.com or watching videos on UTube or whatnot. They're just spending a lot more time in front of their PCs and playing large virtual world games on PCs. And so I think that, the PC is just becoming a completely alternative game platform, and a serious game platform at that. I think we're just not seeing nearly the correlation that we used to back in the good old days, some four, five years ago where a PC was viewed upon as competitive to the game console. We just don't see it that way. We see them completely different platforms for different uses at different cycles.\nQ - Brian Alger: Vista?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Vista. And on the second topic of Vista, it is just a really nice operating system. And I think it is going to be a really terrific operating system. The user interface is totally different. And it is built as you know completely on GPUs. I have not seeing a larger volume GPU application driver than Vista before. This is going to be very exciting. I'm anxious to see how it turns out.\nQ - Brian Alger: Do you think the Vista transition has greater implications on the notebook market?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I think it will have implications on both. I think, it is just, it is so different. It just, as you know, it just looks different, it feels different, it uses differently. It makes advances in so many different areas that we wanted to make advance. And I just think that it is going to change PCs all the way through.\nQ - Brian Alger: Thanks. Good job.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Yeah thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question is from Daven Moodley from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.\nQ - Devan Moodley: Hi guys. The first question for Marv. That cash balance is pretty big relative to where it has been. Where do you think you guys, what are your plans for that?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Not to give it away. It is big but we have had $1 billion in cash before. What are our plans? We continue to make acquisitions. We're acquiring ULi for cash. We will continue to do that. We will continue to acquire, hopefully, for cash. We do still have a stock buyback program in place. So we will continue to do that. Those are two uses. We have been doing that and we still are building cash, so that is good news. I would tell you beyond those two things that we expect to continue, we don't have any huge plans for what we're going to do with that cash.\nQ - Devan Moodley: Just a bigger picture question, going back to Vista, maybe if I could put some numbers out there. In Q4 I think the discrete integrated split for the whole market. According to Mercury it was about one-third, two-thirds. Where do you think that is in Q4 '06? And what you think that goes based on what you have seen Vista, what you have seen of Vista just so far?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I guess we probably see the world as more 45, 55 by the time that you're done including all of the double attached. Sometimes people will make a motherboard out of integrated graphics, but put a graphics adapter on it. And in fact, we see a lot of that. My sense is that that is going to continue. I'm not really a market analyst, so I really can't tell you how it is going to shake out. But I can tell you that Vista uses a lot more graphics horsepower than our previous operating system did. And it requires a lot more of the programmable shading that is provided by GPUs. And the experience is just better when the GPU performance is better. I think that my sense is that it is going to bias it towards GPUs off of norm, and we will see what happens. My sense is that a 10% swing on a very, very large market makes a very large difference, as you know.\nQ - Devan Moodley: Just one quick follow-up. Do you think it is a bubble or do you think it is a fundamental change that will last?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: The definition of a bubble is I guess something that lasts a quarter. I don't think it will last a quarter. But it is really about the fact that the infrastructure itself, the OS itself can actually enhance user experience going forward. It is possible for people to build applications on top of the operating system that takes advantage of the GPU. It is actually not possible today. And so are they going to be add-ons to Vista? My guess is well I don't know for sure, but if I would be a guessing person I would say absolutely. The follow on add-on packs and aftermarket GPU add-ons and graphics add-ons are going to, are just going to be abundant because the infrastructure enables it to. The confabulators of Vista are going to come as you know. And so the gidgets of Vista are going to come. And you're going to see more and more of those kinds of things. There will be video gidgets, stock ticker price gidgets. There will be weather gidgets. There will be CNN gidgets. There will be all kinds of little gidgets that comes out. And all of it is just going to attach to your GPU, which is good. That is my assessment.\nQ \u2013 Daven Moodley: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Dennison with UBS. Please go ahead.\nQ - Robert Dennison: Hi guys, great quarter.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nQ - Robert Dennison: I wonder if I can verify, this time last year you guys suggested that Sony would\u2026..\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: You're breaking up quite a bit.\nQ - Robert Dennison: Sorry. Better?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Can you repeat your question again?\nQ - Robert Dennison: Sure. Last year at this time you guys said that Sony would be about 50 to 100 million plus annually in licensing and royalties. Should we still look at that number? And would with NREs coming into the picture as well in the first quarter, should that number, that range be adjusted at all?\nA - Marvin Burkett: My quick reaction to that is, no. Setting aside the royalties, if you just look at the license fee and NRE this year, forgetting, and I'm talking about the profitability of the NRE, not the overall revenue off the NRE, from a profit standpoint that is in the 70, $75 million for this year with no royalty. So depending on where you want to put the royalties under what magnitude, the $100 million is certainly not out of the question.\nQ - Robert Dennison: Mercury Research when they did their recent report indicated that there was what they thought was a significant buildup of chipsets, particularly in the AMD segment. Can you comment on what you guys are seeing in the channel in the way of chipset inventories, MCPs there? It looks like they're saying 30% or so over shipment of chipsets relative to GPUs that shipped in the first quarter.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: We have heard some anecdotal reports that AMD's CPU is experiencing shortages. Relative to run rates there is nothing really abnormal about what is going on. But if there some inventory buildup in the channel, what we believe is happening is that the CPU shortage is causing that. But there won't be a CPU shortage forever. Those segments, those motherboards that are being built are really purely for the motherboard segment. And I think the ecosystem for AMD processors is quite healthy. We feel pretty good about it.\nQ - Robert Dennison: Okay thank you.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Yeah thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Hi, Jen-Hsun, this is another point, our channel checks as we went through the quarter suggested that things were actually probably more constrained on SLI and some of your high-end desktop GPUs. So can you give us a sense as to what you are seeing in that regard? And then is that what caused the GPU business to be relatively flat quarter to quarter in your opinion?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: We were relatively constrained on high-end GPUs this quarter. And the reason for that of course is that we are moderating the build of last generation GPUs in favor of next generation GPUs. So my hope is that that constraint is going to workup shortly. So that is really just, managing our transition cautiously is really what was going on there.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Can you just quantify what memory was in the quarter?\nA - Marvin Burkett: Slightly short of 40 million, high 30s.\nQ - Mark Edelstone: Thanks a lot guys.\nA \u2013 Jen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arnab Chanda with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.\nQ - Arnab Chanda: Thank you, just a qualitative question for either Jen-Hsun or Marv. Could you talk a little bit about if you look at all the different segments that you have, you talked about how the chipset business could grow very strongly, as well of the WMP business. Overall, a question on revenues and margins. Do you think that that tends to accelerate your revenue growth rate into the high teens or even higher for the overall Company, including some of the effects of Vista and things like that? And also secondly, what type of influence would that have on your gross margin direction? Thank you.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I guess the two growth drivers that you mentioned are, tend to be lower gross margin, lower relative to our corporate standard and lower relative to our other higher gross margin businesses certainly. However, we also have very high gross margin growth coming. The PlayStation 3 growth is very high gross margin growth. Our Quadro professional services, excuse me, professional solution business is very high gross margin growth. Our GPU business continues to be high gross margin growth. And I expect our GPU to grow this year. We ought to be capturing share, and we're going to go capture share. And so there it is, we have plenty of high gross margin growth opportunities, and we have plenty of high topline growth opportunities.\nQ - Arnab Chanda: Thank you.\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nasar Iqbal with Salman Partners.\nQ - Naser Iqbal: Hi guys, congratulations on a very excellent quarter. Just a first quick clarification, when you mentioned that the NREs and royalties were roughly 20 million, was the similar amount for Q3 roughly about 10 million?\nA - Marvin Burkett: That's correct.\nQ - Naser Iqbal: Then just going forward, in terms of your competitors coming out with their next generation product, and you know gen's timeframe when typically it is in the March/June timeframe. Has that changed your launch schedule? And particularly at the $200 price point, when are we going to see a Series 7 GPU on the desktop side?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: I guess our schedules are really dictated by I guess our schedules. We try to introduce new products to the marketplace as often as we can, and try to keep the competitive pressure on. And try to keep raising the bar and passing more value on to our customers. So those are things that we just generally try to do. Our competition has a new GPU, but we know what it is and we're not intimidated by it. We have some pretty exciting stuff that we're rolling out. I don't know how many seasons now that we've had the performance leadership position. It has been quite a few as you can probably remember now. And our expectation is that we will have a performance leadership position this season. We're going to get it rolled out as quickly as we can. And my expectation is that it is going to be a pretty successful and pretty exciting new product line. In terms of the segment that you're talking about, we are driving new architecture, GeForce 7, from top to bottom. And we have announced our top to bottom lineup for mobile. The adoption of it is very exciting. And we know that we have a performance advantage. We know we have a performance per watt advantage. We also know that we have an SLI advantage. And so we're going to be aggressive to roll those things out from like top to bottom as fast as we can.\nQ - Naser Iqbal: If I could just ask one top picture view. Just for the gaming market, are you seeing any kind of an advantage or any kind of a benefit from dual-core shift? It doesn't appear to be any, but do you think that could change going forward?\nA - Jen-Hsun Huang: The gamers are, the priority is kind of like this. Number one, the performance has to be very good, the absolute performance. Whether it is one core or two, the absolute performance has to be good. As you know, CPU performance is a combination of the performance of the core, the frequency of it, the architecture of the overall system, the architecture of the core logic. It is a combination of a lot of different things. And so the performance is important. The second thing is price is important. Most gamers are younger, and disposable income is a little bit more challenged. And so pricing is important. The third thing of course is the brand is really important. The gamers know and trust certain brands. One of the things that we really value is the importance of our brand GeForce and the importance of the SLI brands. SLI, particularly in the gamer marketplace, means that there is a variety of GPUs you can buy, both new as well as old. You can buy old GPUs from your friends. The variety of GPUs, or MCPs core logics with SLI capability, a variety of power supplies that has been certified, memories that have been certified, chassis have been certified. And you can piece them together, because most gamers love to build their own PC. It also suggests that compatibility between all these configurations and applications are what the gamers would expect. It will deliver wonderful scaling capability as well as compatibility. All of these in combination is what the gamer is looking for. Is dual-core, if it satisfies all of those things, is having two cores better than one? I guess so. There is no harm done anyways. Right?\nQ - Naser Iqbal: Great. Thanks, and congratulations again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you all for joining us today.

Today we are pleased to report record revenue of $878.9 million for our fourth quarter. This is our fourth consecutive record quarter. Year over year, fourth quarter revenue grew 39%. For the year, we delivered record revenue of $3.07 billion, an increase of 29% over the previous year.  Let me highlight some of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 results and achievements. As a note, all share numbers quoted are from Mercury Research unless otherwise noted.  Non-GAAP annual gross margin for the year reached a company-high of 43.2%, an increase of 490 basis points year over year. GAAP annual gross margin was 42.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter reached a company-high of 44.2%, an increase of 130 basis points sequentially from the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and 400 basis points year over year. GAAP gross margin was 43.9%.  Non-GAAP net income was $577.9 million, an increase of 91% year over year. GAAP net income was a record $448.8 million.  We launched multiple industry-defining products during the year: the revolutionary GeForce 8800, the industry's most powerful GPU and the first DX10 unified shader GPU; nForce 400 family, the industry's first single-chip motherboard GPU chipset; PureVideo HD, the industry's first solution for full HD Blu-ray processing; Quadro Plex, the world's first ultra high-density visual computing system; and the revolutionary CUDA architecture for GPU computing.  We maintained our number one position in desktop GPUs. The desktop GPU business delivered a record year, with $1.24 billion in revenue, growing 11% year over year.  Our share in the performance segment grew to over 85%, up from 79% a year earlier.  We captured the number one notebook GPU position, with our share increasing to 58%, up 20% from the previous year. Notebook GPU revenue grew 122% year over year.  Our overall PC graphics share increased from 18% a year ago to 29% today.  The nForce MCP product line achieved record revenue for its tenth consecutive quarter. Revenue grew over 16% sequentially from the third quarter and 89% year over year.  The Quadro professional product line achieved a record revenue, an increase of 24% from the fourth quarter fiscal 2006.  The handheld GPU product line delivered $108 million in revenue, an increase of 85% from the previous year.  Sony launched the PlayStation 3 with our RSX GPU.  We completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, a leading supplier of software and SOC application processors for mobile devices like Apple's iPods.  NVIDIA was named the most respected public company by the members of the Fabless Semiconductor Association.  Finally, with AMD's acquisition of ATI, NVIDIA became the only independent GPU company in the world.  We are pleased with our record year -- particularly, we are very pleased with our strategic position going into fiscal 2008.  Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. I will return in a moment to address our growth opportunities. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Today, we are reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP P&Ls for our Q4 and fiscal year '07.  As Jen-Hsun said, revenue for the fourth quarter was $879 million, which is up 7.1% or $58 million from the third quarter. Revenue for the fiscal year was $3.07 billion, which is up 29% year over year.  In the fourth quarter, growth was led by MCP products, which increased by 16% quarter to quarter and, as Jen-Hsun said, was a record for the tenth consecutive quarter. Total MCP revenue grew 88% for the whole fiscal year.  Professional solutions products grew by 14% sequentially and also set a record for revenue.  In the desktop GPU business, the GeForce 8800 products grew by more than $50 million but were offset by weakness in some of the GeForce 7 products, particularly in the channel.  Memory grew by $10 million quarter to quarter.  Our consumer electronics revenue increased 40% sequentially, driven by significantly higher contributions of royalty payments, which more than offset a decline in MRE.  ASPs were slightly down in desktop GPUs, and relatively flat everywhere else.  We closed the purchase of PortalPlayer on January 5th, but the revenue contribution from Portal was not significant, approximately $1 million.  For gross margin in the quarter, we reported non-GAAP gross margin of 44.2% and GAAP gross margin of 43.9%. Our 45% target is getting close. GPUs, MCPs and handheld business units all improved gross margin quarter to quarter. As a company, we continue to work hard on improvement.  Operating expenses for the quarter were $247 million on a GAAP basis and $203 million on a non-GAAP. The non-GAAP eliminated stock-based compensation of $34 million before tax effect and it eliminated $13.4 million of in-process R&D associated with the PortalPlayer acquisition.  The $203 million included one month of PortalPlayer expenses, which totaled approximately $5 million, and it also included legal and accounting fees associated with the restatement of approximately $4 million, the restatement which was filed in December.  Including PortalPlayer, we added 456 new employees during the quarter and exited the year with 4,083 employees. For the year, we added over 1,300 new employees.  Depreciation in the quarter was $30 million.  The tax rate for the fiscal year and for the fourth quarter included the benefit of Congress passing the R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of calendar year 2006. This resulted in lowering both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates. It lowered the GAAP tax rate by 7 percentage points to slightly over 9% for the year and obviously a negative tax rate of 8% for the fourth quarter.  For non-GAAP, it lowered our fiscal year '07 rate by 6 percentage points to 10% and resulted in a negative tax rate of 3% for the quarter.  All of this resulted in GAAP net income for the quarter of $164 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, and a non-GAAP net income of $206 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.  On the balance sheet, we exited the year with $1.12 billion in cash and marketable securities, which was down $56 million from the prior quarter. This is after paying approximately $160 million net of cash and marketable securities for the acquisition of PortalPlayer and repurchasing $100 million worth of stock.  For the year, we repurchased $276 million worth of shares at an average cost of $26.80.  As a company, we generated more than $500 million in operating cash flow during the year.  Accounts receivable grew by $79 million quarter to quarter, as Q4 was back-end loaded. Our receivables are current and DSO was at 53.7 days.  Inventory declined by $19 million and resulted in days sales of inventory of 65 days. We grew inventory of the GeForce 8 family and decreased the inventory of older products.  Accounts Payable decreased by $52 million quarter to quarter.  Now for the outlook for Q1 fiscal year '08: for revenue, we expect a normal seasonal decline associated with the PC business of approximately 5%. Although we believe our market and competitive position in each of our business units continues to be very strong, there are no significant industry growth drivers to offset seasonality. Although we are enthusiastic about Vista's impact on our business, we will be cautious in the first quarter.  We expect a decline in memory from the Q4 levels.  We expect a revenue contribution from PortalPlayer of less than $10 million in the quarter.  For gross margin, we will continue to work hard to keep them flat to perhaps slightly improving.  On operating expenses, we have to absorb a full quarter of PortalPlayer, which will cause an increase of approximately $10 million from Q4. However, we believe that even with the additional expense, we may be able to keep operating expenses flat with Q4 as we focus on expense controls and restrict headcount additions.  We will get a small benefit in tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year '08, as we are projecting a tax rate of 14% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.  With that, I will turn it back to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. As we look ahead at fiscal 2008, we are very excited of our numerous growth drivers impacting each of our product lines. Let me discuss each of them in detail.  First, our GeForce desktop and notebook GPU business: GeForce 8800 is the world's first DX10 unified shader architecture GPU. It also incorporates PureVideo HD, the highest visual quality video processor for PCs and the only full HD video processing solution for HD and Blu-ray DVD. The GeForce 8800 is now available from virtually every PC OEM system builder worldwide and in most e-tail and retail outlet.  Since October, we shipped nearly 400,000 GeForce 8800s. Our focus for desktop GPU is to leverage our leadership position with GeForce 8 into the mainstream market.  We are ramping production on our GeForce 8 family of notebook GPUs, the industry's first DX10 and high-definition video GPU for notebooks. GeForce 8 will be the only DX10 GPU shipping in the upcoming Santa Rosa notebook launch. We expect our share of notebook GPUs to take another step up after this spring transition.  We are looking forward to an exciting year for our GPU business. Vista has shipped. This is the first operating system to present as a standard the power of the GPU to all applications -- applications from Office to Web 2.0 applications can now incorporate beautiful 3D effects because hundreds of millions of PCs will have Vista.  With Vista, DX10 and HD Blu-ray DVD at the height of technologies for PC this year, 3D graphics will become an ever-central part of our computing experience and the GPU will be more important than ever.  Our nForce MCP business: driven by the broadest product line of AMD-based chipsets supporting 8P commercial servers to consumer desktops and notebooks, we have become the number one supplier of MCPs for AMD-based PCs.  We ended the calendar year as the industry's second-largest supplier of chipsets, having more than tripled our share from just two years ago. OEMs have embraced our unique strategy of offering single-chip MCPs designed specifically to reduce space and power consumption, while offering outstanding quality and performance.  Our motherboard GPU product line is favored by PC manufacturers around the world. These customers prominently feature our GeForce brand to differentiate their PCs from basic integrated graphics. Our \u201cGraphics by NVIDIA\u201d logo is proudly on display on new Windows Vista PCs on retail shelves all around the world.  In Q4, we announced our new nForce 680i SLI for Intel CPUs. Our new product line was received enthusiastically by customers and reviewers around the world and quickly became the top-selling, high-end motherboard in multiple e-tail and retail chains.  The NVIDIA nForce brand is unambiguously recognized as the best chipset for performance PCs and dominates the top 10 rankings in the majority of industry motherboard reviews worldwide.  For fiscal 2008, our key growth objectives are to deliver exciting new motherboard GPU products for the Intel CPU segment and maintain our leadership position on [inaudible] platforms. We believe that Intel-based customers will demand the NVIDIA GeForce-branded motherboard GPUs and we expect an enthusiastic response to our launch later this year.  Now our Quadro professional solutions group business: NVIDIA's Quadro professional business had an outstanding year. Annual revenue grew 21% versus fiscal 2006. NVIDIA Quadro is recognized as the standard for professional graphic solutions needed to solve the world's most complex visual computing challenges in the manufacturing, entertainment, medical, science and aerospace industries.  This year, we introduced Quadro Plex, an entirely new category of visual computing solutions. Quadro Plex brings the level of graphics scalability and processing density that was simply not possible before.  In Q4, we began feeding the industry with our GeForce 8 GPU enabled with CUDA, a revolutionary technology and compiler that for the first time allows programmers to write \u201cC\u201d language applications for GPUs. GeForce 8 and CUDA will enable a new class of high-performance computing we call GPU computing. With a CUDA-enabled GPU, the PC will enable engineers and scientists to harness the awesome power of programmable GPUs to solve mathematically intensive problems that were previously cost-prohibitive.  Based on the early response we are getting from programmers, scientists and engineers, it is apparent that we are delivering an enabling technology that will profoundly change a number of computing industries. We believe GPU computing will usher in an era of the personal super-computer and will dramatically accelerate the adoption of new methods from computational chemistry to computational finance to computational genomics.  This is an exciting new application to the programmable GPU. We look forward to telling you more about GPU computing throughout the coming year.  Our GoForce mobile application processor and GPU business: in fiscal year 2007, our mobile business grew revenue to $108 million, an increase of over 85%. The mobile group enjoyed tremendous success in Europe this summer with the successful rollout of the world's largest DVB-H trial.  The Samsung P910 device delivered World Cup content to well over half-a-million consumers. Our mobile TV success continues in the APAC region with two exciting new handsets coming from Japan this month: the Kyocera W51K and W52K both support the ISDB-T Japanese mobile TV standard.  We completed the PortalPlayer acquisition on January 5th and it marks our entry into the SOC application processor business. Up to now, our mobile strategy has been to focus on establishing ourselves in the mobile market as the leader of multimedia technologies, leveraging our deep expertise in graphics, video and image processing.  With PortalPlayer's expertise in building extremely low-power application processors for personal media players, we are now positioned to deliver amazing SOCs that combine our world-class application processors and GPUs.  Our objective in the mobile business group is to build a new class of application processors that will power next generation devices like Apple's iPhone, the Blackberry Pearl and other exciting smartphones and PNPs over the horizon, and help drive what I believe will be the next computer revolution: where the mobile device is no longer just a phone, but becomes our most personal computer.  We would be happy to take your questions now. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Hello, Mark? \nMichael Hara: No Mark. \nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: -- over the next six months or so, and then I have a follow-up on the application processor. \nMichael Hara: Mark, your question got cut out in the first part. Can you repeat it, please? \n Mark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Sorry, I just wanted to see if Jen-Hsun could talk a little bit about the rollout of the rest of the [GeForce 8000] family here over the next several quarters. \nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, the core of our business starts from first building in the basic architecture itself, and it usually starts at the [enthusiast] [inaudible]. The GeForce 8800 has beaten the competition to market by well over six months and counting. It is the core by which we build our notebook GPU family, the rest of our desktop GPU family, our professional graphics solutions, our GPU computing products, as well as our motherboard GPU products, what other people call integrated graphics.  It is the core to a lot of other businesses that we are in today. The GeForce 8800 has ramped up very nicely, as you know, Mark, and at the moment, every single one of the businesses I just mentioned are in the process of taking that GeForce 8 core and driving it deep into their business.  We are not ready to announce any products today but I can assure you that every single one of those businesses have GeForce 8 throughout their product and are either ramping already or on the verge of ramping production. \nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: So can you just give us a sense as to when you would expect to see the crossover so that the GeForce 8 family overall becomes your highest unit volume product? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Unit volume, Mark? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Unit volume or revenue? \nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Well, whichever one you\u2019d like to address would be fine. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think in terms of units, it is going to take well into the latter part of the year, if not early next year, and the reason for that is because the GeForce 7 is such an incredibly efficient architecture and it is the lowest cost Vista premium solution that we know.  My sense is that we are going to continue to see quite a bit of success in GeForce 7 for people who would like to put together the lowest cost Vista premium machine, and so the volumes of the GeForce 7 family are going to continue well through this year and probably well through next year. The unit volume should be pretty high there.  In terms of the revenue crossover, I will let Marvin guess at it, but my guess is that it is probably going to be late Q3, Q4 timeframe. \nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great, and then just lastly, I saw your 6100 in Barcelona here this week and just wanted to see if you could provide some additional thoughts on how long it takes you to really get the application processor strategy going to where you would like it, and what you see as the potential here for that business over the next several years? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, we introduced our first application processor today, or this week, and this application processor, I hope you will agree, is just absolutely amazing. It was really the core reason why we acquired PortalPlayer. They have a really, really talented team that arguably built the world's first computer on a chip. It was the reason why the Apple engineers used it to build the iPod, which is really a computer with an operating system and a file system and connectivity and was dedicated to media processing. Their obsession about low-power design has really enabled them to build some amazing products.  They had this application processor in the back room and what you are seeing now, the 6100, is the first of its kind. Our companies are now, our two engineering groups are now completely combined and the roadmap has been integrated. We brought the company on board on January 5th and in a very short period of time, we have realigned our strategies and now we are going to go build application processors that combine their expertise of building SOCs and our expertise of building GPUs.  My hope is that this year, we will introduce an amazing product towards the end of the year and next year, I hope that we get a lot of business traction as a result of that.  This is by far the single largest new [team] that our company has grown into. It is hard to say exactly how big this [inaudible] is going to be, but you know, application processors, it is probably close to $4 billion to $6 billion in size already. This particular marketplace is quickly transitioning to multimedia and graphics processing because of all the smartphones and portable media players and the combining of these two types of devices that we are seeing out there.  My sense is that we are going to be right in the epicenter of a lot of exciting new devices pretty soon. This is a very, very exciting development for our company. \nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Gurinder Kalra with Bear Stearns. \nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Hi, a couple of questions: firstly, can you update us on your roadmap as far as Intel-based chipsets are concerned? Where do you see volume ramp of that as we look through the year? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We have not really announced any of our products yet. I think the market has been very vocal about inviting us, if you will, to come and participate in this marketplace and the reason for that is because even in the Intel market, there needs to be a branded motherboard GPU alternative for the consumer segments and the multimedia rich type segments where graphics are really important.  Now, with Vista Premium coming out and all the applications that are coming out in 3D, it is really important to make sure that your GPU software and architecture is as prolific as possible, and so we know that the market has a significant demand for our product. We are just racing as fast as we can to get there.  I do not have anything to announce to you today but we have a lot of focus inside the company to develop products for that segment. \nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Thanks. My second question is with AMD talking about Fusion and with there being talk that Intel is looking to do something on the Discrete GPU lines, how do you suppose you are going to counteract that effort? Is there any talk that you might be looking to do something on the microprocessor front? \nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, we have all kinds of plans for developing products in the future. I do not really see the benefit of telling the market, or the competition particularly, what we are building several years out. I do not know why they are, to tell you the truth, unless they are panicked about something or feel somewhat apologetic about something else.  I think we have to keep all of our product roadmaps to ourselves.  You know, ultimately the thing that I do know is this: we are really good at building the technologies that you guys know we are great at building and we are focused as a company to differentiate by building products that consumers want to buy. My sense is that if the market wants to buy those products, we are going to know well in advance and we will build the right products for the marketplace.  So I do not see any particular reason why -- well, I guess just no comment. \nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: All right. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Satya Chillara with Pacific Growth Equities. \nSatya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Hi, good afternoon. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the cell-phone traction in fiscal '08? It seems in the last analyst day, you were pretty bullish on the cell-phone traction, with 2G as well as the 3G and so on. So where do you see the revenues growing from about a $100 million level to -- what kind of revenue growth do you expect here? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I still remain incredibly bullish about our mobile efforts.  In terms of 2.5G, we absolutely achieved our objective of capturing the design wins we wanted to capture. Unfortunately, a lot of our focus was on Motorola and, as you saw in some of the reports already, some of the phones that we were designed into were not as successful as we would like.  Net net, we ended up at $108 million for the year and grew 85% year-over-year. I am pretty sure, based on all the design wins that we have now, that this coming year is going to be more than $108 million. The question is how much more.  Secondarily, our focus now is we are going to continue to invest in GPUs but our primary focus is going to be in taking the GPU and the application processor components and putting them into an SOC. Our customers are all asking us for that and, based on the type of vision that the phone industry has conveyed to all of us, and some of the exciting new phones that are being talked about, the type of technology is very clear. Graphics processing is going to be important -- 3D graphics processing, so that you could do the type of user interfaces like Vista except doing it on the phone, is very exciting, and video processing and encoding.  There are all kinds of new capabilities that the phone manufacturers want to bring to the marketplace next year. So I think we are strategically extremely well-positioned. We just need to go execute and turn those design wins into business. \nSatya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Okay, so as a follow-up, in terms of Intel\u2019s low-end strategy, is that a single-chip strategy? Or only with single-chip would you enter the market? What is your thinking and strategy in terms of the Intel low-end strategy? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We started this trend of building a single-chip motherboard GPU, and it is the core logic -- all the connectivity, all of the graphics, all of the platform technologies, all integrated into one chip. The marketplace really, really likes it and the reason for that is because computers want to be smaller than ever and we want to drive the power down. The fewer chips you have in the system, the lower the cost, the lower the space requirement, the lower the power. From our perspective, fewer chips allow us to improve our margins. Technically, it is extremely complicated in the sense that you have to get mixed signal technology and IO technology and all of your connectivity technology on the same process, which tends to be very [inaudible] for GPUs, you know, all under the same process.  Technologically, it is a great challenge, but I think we happen to be one of those companies that really know how to pull it altogether, and so we are going to continue to take advantage of that leadership position. \nSatya Chillara - Pacific Growth Equities: Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason [Fellum] with Thomas Weisel Partners. Jason, your line is open. \nMichael Hara: Operator, go ahead and go to the next question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. \nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes, I was wondering if you can, Jen-Hsun, talk about the attach rate of discrete graphics for Vista and what you are seeing in terms of initial Vista demand and of the demand for the more Premium version of the operating system versus Basic, which will really drive requirements for your 8800 GPU. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I can tell you what logic would compel and what we believe, and in terms of real experiences, it is really hard to tell yet because Vista really just started shipping.  But what logic would compel is that Vista is the first operating system that is fully based on the programmability and the shading capability and the graphics rendering processing capability of a GPU, and it exposes this capability to not just the user interface but it exposes this capability to all applications. The compelling logic is that if the GPU is much more taxed and all of the applications use more 3D graphics capability, you would think that the GPU would be more relevant.  I think that there is no question as you use Vista, the experience is just far better with the GPU than when it is not. It is snappier and that is just the user interface, right? And so all of the operating system, all of the applications that use 3D graphics have not really even been exposed to this yet.  We know that there are many applications that are being developed where 3D graphics are going to make the application richer, many Web 2.0 applications, and we see many from Microsoft already that really exploits the capability of 3D. Even iTunes renders the album covers in 3D now.  There are all kinds of applications that are coming that take advantage of 3D graphics, so logic would certainly compel us to believe that GPUs will be more prevalently used. We believe that to be the case and so we are cautious in the first quarter as we go into it, but our belief is that GPUs will become more important than ever before. \nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Do you see the trend for notebooks also, where obviously Intel would be, the Centrino platform, they have 70% of that market. Do you see the trend reversing to where you see [an alternative] for discrete notebook solutions, and also MCPs for the notebook market? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the way we see it is that the notebook is really a form factor issue, and so we are going to go to the marketplace. If the form factor allows for a discrete GPU, we would offer the market a discrete GPU. But if the market would like a motherboard GPU, what is commonly called an integrated graphics chip, if motherboard GPU is the way they would like to power Vista, we are delighted by that as well and in fact, if you see our core logic business, the MCP business, it has grown dramatically year over year. A lot of that growth is because of motherboard graphics.  I think that there is some evidence that motherboard GPUs are just another way of accessing the capabilities of GPUs and we are going to see some continuous growth there. \nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Devan Moodley with Scotia Capital. \nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Hi, guys, just a follow-up question on Vista. If I look at the Mercury Research forecast currently for desktop discrete, they are looking for a single-digit decline in '07 but surprisingly, they are looking for almost 20% to 30% ASP growth in the desktop segment. Can you give me your perspective on what you are looking for and what would be the impact of Vista on the GF8 family tier? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I am not sure I picked up on the question. \nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Just ASPs, I guess -- Mercury is looking for ASPs to be up significantly this year in desktop discrete. What is your perspective of where your ASPs in that area will go? \n Jen-Hsun Huang: You know, Devan, our ASP has been growing pretty steadily over the years. I think it is logical to me because more and more of our computing experience is around the visual experience, and all of the most exciting applications, or many of the most exciting applications that we know, are really, really graphics rich.  The resolution of the display is being driven by Moore's Law and the color depth. On the other dimension, each pixel is moving faster than Moore's Law in the sense that the number of objects we render on each pixel and the color fidelity of each pixel is really going up quite dramatically. It stands to reason that more and more work needs to be done on the GPU, and if that is the case -- and more of your computing experience is depending on a GPU -- if that is the case, then ASPs ought to continue to grow.  If somebody told that ASP is going to grow steadily over the next several years, I guess I am not going to be surprised by that because historical evidence would suggest that is the case. \nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Okay, and just a quick housekeeping question: what was CapEx for the quarter and the year? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, our CapEx in the quarter was roughly $70 million, $71 million. However, there are a couple of factors in there that you should be aware of.  There was roughly $37 million of what I would call the normal CapEx, which is equipment and software that we bought. There is about $14 million worth of IP intangibles from investments that we made, and there is about $20 million of a re-class from our long-term assets into that account, so I would say that the normal CapEx was $37 million. \nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: And do you expect that to change significantly going into next year? \nMarvin D. Burkett: No. \nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Arnab Chanda with Lehman Brothers. \nArnab Chanda - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First of all, if you look at your MCP business, would that grow until your new Intel chipset is launched, or was it going to be sort of seasonal in the first part of the year? And then a follow-up, please. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We are expecting seasonal dynamics in the first quarter. We do have Intel core logic that we announced, as I mentioned earlier, the 680i, and the 680i has other segments that we are introducing. We are going to grow in the Intel core logic business through Q1. I do not know whether it is going to make up for the seasonal decline but we are not counting on it at the moment.  Then later, as the year progresses and as we launch our Intel CPU-based motherboard GPUs, we are expecting quite a bit of growth from that. \nArnab Chanda - Lehman Brothers: Thanks, Jen-Hsun, and last question: the computing GPU product that -- maybe I did not quite understand it properly, but is it something that will be sort of additive to your workstation business or is it sort of a new category? What type of additional market opportunity does that get for you guys? Thank you. \n Jen-Hsun Huang: The GPU computing initiative is absolutely additive, and I would argue that the industry has had a vacuum, or a super-computing crisis, for sometime. Scientists and researchers have been clamoring for more computing horsepower for quite a bit of time, and yet the technology has not existed that enables them to do some of the computational methods that they want to try. GPU computing is really going to help address that.  I frankly think that the combination between the CPU and a GPU with GPU computing capabilities will really create a new class of workstations -- one not necessarily for design but one for computation. It is almost like a personal super-computer that the researchers and the scientists will get to leverage.  This is absolutely a new class of computing and it is a new initiative for us, and our early response from the people we have spoken to, and many of them in the financial industry, are just incredibly enthusiastic, so we are very excited about it. \nArnab Chanda - Lehman Brothers: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Naser Iqbal with Salman Partners. \nNaser Iqbal - Salman Partners : Hi, guys. Marv, just really a clarification on the impact of Portal, and if I heard you correctly, that in terms of the R&D and expenses, you had a $5 million hit, a $4 million hit but a net income contribution of about $1 million. Were there any revenues for the quarter? \nMarvin D. Burkett: The revenue in Q4 was roughly $1 million, so there was roughly $5 million worth of expenses and $1 million worth of revenue.  When you look into Q1, we are looking at something slightly less than $10 million in revenue and approximately $15 million in expenses. \nNaser Iqbal - Salman Partners : Right, which is my follow-up, in terms of when you talked about the outlook for the quarter, that you expected that $10 million to come from Portal; but did I hear you correctly that you think your overall op-ex could be flat quarter on quarter? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, we think that we can, you know, obviously we had the one-time cost in Q4 for the restatement and there are some other one-time costs in Q4. I think we are very cost-conscious right now and the company does a very good job of responding to those circumstances, so I think we have a very good chance of holding op-ex flat, even though we are going to have to absorb the $10 million increase in the PortalPlayer. \nNaser Iqbal - Salman Partners : Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. \nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi, guys, also a clarification on the guidance. Was the 5% seasonal decline, was that a comment just on the PC-facing segments of your business or was that for your overall revenue expectations? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Simona, I think it was more overall, but I would classify that we expect memory to decline, and that would be probably in my view the single largest component of that 5%. But if you had to pick a point estimate, we are saying overall revenue declined 5%. \nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Terrific, and then secondly, Marv or Jen-Hsun, can you comment on how you see your channel inventories right now, both for graphics cards and also motherboards? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Channel sell-through is picking up. Q3 and Q4 were a bit choppier than -- and I think all of you guys saw that -- a bit choppier than we all expected. I think some of that had to do with AM2 gap out in the channel, but AM2s are back and there are plenty of Conroes as well, and both of those CPUs are really wonderful CPUs. When they are available in the channel, it really helps our GPU business.  We are seeing business sell-through certainly very quite brisk right now. \nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that is very helpful. As far as the actual build-up though of motherboards in the channel, is that now done and over with now that the CPUs are available? Or do we still have a bit of back-up that maybe takes a couple more weeks to get through? \nJen-Hsun Huang: It depends on what segments we are talking about. Our Intel motherboards, for example, are still ramping and we are still doing quite well with our Intel motherboard business.  I have not really checked on the AMD side of it, but now that the CPUs are back, and quite a few CPUs were taken out of the channel, as you know, so the return of the CPUs is really, really a good thing for all of us. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then just a last quick one for me, if I could: on the gross margin improvement, which was very nice in the first quarter, can you can just comment on the various puts and takes within that? In other words, I know ATI, or AMD now, had commented on a tough [inaudible] environment. It did not seem to have affected you guys, given your positioning, so that is just one aspect I wanted to see if you could comment on.  Secondly, on the TSMC pricing, which seems to have been favorable in the quarter, is that a quantifiable benefit to your margins in the quarter? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Let me start. In the GPU business, we improved gross margins quarter to quarter. Some of that improvement came from the fact that the workstation business grew very nicely during the quarter, so we benefited in the GPU business because of that.  MCPs, they improved the gross margin and the revenue increase. There is just a continued focus there on improving gross margins. Handheld improved gross margins, even though revenue was relatively flat. Memory went up during the quarter, which would have had a drag on gross margins.  I would say that each of the business units contributed to gross margin improvement. The increase in memory was a slight drag on it.  The TSMC issue, I do not know if you want to comment, Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: It is nothing special. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, I do not think there was anything out of the ordinary. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wu with Global Crown Capital. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yes, Marv, on the subject of gross margin, can you talk about or remind us of what your gross margin target, the new level is, since 44% is no longer an issue anymore and 45% looks like within reach?  And I have a question for Jen-Hsun on the PortalPlayer application processor. What is the difference between their application processor and a whole ream of these ARM-based application processors out there?  Can you also comment on the likelihood you are going to see some competition from the X-86 in the form of these, what they call the ultra mobile PCs? \nMarvin D. Burkett: I will start with the gross margin, David. Jen-Hsun established the target of a 45% gross margin just about a year ago and I think there were a lot of skeptics out there -- maybe even me, who knows -- but we have made a lot of progress and things have gone well.  I think that we are going to have to sit down and establish a new goal because yes, I agree: 45% is achievable. Now the question is, we cannot let up. We can improve gross margins from the [inaudible]. \n David Wu - Global Crown Capital: But at this point, you will not, you cannot elaborate what that might be? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, our public target is still 45%. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Okay. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the application processor for that PortalPlayer and what is different from all these other ARM-based application processors out there? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. First of all, PortalPlayer's focus has always been in the personal media player market, and in that marketplace, the digital media processing is really important. Extreme low-power is extremely important.  If you get a chance to see the new 6100, and see it do decoding [VJ] resolution video and watch it do it at just barely, barely a sweat, it is really, really amazing. So their focus is building a complete computer on a chip that is capable of doing multimedia processing at extremely low-power levels. That is really where their focus was.  Relative to us, the reason why PortalPlayer is so valuable to us is because we do not have an application processor, but we do have a very deep investment in GPU technologies over the years and the combination of our graphics and video and image processing capabilities in combination with their application processor really gives us a unique position in the marketplace.  I would say their positioning in the mobile marketplace was good but challenging because of the amount of R&D they could really invest, and our positioning was good in the high-end markets, where the flagship phones really needed the multimedia capabilities we brought.  In combination, now we can build some SOCs that are absolutely amazing, and that is the reason our two management teams decided to combine the companies. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Who do you see as competitors in that space, besides Texas Instruments? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say TI is a competitor. Obviously Samsung is a competitor. Samsung has been very successful there. The XScale business that Intel sold to Marvell -- these are all competitors in the marketplace.  But this is also one of the largest markets that we know of in the semiconductor industry and there are a whole lot of segments. Some of those segments just want your basic, best microprocessor. Some of those segments want the lowest, lowest cost SOC for your basic smartphone, and some of them need rich graphics and rich multimedia for consumer applications where you want to have your phone also be your e-mail device and music player and video player and such. That is where I think NVIDIA would really shine. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with AmTech Research. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: Good afternoon, guys. A quick question for you, Jen-Hsun, if you could talk about -- you have taken quite a bit of share in several of the markets now from your closest competitor that was acquired by AMD. Can you talk about what you think might be their response, and if there is anything that you can do to offset it or continue the track record that you have put up? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, that is a really good question and I hope I do not answer it -- not publicly, anyhow, so please do not encourage me.  You know what I would say is that our market share is in fact, although improving year over year, I think we came out of the year last year at about 18%, 19% overall graphics market share. We are at 29%. As far as I am concerned, whether it is a discrete GPU or a motherboard GPU, they are both GPUs. We believe that there are segments of the marketplace that really prefer to have a better GPU than not.  Our GPU brand, the GeForce brand, is just so strong that I think we still have a lot of opportunities. Now we are the only GPU company in the world that is completely focused, number one, but also participates in building and selling GPUs into both microprocessor markets, both the AMD market as well as the Intel market. We are the distinguishing brand of both platforms. I am excited about that.  Our job is to grow our overall GPU business from 29% to something much higher than that. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: All right. If I could, Marv, turn to you for a quick second, and I guess Jen-Hsun also plays a role in this: what is your view on the share buy-back? What should we be thinking about on the stock dilution level? Clearly this quarter the share count came in very close to unchanged. Any guidance you can offer on what we should think about going forward? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes, we evaluate it every quarter. We still have authorization from the Board to do stock buy-backs. I probably do not see any reason to deviate from our practices in the current environment, but we evaluate it every quarter.  Totally separate from that, the annual dilution level on what I call a gross basis, meaning how many shares we issue, is established by the comp committee, and so we have been bringing that down for several years now. It was roughly 3% last year -- that is excluding stock buy-backs -- and I think it will be less than that in fiscal year '08, but that is exclusive of any buy-backs. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with JP Morgan. \nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. On the chipset business, can you give us a quick update on what the mix is in terms of units and/or revenues on Intel versus AMD chipsets? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say that today it is vastly, it is mostly, by far AMD, and we had just entered the Intel chipset marketplace with the 680i I guess late Q3. We did well in Q3, we ramped more in Q4 and we are expecting to ramp even more in Q1 and ramp it into Q2. As Conroe continues to grow into the marketplace, we expect our 680i family to follow that.  I also think that is our core Intel chipset product right now and hopefully in the near future, we will try to add something to that with our motherboard GPUs for the Intel processor. \nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: I see. And then, for your overall GPU business in Q4, can you tell us what your units and ASPs did sequentially? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Overall, units were very, very, very slightly up and ASP was very slightly down. I indicated that in my comments, that the desktop ASP declined slightly in the quarter. \nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: Okay, and then Marv, can you give us some guidance on your effective tax rate for the full year fiscal '08? \nMarvin D. Burkett: Our best guess right now is 14% for both GAAP and non-GAAP, but we will evaluate that as we go through the year. We get the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which we got a full year's worth in the fourth quarter, and that is one of the drivers in being able to reduce the tax rate down to 14% for this year. \nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: That makes sense. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you. Our goal is to be one of the most influential and respected technology companies in the world by being the premier supplier of visual computing technologies and solutions. We believe the programmable GPU is becoming one of the most important technologies of the digital era, as it powers multimedia rich applications on a growing number of consumer devices. As the only GPU company in the world, we have dedicated ourselves to making this vision a reality.  Fiscal 2007 was a milestone year for NVIDIA. Because of the number of growth and technology initiatives that we have set in motion last year, we believe we are well-positioned to have another strong year.  Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting on our progress for Q1. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Good afternoon and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third fiscal quarter ended October 29, 2006. On the call today for NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marv Burkett, NVIDIA's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin today's call I would like to take care of some general administrative items. Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today's call. During this call we will discuss some non-GAAP measures about net income, net income per share and gross margin and other line items from our consolidated statements of income when talking about our results. You can find a full reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our financial release, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.nvidia.com. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. Also shareholders can listen to a live webcast of today's call and view our financial release at the NVIDIA Investors Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the company's conference call to discuss its financial results for its fourth quarter fiscal 2007. During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Forward-looking statements, including statements as to our fourth quarter 2007 outlook, a review of the stock option practices by our audit committee, the restatement, the use of non-GAAP measures, the benefits and impact of the acquisition of PortalPlayer, new and forthcoming products, our products and technologies, growth drivers, market share, Windows Vista, PlayStation 3, design wins, strategic focus, and customers and partners pertain to future events, and are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from results discussed in any forward-looking statements.

Consistent with the requirements under Regulation FD, we will be providing public guidance directly in the conference call and will be unable to provide significantly more information in off-line conversations or during the quarter, therefore questions around our financial expectations should be asked during this call. At the end of our remarks, there will be time for your questions. In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response we will allow one follow-up question. As previously announced in June 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of NVIDIA began a review of the company's stock option practices based on results of an interim review voluntarily undertaken by management. The Audit Committee's review covered the time from the company's initial public offering in 1999 to the current fiscal year, and as previously disclosed, found instances of the use of incorrect measurement base for certain option grants. The Audit Committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts. At this time, the Audit Committee has completed its forensic review of the option grants, is now working with the company's management to finalize the financial impact of using incorrect measurement dates. NVIDIA will publish the balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter and the statement of income for the nine months ended October 29, 2006, as well as restated statements of income for the comparable periods of fiscal 2006 as soon as practical upon completion of the Audit Committee's review. The company's current and former independent registered public accounting firms have not completed their review of the findings of the Audit Committee. Our financial results for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2007 are not audited and may change as a result of the ongoing Audit Committee review. The stock option practices under review and related matters can also lead to the potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including litigation or action by the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or other regulatory agencies. I'll now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, we are pleased to report record revenue of $820.6 million for our third quarter. This is our third consecutive record quarter. Year-over-year, third quarter revenue grew nearly 41%. Our growth was driven by strong performance and share gains from numerous product groups -- desktop GPU, notebook GPU and MCP, resulting in record revenue for the quarter that is well above normal seasonal patterns. Let me review the highlights and achievements for each of our business units during the quarter. Our desktop GPU business continued to deliver strong results in Q3. In addition to the seasonal strength of the PC market, we increased our desktop GPU share 5 points to 56%. GeForce achieved 89% share of the performance segment. Our desktop GPU revenue grew 13% year-over-year. With over 265 media awards worldwide in Q3, demand for our GeForce 7 series GPU remained very strong, even as we launch our next generation GPU. Yesterday, we announced GeForce 8800 to the world. Held in secrecy for four years and code-named G80, this is the most ambitious undertaking in our history. G80 is the product of hundreds of the world's best engineers, over 1,000 man years of effort, and over $400 million to develop. G80 is a revolutionary architecture and a completely ground up design. This is only the third fundamentally new architecture in our 13-year history. The last fundamentally new architecture was GeForce 256, the now famous GeForce introduced in 1999. G80 is based on a unified shader architecture. Instead of a separate vertex and pixel shading processors, G80 has 128 stream processors operating at 1.35 gigahertz that can process either vertex or pixel shaded programs. With a unified architecture, G80 can adapt its vast computational resources to the changing vertex or pixel shading workload from team to team. G80 is the world's first DX10 GPU. DX10 is a major new API for Microsoft Windows Vista, and includes many new important features. One of the most exciting DX10 and G80 features is the geometry shader. By programming the unified shader processes of G80, designers can programmatically create, destroy and manipulate geometric mesh. Game designers can do amazing things like procedural geometry to programmatically generate landscapes, particle systems to create realistic looking smoke and clouds, displacement maps to create incredibly high geometric modality, fast environment mapping, and even motion blur. Yesterday, we also announced CUDA, a new mode of operation on GPUs where the massive computational power of the GPU can be utilized for computation intensive applications. We envision CUDA enabling PCs to solve problems traditionally solved on supercomputers and custom ASICs. This breakthrough architecture is complemented by another first, the NVIDIA C-compiler for GPUs. We envision CUDA will open a whole new field called GPU computing, providing for engineers and scientists and digital content creators tools they need to solve computation intense problems. The performance of GeForce 8800 is simply awesome. A single 8800 GTX is twice the performance of our 7950 GTX, our previous flagship GPU. In fact, 8800 GTX is faster than two 7950 GTX and SLI. GeForce 8800 GTX is also a breakthrough in power efficiency. Although 8800 GTX has twice the performance and tons more features, the power is just a bit higher than 7950 GTX. Its on architectural efficiency and low-power design has really paid off. The GeForce 8 architecture is twice the performance per watt of GeForce 7. The most exciting news about GeForce 8800 is that it is available in stores now, and will soon be shipping from nearly every PC supplier around the world. Our notebook GPU business achieved a major milestone in Q3. We achieved record revenue for the third consecutive quarter, and grew shares at 52%, and became the number one notebook GPU supplier for the first time in our history. Our notebook GPU revenue grew 47% -- 46% quarter-over-quarter and over 100% year-over-year. We expect our share gain to continue through the year, and then accelerate as we ship design wins based on Intel's Santa Rosa platform. The nForce MCP product line achieved record revenue for its eighth consecutive quarter. The MCP business doubled in revenue from the same quarter of last year, and grew 33% sequentially from Q2. Market Research now ranks NVIDIA the second largest PC core logic supplier with 17% of the total volumes and 61% of all AMD core logic. Our AMD share grew 9 points and our overall share grew 5 points. Our MCP growth was driven in part by the increased adoption of our nForce notebook solutions by large PC manufacturers, including HP, Acer, Fujitsu Siemens and Gateway. OEMs have embraced our unique strategy of offering single chip MCP designed specifically to reduce space and power consumption. This week we were also pleased to have announced Dell shipping nForce products in their new AMD-based OptiPlex 740 commercial PC. These new Dell OptiPlex products are specifically offered to large corporations who demand the highest quality platforms deployed with stable software drivers designed to lower support costs. One of the major reasons Dell selected nForce was the high level of quality of our NVIDIA stable image software drivers that we developed as part of our NVIDIA business platform. NVIDIA business platform, or NBP, is the platform level commercial PC solution we introduced last year for smaller PC manufacturers, and have been adopted by over 100 companies in North America, Europe and Asia. This week we are extending our nForce products for Intel CPUs with the announcement of what many customers claim to be the best performance platform for Intel's Core2 Duo, and new Core2 Quad CPUs. Our new NVIDIA nForce 680i SLI MCP delivered top performance in Intel CPUs and are designed specifically for enthusiasts with features such as SLI, DualNet gigabit Ethernet and MediaShield RAID. A particularly exciting feature of nForce 680 SLI is its ability to allow the most enthusiastic of PC customers to over clock their CPUs, which offer the users the benefit of tapping into additional CPU performance. These new nForce 680i SLI products are immediately available from etailers and retailers. NVIDIA's Quadro professional business had another sequential strong quarter with shipments up nearly 25% year-over-year. Our professional business continues to be strong in all segments, particularly with new notebook workstation design wins with HP, and shipments for high-end workstation solutions and system products. In August at SIGGRAPH, we launched NVIDIA Quadro Plex, an entirely new category of professional digital computing solutions. Any SLI ready server or workstation can now support two external Quadro Plexes to build an 8 GPU graphic supercomputer solution. And when clustered, able to offer up to 25 times more graphics compute density than traditional data center solutions. We began volume shipments of Quadro Plex in September. Acceptance is strong in key markets like simulation, medical, styling design and oil and gas. It enables thousands of engineers and designers to experience advanced personal visualization solutions previously only accessible in large visualization centers. We also unveiled a new version of our Gelato 2.1 final frame film quality rendering software, which includes next generation features such as texture baking, enhanced raytracing performance, and improved lightening functionality for 3D rendering. To date, we have surpassed 70,000 downloads of Gelato. We anticipate putting this technology in the hands of many users will usher in a wave of new, high-quality rendered content. Our handheld GPU business achieved another record -- another strong quarter. We saw continued demand for DVB-H services, even after the initial demand generated by the World Cup. Our flagship DVB-H design wins, the Samsung P910 and P920 handsets have been adopted for further trials in Sweden and in South Africa. The launch of the first North American rollout of DVB-H services have been publicly confirmed by Crown Castle, who will launch the Modeo mobile TV services in New York City before the end of the calendar year. The HTC manufactured Modeo phone is powered by the NVIDIA GoForce 5500 GPU. During the quarter, we began shipping our first North American market phone, the iconic Motorola RAZR V3xx. Our handheld GPU will also power the upcoming Motorola RAZR MAXX, targeted at the international market. As you can see, NVIDIA has become far more than a PC graphics chip company. We are passionately focused on being the world's premier provider of visual computing solutions, whether it is on PCs or consoles, the most powerful image generators to miniaturized mobile devices. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. I will return in a moment to highlight our growth opportunities.\nMarv Burkett: Thanks Jen-Hsun. Today, we are reporting GAAP and non-GAAP P&Ls for both Q2 and Q3, as we do not believe the restatement that is in progress will have a material impact on our current fiscal 2007 P&Ls. We will not be able to report a balance sheet until the restatement is completed, although we will comment on select balance sheet items that we do not believe will be impacted by the restatement. I'm going to focus most my comments on Q3 results, but we have included both GAAP and non-GAAP P&L for Q2 as well. GAAP results for the three months ended October 29, 2006 show revenue of $820.6 million and net income of $106.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares to revenue of $687.5 million in Q2 and net income of $86.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. The non-GAAP statement for Q3 removes non-recurring expenses of $42.6 million net of tax, which is comprised primarily of stock compensation expense, plus a one-time charge associated with the confidential patent licensing arrangement. This results in a non-GAAP P&L net income of $149 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Revenue for the third quarter, as I said, was $820.6 million. The quarter-to-quarter growth in revenue of approximately $130 million or 19% was composed of several business units which grew significantly. Year-to-year growth for Q3 was 41%. Desktop GPU grew $49 million quarter-to-quarter with most of that growth in the mainstream and performance segments. ASPs held flat in all segments. We had initial shipments of GeForce 8800, but it was not a big impact to revenue. Growth in GeForce 7 Series products accounted for almost all of the $49 million. As Jen-Hsun noted, notebook grew 46% quarter to quarter, and is now more than $80 million in revenue per quarter. All of this growth is in GeForce 7 series products. MCP continued its string of record quarters, and also grew by $48 million quarter-to-quarter, and is up by more than 100% year-to-year. Both professional solutions and handheld GPUs were slightly down in the quarter. Memory grew by $20 million quarter-to-quarter, and was slightly more than $50 million. Consumer electronics was relatively flat quarter-to-quarter, but we recognized our first royalties for PlayStation 3, even though it was at a very low level. On the gross margin side, GAAP gross margin was 40.7% in the quarter, including the one-time charge associated with licensing certain patents and the stock compensation expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 42.9%. The gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by the higher growth in the lower margin businesses, such as memory, mainstream, desktop GPUs and MCP. Each of the individual business unit continues to make progress in improving gross margins, but the overall margins were affected by the mix. The revenue increase in memory alone would account for almost a full percentage point reduction in gross margin. So despite what might appear to be relatively flat margins, we believe we are continuing to make progress in improving gross margins. I will only be able to comment on selected items on the balance sheet until the restatement is completed. We do not believe these items will be affected by the restatement. Cash at the end of the quarter was $1.174 billion, up more than $300 million quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, this is led by profits, but we also decreased both receivables and inventory. Accounts receivable were down by $20 million, and inventory was down by $5 million. Receivables now stand at $439 million and DSO for the quarter is at 49 days, which is down from 60 days in the prior quarter. Inventory was at $373 million and days sales in inventory were at 70 compared to 87 in the prior quarter. There was no stock repurchases during the quarter. Headcount at the end of the quarter stood at 3,627, which is up 200 from Q2. Of the 200, approximately 150 were added internationally. Year-to-year headcount is up by 1,033, of which 735 were international hires. I would like to give you an update on the restatement. We're making good progress and are receiving excellent cooperation from both PWC and KPMG. I wish I could give you a precise filing date for our restated and delinquent SEC filings, but we can't be precise at this time. We have an internal plan to complete the work before the end of the month, however, neither PWC nor KPMG has completed their work, and there are unresolved items. We're committed to re-filing as soon as possible. Now for the outlook. On the revenue side, because of our strong competitive lineup and new products, including the GeForce 8800, we expect revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter. The magnitude may be difficult to forecast, but we feel comfortable with 5% growth over Q3, even if memory declines. We expect growth in desktop GPUs, continued growth in MCP, and resumed growth in professional solutions. We expect handheld to be relatively flat and consumer electronics to be up slightly, but with increased gross margins. For gross margins, we expect continued improvement. While we may not achieve our internal goal of 45% by year end, we're comfortable with a gross margin increase of 100 basis points or more in Q4 from Q3. New products, including GeForce 8800 and the new MCP products, will help gross margin, and the incremental royalties from Sony will also be a benefit. Even though 44% gross margins might be admirable, we do not believe we're done. There are further improvements to be made and we're pursuing them. We believe that a gross margin of 45% in the near future is certainly not impossible. Operating expenses will increase in Q4 on the order of 3 to 5% as we continue to hire. We believe the tax rate will hold at 17% for GAAP and 16% for non-GAAP. We have not included any PortalPlayer revenue or expenses in this outlook. Depending on when the acquisition closes, there could be both revenue and expenses in our fourth quarter results. Now I will turn it back over to Jen-Hsun\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Marv. On Monday of this week, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire PortalPlayer, the pioneer of application processors for portable media players. Their products power many of the world's most recognized digital music players. Their processors also power the upcoming Vista SideShow, secondary display for notebooks. With this acquisition, we're combining the two essential technologies for next generation mobile devices, PortalPlayer's application processor and NVIDIA's handheld GPU. IDC predicts that the combined market for application processors and GPUs will grow to approximately $4.1 billion by 2010. Semiconductors that enable connectivity and multimedia features in handsets are expected to show the greatest growth over the next several years. We're very excited about growth opportunities for the year ahead. The reviews of our new products are fabulous. Let me give you a flavor. According to PC Perspective, and I quote, in my seven years of covering the world of PC hardware, no other graphics architecture shift has been as dramatic as the one we are seeing here today with NVIDIA's GeForce 8800 GTX. I am quoting Kyle Bennett at HardOCP, the EVGA nForce 680i motherboard is easily one of the best enthusiast motherboards I have ever used. The 680i NVIDIA reference motherboard will make it into my next system build no question asked. We expect a rapid production ramp of the new GeForce 8800 and NVIDIA nForce 680 SLI product families to drive Q4 growth. In Q4, we will also witness the launch of the most anticipated next generation video game console, the PlayStation 3. We expect our notebook GPU share increase to continue as we fully ramp our map of design wins. Our share increase should continue through the spring Santa Rosa cycle as we achieve an even higher level of success than Napa. We expect our Santa Rosa design wins to ramp in Q1. Q1 will also benefit from the continuing ramp of the 2.5G North American phone design wins in our handheld GPU business. And with the recent acquisition of AMD and -- recent combination of AMD and ATI, we are in a unique position to offer branded integrated graphics for the Intel processor market. Market demand for our product has been very high. We will respond to market demand and offer our first Intel integrated solution early next year. We expect this will significantly increase our addressable market for MCPs. Finally, we're about to experience the biggest combination of discontinuity to simultaneously impact our ecosystem in over 10 years. Next generation Microsoft DX10-based games, Vista, and high-definition DVD, each of these discontinuities by themselves significantly increase the amount of graphics processing power necessary to deliver a compelling end-user experience. As the adoption of each of these grow throughout the year and beyond, so will the need for next generation GPUs, like the nForce -- like the GeForce 8 family. It is very evident that 3D graphics and GPU is becoming an evermore essential part of our computing experience. Some of the most exciting and popular applications are enabled by 3D including Google Earth, Microsoft\u2019s new Virtual Earth 3D, Apple's iTunes 7 uses 3D to elegantly rendered album covers. With this, they are providing 3D foundation for all future applications. We expect to all of them to many more innovative ways to use 3D. This is truly a great time to be the single most focused GPU company in the world. Thank you, and we would be happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with JP Morgan.\nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: Good afternoon. Can you comment at all first off on any guidance you can give us on PortalPlayer, what you expect in terms of revenues, maybe a run rate and OpEx? And then I have a follow-up please.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess the answer is no. First of all, the deal is not done yet. We have just signed a definitive and -- so it is probably too early to do that.\nMarv Burkett: Yes, I think so, Shawn. It requires shareholder vote and we will see. We are very excited about acquiring them, but it does requires shareholder vote.\nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: Okay. Maybe turning into the PC end demand environment, you guys are obviously gaining share. Is there any color you can give us on how you see PC end demand going in as we move through Q4 actually and maybe into calendar Q1?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There is a whole lot of different dynamics that are going on. There is obviously Q4 is seasonally a large quarter. There are some concerns about this about this, but we are seeing that. Most of the PC OEMs that we work with and most of the channel are relatively comfortable with the transition at this point. Our biggest focus right now is just ramping GeForce 8800 and nForce 680. And the market demand for both products are incredibly high. And so, we're going to focus on ramping those products and that should be the focus of our growth drivers in the Q4 timeframe.\nShawn Webster - JP Morgan: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: First off, congratulations on another outstanding quarter guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Mark.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Hey, Jen-Hsun, you talked a little bit about Quadro Plex and that certainly is a whole new strategy for the company. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunities you see there, just maybe size of market and how we should think about that from a business model perspective as you go forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. First of all, Quadro Plex leverages of our SLI presence and our workstation presence and the vast amount of software that we developed over the years for workstation applications and SLI applications. Quadro Plex is an external stand-alone image generator that allows our customers to scale their rendering density by just enormous factors. The application, of course, is targeted within all of the same customer bases that historical image generators have gone into, in addition to desk side workstations that would have wanted image generator type capability, but does simply couldn't afford it. There has been several billion dollars worth of image generators that have been installed into the world over the last, I guess, decade and a half. All of those image generators still require quite a bit of maintenance. They're pretty outdated. They consume a great deal of power. And I think that replacing those over time is just going to be a really huge opportunity for us. Not to mention creating a whole new class of desk sized imaging workstations that weren't possible before. It is hard exactly for us to scope out how big the opportunities are, but it is quite significant. It is certainly several times larger than the workstation business it is today. And in combination with the GPU computing technology that we recently -- that we announced yesterday called CUDA, we think that these desk side image generators, or super computers by your desk, are going to be really interesting applications for us to grow into. The business model with Quadro Plex is based off of system sales. The configuration is proprietary. It is based off of SLI, and it goes with quite a large suite of software to enable scalability. And so we will sell systems through our OEMs. They're branded Quadro Plexes. We would also sell it through VARs, and it is also sold directly on our website to professionals who work directly with us.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: I guess it would seem like that business would have potential to be pretty chunky over time. Would that be your expectation? And if so, would you have visibility as the, sort of, backlog begins to build for that business over time?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our expectation is that it is going to be a very large business. I don't know exactly how large it is going to be yet. But I agree with you. It is going to be very chunky business. It should be a very significant business. The number of installation of image generators in the world, just thinking through that, large workstation companies use to -- multibillion dollar workstation companies use to serve that market. And so we're going to replace those aging image generators. We're going to create new categories of desk-sized super workstations. And then in combination with GPU computing, I think it is a whole new computing model that we are excited about. It is hard for us to guess exactly what it is right now, but I think it is going to be very large, Mark.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Then just one last question on memory. As you were ramping up the G80 family here over the next couple of quarters, should we see memory going up, or do you think it can hold here at current levels?\nMarv Burkett: I guess my feeling is that we hope it is down in Q4. That is our current expectation. We had to ramp up for the 8800 launch, but we don't anticipate that that goes up.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks a lot. Nice job guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Mark\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst.\nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Thanks for taking the question. Just not looking for guidance on the PortalPlayer revenues, but just thinking about the opportunity there, how quickly could you realistically integrate your video graphics processing capabilities with their on-base SOCs? And then what are you thinking is the best opportunity there? Is it still where they have been focused on the stand-alone media players, or do you think it is the mobile phones? Secondly on that, how serious do you think OEMs are about adopting the SideShow technology?\nJen-Hsun Huang: So, what I'm going to do is I am going to answer the question probably from a more strategic perspective. And the reason for that is because the deal is just not done. And any speculation about our businesses -- about their business and our combination of the business is just a little too premature. But I think if you look at it strategically we feel that future mobile devices will become more and more intelligent, would incorporate operating systems, will be multitasking, will support all kinds of rich media. And over the course of certainly by within the next ten years, these mobile devices are going to become amazing little portable computers that allows you to do everything that you can imagine a digital device to be able to do today, whether it is music or movies or television or Web viewing or 3D games, or whatever happens to be. And certainly well within the next ten years, this dynamic will happen, and these portable devices will become your most personal computer. And we expect that this is going to be when it all -- when these various dynamics come together, particularly as the rich operating system becomes available for these mobile devices, it is really going to become the second PC revolution and so we are excited from that perspective. The two really critical ingredients to enable this new era to happen is application processors in combination with GPUs. The baseband processor is innovating quite nicely. And I think that the technology is maturing, and the capability is certainly available on every single phone already, obviously. So where we need to innovate is application processors and GPUs, and that is reason why we are so excited about the PortalPlayer opportunity. How excited are people about SideShow? I believe they have a numerous number of design wins, and they are real OEMs, and they really, really, really going to ship with it. And the way I think about it is the utility to the end-user. How many of us frequently carry our notebooks around, and just want to quickly glance at the calendar or the time or send a very quick message or see a quick message? I think that all of us would like to do that. And so without having to boot-up and log in to your personal computer. And so I think this is a capability that is a real differentiator for the notebook. And if a cell phone has two displays and some of them have three displays, why shouldn't a notebook have a couple of two, three displays?\nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Great. That is helpful color. And then just a follow-up to your new platform launch and your comments on GPU-based computing. Earlier this year at NAB, Sony and IBM showed off a prototype cell-based media server for the broadcasting industry, as video is recently going digital and not tape-based. Is that an area that since you would be computing with that platform on, or would you have GPU-based media servers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It is too early to tell whether we're going to compete or not. But I think is interesting is that there's a whole new area of computing that is just not well served today. Some people think that supercomputers ought to serve it. We all know that over the course of the last ten years there has been a drought of supercomputer technology. And the reason for that, of course, is it has been really the workstation and the PC era. Now the world knows that there is a -- we have a supercomputer crisis, if you will, that there are so many problems that are very, very data intensive, very computer intensive, but the innovation and the investment around supercomputers has really lagged over the years. We think that we can transform the PC into a supercomputer. This is a wonderful opportunity for all the entire PC ecosystem. And by adding a GPU with a technology like CUDA, we can turn the PC, with the addition of GPU computing, into a deskside supercomputer. You could do this obviously in a server configuration as well with a bunch of blades. And the applications for these are wherever all these supercomputers are required and where people are using FPGAs potentially, or even designing custom ASICs to do the intensive number crunching. So, I think this is going to be opening up a whole new era of new style of computing, and we call that GPU computing.\nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Great. It sounds exciting. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with AmTech Research.\nDoug Freedman - AmTech Research: A quick one for you. Can you give us a little bit more color on the chipset business and what you're doing there to improve the gross margins? And where do you think you can take those gross margins over the longer term? If you could just describe the landscape of the chipset market that I think is changing quite a bit recently.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think gross margins could be achieved -- could be improved in a lot of variety of ways. The number one best way is architectural. And I probably prefer to keep them as trade secrets, but architectural efficiency, doing more with less or doing more through extreme high integrations, or whatever the technology is -- approach is very important, so architectural. The second thing is operational. We have to make sure that the products are built just in time to benefit from the lowest wafer cost. We have to make sure that the yields are as high as we can make it. The scraps are low as we can make it, and the quality as high as we can. People have always known that through perfect quality is your best way to improve profitability. And the rest of it, the market dictates. We don't set the price; the competition and the customers set the price. And so on our side have to make sure we develop products that the market really highly desires. And that is one of the advantages of nForce. Our brand, our nForce brand is really becoming, if not already, the number one brand of core logic. If you're somebody who cares about the performance and stability and the availability of the best technology on a motherboard, nForce is really your choice. And I think we have demonstrated that on both the Intel as well as the AMD platforms. Between the combination of great architecture, efficient architecture, operational excellence, and building brands that the market highly desires those are basically our approach. And we hammer on all three every day.\nDoug Freedman - AmTech Research: What do you see as the price trend in that marketplace? And then if you could give us an idea of when we can -- when you believe you'll see revenue from the Intel integrated solution?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The pricing trend in core logic -- I don't know if there's a particular trend -- it depends on what products and what segments we launch at any given point in time. This quarter, we are launching our nForce 680i and the 680a, and both of them are targeted at the enthusiast market. They tend to have higher ASPs and so -- because we're ramping those products there's probably a good likelihood that we trend upward. It has a lot to do with what we introduce more than what is happening in the marketplace. With respect to the Intel chipset, my expectation is that we -- I guess the market's expectation, which is customers would like us to be in the marketplace by spring of next year, and we are working as hard as we can to do that.\nDoug Freedman - AmTech Research: All right. Great. Thank you so much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Doug.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayyib Shah with Longbow Research.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Hi guys. Congratulations on the quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: In the past you guys have kind of restricted yourself to the high end of the Intel platform MCP market. Now you're talking about significantly expanding your footprint there. Can you maybe talk about do you see yourself going after the mainstream Intel MCP segment in a major way in 2007? And if so, how much of that changed approach was because of the AMD ATI merger?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The answer to your question is yes. We're going to go after the mainstream part of the market with our GeForce and nForce branded integrated graphics. And that market is obviously very, very large. And the opportunity to us is now quite significant, and the reason for that is directly related to ATI being sold to AMD. Now there is really a void of a branded, integrated graphics supplier in the Intel market, and that is an opportunity that we have stayed away from because there were other players that were serving that market before. But now with DX10 and high-definition and Blu-ray video and Vista, the bar for graphics capability has gone up so high in just one year's time we believe that that raised bar, as well as the fact that there is now a vacuum because ATI has left that market, it is just a wonderful opportunity for us. This is just the perfect time for us to enter it.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Okay .Then can you talk about the supply situation for graphics memory? How do you see that shaping up over the next quarter? And if Marv can put this in the context of gross margins, have you had to absorb some of our memory cost increase in the last quarter?\nMarv Burkett: What was that last portion? I didn't hear that.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Have you had to absorb some of the memory cost increase in the fiscal third quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess the first thing is the comment about the memory shortage. There is a memory shortage, or memory tightness. But the memory tightness is by and large alleviated at this point. But during the tightness we worked really closely with all of our add-in card partners and OEMs. And because we're such a close partner of all the memory suppliers, we have been helpful at helping them secure the memories that they needed in a price that was fair to the marketplace. We were frankly very, very helpful to the graphics ecosystem to help them secure memories during Q3. But I think the shortage is by and large stabilized at this point.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Thank you\nMarv Burkett: On the comment with regard to gross margins, obviously our gross margins were impacted by the increase in memory last quarter. If you look at it very, very simplistically, a $20 million increase in memory business which we had Q2 to Q3, if you had gotten 40% margin on that, that is $8 million. That is a full percentage point in gross margin. Now that is not quite what happened, we do get some margin off of memory. To answer your other portion of the question, no, we don't lose money on memory, but it is just not a high margin business.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Tayyib. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pranay Laharia with Deutsche Bank.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: A question on die size. So your G80 die size looks to be a lot larger than your G70 and it appears likely that in this new generation you'll lose the die size advantage that you guys had over your competition last time around. Can you talk about what gross margin impact these two factors will have?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, I guess I all answer the second question first. This time around the competition hasn't even shown their products yet. I guess at this point their die size would be infinitely large, and so I would say that we have -- we still have a competitive advantage relative to that. The die size is larger, but the ASP is also higher, and so you have to balance those two things. You know GeForce 7900 is now well into the $299 segment. And I have seen some prices down that are even below that. But that is not where GeForce 8800 is positioned right now. The GeForce 8800 is positioned at the enthusiast segment and the very high-performance segment where either the gamer or the enthusiast demands to have the absolute best, and has a real need to run games at extreme high resolutions and the most modern games. We have repositioned the 7900 starting last quarter into the lower parts of the performance segment, and it is now solidly there, and it is doing fabulously. And so the two products are simply positioned at different price points in different parts of the marketplace.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Let me just sort of follow-up on that. Do you think when your G80 line ramps up across the stack on a full stack for full stack comparison, will you be the same die size as you were with G70 or will you be higher? Thinking logically that ought to dictate your gross margins for the next one year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: That is a good question. G80 is just the first of the G8X family. And there are many other G8X families, probably nine others. We're going to -- all the numbers in between. So the GPU is designed to be scalable in architecture. And our engineers are very, very rapidly and very hard at work in building all kinds of products derived from the G8X family.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then just one last question. For the Santa Rosa platform, do you compete with G70 or with G80 derivatives? And where do you think your product -- where do you think your market share goes in notebook discrete graphics with Santa Rosa?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Santa Rosa notebooks are DX10 notebooks. They are Vista, DX10, Blu-ray disk, high-definition video notebooks. And we are the only supplier of DX10 GPUs today, and the only one sampling notebook GPUs. And my expectation is that we -- our success on the Santa Rosa transition should be quite a bit higher than our success even with Napa.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yup.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with CIBC World Markets.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Good afternoon guys. Congratulations. This is actually Dan Morris calling for Rick.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Dan.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: The first question. Your guidance for the consumer division sits slightly up. I might have expected that to be a little bit higher. It is something going on with maybe the NREs and the levels that you're getting there, if you could give an update there?\nMarv Burkett: Yes. The NREs are rolling off. And until we have other programs that replace them, we don't anticipate but we're anticipating that they roll off, so you will see a decline in NRE, offset by the increase in royalties.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: How is the NRE recognized and about how much was left?\nMarv Burkett: A small amount is left, and it is recognized on a percentage of completion basis.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Good.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Or if I can just add to that. They are ongoing projects on a NRE basis. It is just that it is recognized on a completion basis, and some of the projects that we're currently working on right now are further away from completion, but we're working on those projects.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\nPeter Karzaris - Citigroup: This is [Peter Karzaris] for Glen Yeung. You put up a good quarter. I'm just curious actually for your inventory it looks like it is down a bit quarter on quarter. You have the new product launch and you have been seeing some substantial share gain. What is your ability to I guess service potential upside for next quarter if you had to? And I have something to follow that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: All first of all, I think we actually -- we're actually as passionate as you guys are in reducing our inventories, and still be able to run our business. I know what you are saying is true too. Having inventory allows you to address unexpected demand. But what we're trying to do operationally is to put ourselves in a position where we can continue to address unexpected demand but work down our inventory. That is an intense focus in our company, and our expectation and our goal is to reduce our inventory even further, and yet still be able to address unexpected demands.\nPeter Karzaris - Citigroup: So, let me ask just a little differently.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess maybe our -- let me just say just one more thing. It is reduced not by accident. And it didn't reduce unexpectedly. And we hope that it in fact goes down even further in the future. That is our hope. That is our goal.\nPeter Karzaris - Citigroup: I guess -- let me ask a slightly different way. It looks like this quarter one of places you had upside was in mainstream. You had new products out there. Can you give me a sense of the mix of your inventory and how it has changed?\nMarv Burkett: The mix of our inventory it is waited heavily to the new product. And so are we going to be in perfect mix? Probably not, never happen. But we think we are in good shape from an inventory standpoint to support upside.\nPeter Karzaris - Citigroup: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest: Thank you. Jen-Hsun, if we looked maybe a little bit longer out to next year and looked at the growth drivers kind of from a product segment, what do you -- it sounds like notebooks are only going to be getting better next year with Santa Rosa. Should we be looking at notebook chipsets as being on a year-over-year basis probably the two major product drivers next year, or can we lump wireless in there as well?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see, what did should grow next year. I think GPUs will grow next year because Vista, high def, DX10, they are just amazing, amazing things happening in our PC industry. I haven't felt this excited about all the new technologies coming since Windows 95. And Windows 95 was big, big, as you recall. I think that is going to happen next year. Our handheld business should continue to grow substantially. In fact it should accelerate its growth next year because of our entry into 2.5G. I think our chipset business is going to grow. And the reason for that is partly because of the dynamics I have explained already about Vista and DX10. Vista, DX10 and high def have just raised the bar so that second-tier core logic suppliers are going to have a much, much harder time competing in the future. And they either would have had to invest already hundreds of millions of dollars to get here with DX10 or they are just not going to be able to compete next year. I think our core logic business would do very well. I also think that our serviceable market is going to grow dramatically with the branded Intel core logic business. I think that is going to be big for us. I can't help but believe that Sony is going to incredibly well next year. The early reviews are already really very exciting and so --. And then workstations. Frankly, my psychology right now is that we are in a position to grow all of our businesses next year. And we have strategies to grow all of our businesses next year. And we have reason to believe that the market dynamics will allow us to grow every single one of our businesses next year.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest: If we look at the desktop GPU business, you have obviously got a pretty significant head start here with the G80 architecture relative to the competition. You had stated in your prepared remarks that you have 89% share in performance segment. Your share relatively in the mainstream segment below that level. So with this head start do we have an opportunity to take some share in that segment relative to the competition as well next year, given the head start?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That is a good point. We are certainly still focused on increasing share. We are also focused on increasing revenue [TAM]. I want to continue to emphasize that we -- although we enjoyed talking about share and we enjoy gaining share, one of the focus of our company has always been is creating a larger market for all of us to share, and SLI certainly created a larger TAM. The introduction of DX10 will increase the revenue TAM hopefully because DX10 is so exciting and Vista is so exciting and high-definition video is so exciting it might drive the ASP up. People are looking for more GPU experience, more GPU performance to get the best experience. That will increase the TAM. And so we look for ways to increase the unit attached. We look for ways to help consumers experience better content, and those things always increase TAMs. But we're still very hyper focused in increasing share.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest: Thank you. That was very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devan Moodley with Scotia Capital.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Hi guys, great quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: And you guys almost delivered a Q3 that is kind of what the Street was expecting for next year. In that context, obviously things are going pretty well ahead of expectations. What have you done to secure the wafer capacity you think you're going to need? Clearly that has changed from even two quarters ago.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are being one of the largest, and I think we probably are at this point from wafer consumption perspective, the largest in the world, and having such close relationships with TSMC, our single largest foundry partner, and others, I think that really plays a role in this. We have a rigorous forward-looking and forward planning process. Internally we have expected to be here for some time to be honest, and so it didn't happen accidentally. We expected to be here, and so we have been planning for that. And we're planning for next quarter. We're planning for next year. And our alignment with TSMC and other foundries is excellent. They have a perfect understanding of exactly what we need. And there's no evidence whatsoever that they're not going to be able to support us in every way.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Just one follow-up. If we look at a year from now, where would you like the percentage of your desktop GPU business to be in terms of the G80 family?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Marv, go ahead.\nMarv Burkett: The normal transition would put it above 50%.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Sorry, desktop and mobile?\nMarv Burkett: Yes. I don't know about mobile [heard about live], so I'm talking about desktop, that is what you asked.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Okay. Thanks guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Dennison with UBS.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: Thanks guys. Good quarter. I'm wondering if you can give me just a little bit more color on the patent license fee. I don't need to know what it is about or what it is for, but I'm not understanding how it is an one-time item. It would seem to me that it would be meaningful for gross margin if you guys had to pay patent license fees.\nMarv Burkett: I wish I can give you more information, but it is a confidential arrangement. It includes payments for use of those patents. It is a significant number of patents. Beyond that I really don't think we can comment.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: So is it something that you have used this technology for in the past, and so it didn't show up in past margins and you're putting it in this margin, or is it for the future or --?\nMarv Burkett: It is primarily for the past.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: And Jen-Hsun, I heard you say that you were getting into the Intel integrated MCP market. I also heard Marv say that MCP margins should come up. This is a notoriously tough margin business. It is Intel integrated. Can you give me a little color on how you guys expect to bring margins up in that business, particularly given the 44% range you are talking about next quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I'm not sure yet. That is kind of the truth. I don't have a product to sell yet, and so I really don't have very much experience there. But my general experience with -- and you know that gross margin improvement has been a passion of mine and our company for quite a few years now. We have been increasing it quarter by quarter by quarter, and we doing all kinds of great stuff. What I had learned about it is there's probably on balance about three major factors. One of them is your architecture. And so that relies on just the really innovative and the talented, the really creative engineers that we have to come up with innovative architecture. The second one is operational excellence. And that one just those from the front of your company all the way to the back of your company. You just have no waste whatsoever. And perfect yields, but no waste, perfect quality, if you just hit everything at 100% and everything at 0%, you're going to be -- everything else at 0%, you will be in good shape. And the last part of it is just building a great product. You need to have a great brand in this marketplace. And the market that we will serve, the market we will continue to serve is where we believe we can capture the value from the products that we sell. You know that we're not fanatical about revenues; we're fanatical about profits. We don't need to go chase profitless prosperity. We're just not going to do it. We are going to target the segments of the marketplace where our work and our brand is valued. And we will leave the other segments to other people.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: Okay. Great. Finally, I know you guys aren't offering much in the way of color on PortalPlayer, but do you expect this to be helpful or a drag on margins going forward should the deal go through?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It should be slightly dilutive in the first year. And in the second year I hope it is wonderfully accretive.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I want to thank all of you guys for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our progress for Q4. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the fiscal year 2007 third quarter financial results conference call.

At this time, the company does not expect to be in a position to file its Form 10 Q for the second fiscal quarter by September 8, 2006 following deadline, or the permitted extension to September 13, 2006.  The company is focused on resolving these issues as quickly as possible and plans to file its Form 10 Q and any required financial statements following the completion of the review. I will now hand the call over to Jen Hsun.\nJen Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019re pleased to report record revenue of $687.5 million for our second quarter. Year-over-year, second quarter revenue grew 20%.  Our growth was driven by strong performance from numerous product groups. Desktop GPU, notebook GPU, MCP, professional solutions and handheld GPU, resulting in record revenue for the second quarter, which is a seasonally slow quarter. Let me review the highlights and achievements of each of our business units during the quarter.  Our desktop GPU business delivered a strong Q2. We maintained a leading share of over 50%. Our year-on year revenue grew 13% and our market share grew 5%.  Demand for our GeForce 7600 and 7900 series GPUs with SLI continues to be strong.  NVIDIA is dedicated to delivering the highest performance and best gaming experience to PC gamers. With the launch of our revolutionary graphics card, the GeForce 7950 GX2 will once again raise the bar on PC gaming. With 7950 GX2, gamers can now enjoy the latest games at incredible resolution of 2500 x 1600. That is the resolution of cinematic film. Thirteen times the resolution of television, and brings the 16 x 9 panoramic experience of cinema to gaming. We call this next level experience extreme, high-definition gaming. It is really something to witness. The 7950 GX2 is the fastest graphics card available today. It was launched by over 28 leading enthusiast OEMs include Dell\u2019s flagship, XPS 700.  We continue to expand the SLI platform by delivering SLI-enabled GPUs from Quad SLI 7950 GX2 and down into the mainstream of our product line. We have shipped over 20 million SLI GPUs to date. The popularity of NVIDIA\u2019s SLI has been further validated by the recent publication release by Guru3D of a comprehensive review of multi GPU platforms. This review was performed by some of the most respected hardware review sites over several weeks of testing. NVIDIA\u2019s SLI platform was found to be the clear winner in performance, game capability and software stability.  In the performance segment where price performance ratio is critical, we continued to gain momentum. We fully transitioned from our highly popular GeForce 6600 to the GeForce 7600, which delivers almost 100% performance improvement at the same price point. In Q2, our performance segment shipments grew nearly 50%. We expect the GeForce 7600 will break sales records set by the 6600.  NVIDIA\u2019s focus on the stringent power, performance and video requirements of the notebook segment have delivered solid results in Q2. Our notebook GPU revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and while the notebook segment was seasonally down in Q2, our notebook GPU revenue was up 12% quarter to question. Year-over-year, two of our key notebook segments realized substantial increases in volume shipments: performance segments up 80% and mainstream segments up 172%.  During the quarter we launched SLI for high-end gaming notebooks, bringing the best of PC gaming experiences to notebooks. We also introduced PureVideo HD, the industry\u2019s only complete solution for enjoying high-definition Blue ray and HD movie experiences on PCs. PureVideo HD is a complete solution that consists of the video processor in G47, complex video processing algorithms, Blue ray disc and high-definition movie player, and content protection technologies. The G47 series with PureVideo HD powered the first HD DVD in Blue ray notebooks from Toshiba, Sony and Acer in Q2.  Overall, there were approximately 20 new notebooks launched in Q2 based on NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce 7 Series notebook GPUs. As a result, our share in the notebook GPU segment grew from 24% to 37% from the first quarter to the second quarter of calendar 2006 as reported by Mercury Research. We expect our share gains to continue as new notebooks based on GeForce 7 Series GPUs continue to ramp. Looking forward, we\u2019re excited about the upcoming launch of Microsoft\u2019s Vista operating system. Microsoft Vista will bring focus on 3 D performance to the mass market. We believe that Vista\u2019s demand on 3 D graphics performance will drive an increased adoption of the discrete GPUs. OEMs will start over the next two quarters to offer desktop and notebook PCs that are Vista-ready as consumers will want to be sure their new PCs will fully support the new operating system.  Our MCP business achieved record revenue for its eighth consecutive quarter and grew revenue over 80% year-over-year. Driven by substantial increases in server and notebook design wins, we increased share of the AMD 64 segment from 42% in calendar Q1 to 52% in calendar Q2 as reported by Mercury Research. With the upcoming transition to AMD Rev F CPU, we have captured design wins with all the leading server and workstation OEMs and ODMs, which we believe will double our AMD server segment share as we exit the fiscal year. It was a record quarter for notebook chip sets. We had revenues growing substantially over Q1. We believe we\u2019re in a position to capture approximately 60% of the AMD Rev F CPU notebook segment business. We are thrilled that HP has incorporated our mobile nForce and GeForce products in their best-selling 15-inch and 17 inch consumer notebooks. We now ship our integrated GPUs to top PCL OEMs including HP, Gateway eMachines, Lenovo, Acer, Packard Bell, Fujitsu Siemens and we expect that list of OEMs to continue to grow.  During the quarter we introduced and shipped our new nForce 590 SLI, an enthusiast platform for AMD\u2019s latest AM2 CPU. Several weeks later, we introduced nForce 590 SLI support for Intel\u2019s new Core 2 Duo CPU. nForce SLI is offered in flagship PCs for both AMD and Intel processors from leading companies like Dell, Alienware, Falcon, Northwoods, Voodoo and many others. Maximum PC selected our SLI platform for their Intel Core 2 Duo-based dream PC.  We continue to execute our nForce commercial PC strategy and are pleased to include Lenovo\u2019s business PC group among our latest customers. We now have over 80 PC OEMs and system builders who now offer our NVIDIA business platform in their business PC product lines. VeriTest, a highly respected third-party testing service, reported that PCs built with NVIDIA\u2019s business platform offer excellent stability on par with those purchased by top global enterprises.  The NVIDIA business platform is the only stable image, enterprise class PC platform that supports both AMD and Intel CPUs. We believe as enterprisers adopt AMD and Intel processors interchangeably, our unique position will be an important advantage for us.  NVIDIA Quadro Professional business achieved a record quarter. Quadro revenues were up 27% year-over-year, and 17% quarter-over-quarter. Business was strong in all segments, especially in mobile work station and high-end Quadro.  We launched an entire spectrum of new products in Q2. Our new products addressed professional segments from business desktop to HD video content creation and broadcast, to the most demanding CAD and visual simulation applications.  The new Quadro line offers industry leading performance and quality for each segment, culminating with the flagship, 1 gigabyte Quadro FX 5500, the most powerful workstation GPU in the world. This new Quadro lineup is complimented by a range of solutions like Gelato, JemLock, NFDI that are becoming standards for advanced visualization and broadcast.  Two weeks ago, we launched the NVIDIA Quadro Plex, an entire new category of professional graphic solution. Quadro Plex is the world\u2019s first PCI Express base standalone external graphics subsystem, and can be connected to any workstation or server with a 16-lane PCI Express slot. An SLI-ready workstation can support two external GPU Quadro Plexes to support a GPU graphics supercomputer solution. When integrated in a typical, rack-based server, Quadro Plex offers 25 times more graphics compute density than traditional data center solutions.  Quadro Plex is a whole new class of visual computing solution. It enables thousands of engineers and designers to experience advanced personal visualization solutions previously only accessible in large visualization centers. Applications of Quadro Plex include HD broadcast video, industrial design, visual simulation, oil and gas exploration and medical imaging. Our handheld GPU business achieved record shipments of GPUs in Q2. This success was largely due to three factors. We are leading the rollout of mobile, digital TV with DVDH. These included the Samsung P910 handset used in Italy for the production rollout for the World Cup and trials elsewhere in Europe as well as the HTC Foreseer used in the first North American deployment. Two, we significantly grew our number of designs at Motorola, with several new phones starting to ship now, and three, we broadened our customer base to include phones developed in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea. We are starting to see the benefits from several key design wins at Motorola in their highly successful Razr and Sliver lines, with the Sliver L6i and L7i, as well as the Razr V3XX and the MotoRAZR MAX.  We launched a MobileMedia platform for handheld devices running Windows Mobile 5.0 at Computex in June. The MobileMedia platform is a complete development containing both software and hardware components that enables handheld manufacturers to rapidly design and release digital media rich devices with Windows Mobile 5.0.  Our MobileMedia platform continues to gain acceptance with additional design wins added to the Samsung, HTC and Raincom devices announced at our launch. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. When I return, I would like to address our opportunities as they relate to the AMD announcement in July.\nMarv Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. I\u2019d like to start by saying that since we cannot release GAAP financial statements for Q2, my comments will be limited. I will be able to comment on revenue and some balance sheet items, but I will not be able to comment on margins, expenses or earnings. Revenue for the second quarter was $687.5 million, which is up 1% from the first quarter and up 20% from the prior year. The revenue is in line or slightly above our guidance of flat.  The composition of the revenue was particularly positive. Memory sales declined by around $21 million quarter-to quarter and this was more than offset by growth in workstation and MCP.  Professional products increased by 17% quarter-to quarter and MCP also increased by 17%.  Notebook also increased by 12% quarter-to-quarter. Desktop GPUs declined by only 5% quarter-to-quarter as growth in the high-end GPUs offset some of the normal seasonal decline in mainstream. The result was that the unit volume decreased in desktop GPUs which you expect in Q2 was somewhat offset by a significant ASP increase.  So we had revenue growth in high-margin products and revenue declines in lower-margin products. Year to year, our core product revenue, which excludes Xbox, PS3 and memory, grew by 34% with notebook and MCP both growing more than 50%.  During the quarter, we repurchased $125 million of stock, which equated to 5.4 million shares. This caused cash to decline by approximately $100 million, as we also had an increase in accounts receivable. The accounts receivable increase in Q2 is normal as the quarter tends to be weighted towards the back of the quarter. The accounts receivable are still in good shape, with very little delinquency.  We had unit growth in inventory of new products, and unit declines in older products, as we had anticipated. This may have resulted in a slight inventory increase.  Depreciation in the quarter was $24.2 million and capital expenditures were $20.1 million.  During the quarter we added 252 employees and exited the quarter with 3,427 employees worldwide. Of the 252 additions, only 78 were in the U.S. as we continued our aggressive hiring internationally.  We believe spending for the quarter reflected a small quarter-to-quarter increase. The outlook for the third quarter revenue is as follows:  We expect increases in both desktop and notebook GPUs. Notebook increase is a continuation of our notebook design wins and the desktop increase is a reflection of the normal Q3 PC growth and the strength of our competitive offerings.  We also expect good growth in MCP, again from normal market improvement as well as from our new products. We expect workstation and handheld to be relatively flat.  When you put it all together, we expect quarter-to-quarter revenue growth of 8% to 10%. We also expect to continue our emphasis on gross margin improvements and very slight increases in operating expenses.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. On July 24, AMD announced that they were acquiring ATI. Once the acquisition is completed, NVIDIA will become the only GPU and platform technology company that supports Intel and AMD processors. Our company focus is to be the innovation partner for leaders of the computer and consumer electronics industry, to build high-brand, high-image, market-defining products.  GeForce is the No. 1 GPU brand. nForce is the No. 1 core logic brand. Quadro is the No. 1 professional and workstation brand, and SLI is the No. 1 multi-GPU brand. Each and every one of these brands is sought out by end-users of both Intel and AMD processors. AMD\u2019s pending acquisition of ATI only enhances our strategy.  The GPU is becoming increasingly important in all digital platforms. Our strategy is to extend the utility of GPUs to all types of multimedia processing and establish the GPU as the DSP of the digital media era. As we want to expand the reach of GPU into all computing devices, from PCs to servers to phones to automobiles, and in each of these markets we will support Intel or AMD CPUs, or ARM or PowerPC or Cell. Our strategic focus is the GPU. We will continue to partner closely with both processor companies and we will absolutely continue to provide MCPs for AMD as well as Intel processors. We will continue to invest around the AMD processors and continue to work with them to bring our brands to our mutual customers.  We also see increased opportunities in serving Intel\u2019s core logic segment, particularly since it is unlikely that AMD will do so. We have many exciting growth drivers ahead of this year. With the leadership position of our GPU, MCP, workstation and handheld GPU, we are positioned to continue to take share. We expect the grade three processing demand of Vista\u2019s new UI will increase the adoption of discrete GPUs in notebook and desktop PCs. The ramp of Blue-ray and HD DVD will play into a significant advantage we have with PureVideo HD. The highly anticipated launch of PlayStation III later this year and with the pending acquisition of ATI, the new PC industry dynamics puts us in a unique position. At the core of our growth is the continuing shift in focus of the industry to build products that are multimedia centric and consumer experience centric rather than a traditional focus on mix and megabytes. As the GPU is essentially the experiential processor of digital platforms, we see tremendous growth opportunities as we extend the reach of our GPUs into all digital devices.  We\u2019d be happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Thanks for taking my call today. I have three questions, basically. The first one is, if you look back at how revenues formed over the course of the quarter, can you talk about what linearity looked like? When did you actually see the bottom of the business and when did things start to get better?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Q2 is not typically a linear quarter. It\u2019s seasonally slow in a variety of geographies as you know and it typically tends to be a very slow May and it picks up very strongly in July, as people gear up for back-to-school. It\u2019s pretty much the same year-over-year from that seasonal pattern. Some parts of our market tend to see a little bit less of that. For example, the professional market tends to have a bit more linearity than that because enterprises tend to buy on a continuous basis. But it\u2019s pretty seasonal from that perspective.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay. I\u2019ve been visiting with a bunch of board makers and box makers over the last few days and a lot of them are telling me that the attach rates for discrete GPUs are going up pretty substantially in the third quarter. I wonder if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re seeing consistent in your business?  This may seem a bit odd, but I\u2019m wondering if the delay of the 865G chip from Intel, which seems to be having issues with graphics quality, is helping attach rates at all for you in the October quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, our belief is that as people gear up for Vista and because the user interface of Vista is so, well, it\u2019s completely built around 3 D graphics; every part of the Vista experience requires the GPU to render each and every one of the pixels from the transparencies, the special effects and the way that it\u2019s composited. The whole experience around Vista is really made possible by the GPU. So our belief is that as Vista ramp starts and Vista-ready PC ramp starts towards the second half of the year, the number of GPUs that would be included in PCs will increase. So that\u2019s our general belief. I really don\u2019t know very much about the issues with the 865G. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay, well thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Glen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.\nChris Caso \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Yes, hi. Thanks. You made some comments with regard to substantial increase in ASP and decline in units on the graphics side. Could you give us a little more color on magnitude of that? What you guys consider substantial?\nMarv Burkett: Yeah, well the ASP in desktop GPUs was up 16% quarter-to-quarter. Now, obviously that\u2019s mix related because the unit volume decline was primarily in the mainstream and we did very, very well in the high-end GPUs. \nChris Caso \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay, great. I guess \u2013 is that tied into the inventory increase that you guys saw? I mean, is that part of a change in mix and if you can give us some indication of what you guys expect for inventory going forward.\nMarv Burkett: Well, the inventory increases in the quarter were all in the new products, the new products we\u2019re announcing or about to announce. The inventory of the older products declined, and I\u2019m referring in this case to unit volume of those inventories declined. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to emphasize having enough inventory but I think that from a dollar-volume standpoint we probably have enough. So we will try to make sure that we don\u2019t grow inventory very much in the rest of the year.\nChris Caso \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay and just as a final question, just, you know, kind of speaking strategically with the AMD acquisition, what can you guys tell us about any kind of discussion or programs you guys have running with Intel right now. Just maybe you can kind of give us some sense of what you think that relationship might be going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, you know we have developments and collaborations going with both companies and we\u2019ll continue to invest around the AMD processors. Now, with the new industry organization, obviously it\u2019s unlikely that AMD will be designing core logic for Intel and so we see that as a pretty significant opportunity for us to participate in that. But we have so many collaborations going on with both companies, there\u2019s not really anything that we can talk about here.\nChris Caso \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey: Okay. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, thanks a lot, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities.\nMichael McConnell\u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. If we look at the wireless business, can you talk a little bit more about what exactly is happening at Motorola? Why you\u2019ve been able to take some share and if we look at the rest of the year, how that revenue line should start to shape up? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Our strategy, they\u2019re basically two \u2013 that\u2019s not true. I guess there\u2019s two or four GPU companies, depending on how you count them, in the handheld space. There are a couple of GPU companies in Korea who also build discrete GPUs for handsets. Our strategy is different than all the other GPU suppliers because we focus on the high-end, the multimedia-rich segments of the marketplace. Historically we focused on 3G. We expanded that focus to include smart phones and that\u2019s why we developed the multimedia, what we call the Mobile Media chip for Windows Mobile 5.0, Windows, you know, 5.0.  We\u2019ve expanded our scope to that. We\u2019ve also expanded our scope to personal media players. But our focus is very narrowly the multimedia rich and the high-end portable devices because we happen to believe that that\u2019s an area where we can add a lot of value. We also happen to believe that that\u2019s an area that\u2019s going to grow very fast as the majority of the world\u2019s handheld devices are going to become intelligent and they\u2019re going to become our most personal of computing devices, and multimedia is going to pay a huge role in that.  So we\u2019ve historically focused on the high end and now those multimedia features, whether it\u2019s digital video camcorder functionality or digital photography or 3 D graphics for better user interfaces, those devices and those capabilities are becoming very, very popular and so we think that we\u2019re in a really terrific position to expand reach into the marketplace including at Motorola because of that.\nMichael McConnell\u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Then, if we look at operating expenses and directionally, you can only talk about directionally, should we be looking after a pretty big spike here in the April quarter? The rest of the year to kind of just bump along, maybe flattish? Or are we expecting maybe it to work higher or lower?\nMarv Burkett: Well, I indicated last quarter that we\u2019d seen a spike in Q1 and we expected to. The growth for the rest of the year would be moderate. I think that\u2019s what you should plan on. You know, I think moderate growth from the Q1 step function.\nMichael McConnell\u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: That\u2019 very helpful. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Moors & Cabot.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Moors & Cabot: Thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you give us commentary regarding any sales to Sony or any in terms of the royalty ramp in October and beyond quarters? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have two types of activities with Sony. One of them is related to engineering and so it\u2019s expanding their manufacturing capacity as well as reducing feature sizes by porting them to new geometries. And so there\u2019s a very large amount of activity associated with that each and every quarter and I expect that activity to continue, certainly throughout this year and probably throughout next year. The royalty component of Sony we expect to happen this quarter. We don\u2019t know exactly how much yet, but Sony is in volume production as you know and they\u2019re gearing up for their highly anticipated launch towards the later part of this year so we\u2019re expecting revenue contribution this quarter. We just don\u2019t know how much yet.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Moors & Cabot: To follow up, the 8% to 10% sequentially growth is incorporating no contribution or some contribution from Sony?\nMarv Burkett: Small. \nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Moors & Cabot: Okay. \nMarv Burkett: When we say small, we\u2019re referring to royalties, not the fact that Sony would be small.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Moors & Cabot: Right. Right. Okay. Thank you.\nMarv Burkett: But I want to emphasis, Hans, that that\u2019s the worst \u2013 no royalty in Q2. \nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Moors & Cabot: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Dennison with UBS. \nRobert Dennison - UBS: Yeah. Thank you. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard on the call, Marv, you say that revenues were up in higher margin products and revenues were down in lower margin products. Does that give us any sort of directionality in what we should be looking at for gross margin this quarter?\nMarv Burkett: You know, yes I did say that we had revenue growth in higher margin products and revenue decline in lower margin products. You\u2019ll have to draw your own conclusions. \nRobert Dennison - UBS: Okay. Thanks. So did I miss anything on handheld growth rates? Did I miss a number there?\nMarv Burkett: Handheld revenue was up 12% quarter-to-quarter.\nRobert Dennison - UBS: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arnab Chanda with Lehman Brothers.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Jen-Hsun, if you could explain a little bit about your MCP business, how much opportunity would you get at Intel and are you assuming that if this merger goes through, some of the internal demand at AMD would be fulfilled internally? Do you think \u2013 is that how you\u2019re planning to address the business and do you think that business continues to grow at sort of the type of rates you\u2019ve seen or maybe at PC growth rates? I have a follow up, please.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, Arnab, our strategy with MCP is to focus on the segments where either the GPU, the leadership of our GPU position, or GPU technology could play a large role in those segments and so, as you can imagine, GeForce and SLI are two such incredibly important brands in the end market that it\u2019s unreasonable to expect an end user to have to pick which microprocessor GeForce and SLI supports. So these gamers they want to buy the latest in GeForce, they want to have SLI capability in their system. We want to give them the flexibility of whichever processor they would like to choose. So those segments we\u2019ll continue to serve and it\u2019s my expectation is that it will continue to be very successful in those segments.  In the segments where integrated graphics, or graphics technology, is important, the segments that we will see the most success is where branded graphics and the leadership of our technology plays a large role. I'm hoping that the coming year, as Vista and nearly all of the office automation applications that we know of today, starts to make the migration to use 3-D graphics, that 3-D graphics will be important in a much, much larger part of the overall market. I think that creates a lot of opportunity for us. So our focus is going to continue to be where our brands are important, where graphics technology is important. If we stay focused on that, I think we'll do a fine job for you guys.\nArnab Chanda - Lehman Brothers:  Thanks. One sort of qualitative question. You talked before about both operational improvements as well as royalties from Sony that could drive your gross margins higher. It seems like you had benefit on mix in the second quarter, if I understood you correctly.  Do you think that going forward, over the next sort of 12 months or so, those aspects that you're talking about, the operations and the royalty structure, could continue to drive those margins higher to your old target of 45% or so? Or can you maybe give us a qualitative understanding of that? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We haven't changed our expectation that our gross margins should be 45%, and in fact higher in the future. We ought to raise our expectations as soon as we get to 45%. There are broad and numerous operational improvement activities throughout the Company, and our operation, frankly, is world-class. The reason why is in the graphics industry, it requires an extraordinary level of operational excellence is because the technology is, obviously, extremely complex. These are some of the most complex semiconductor devices built anywhere, and the velocity of the business is very, very high.  So when you have very complex devices with very high-velocity businesses, you have to be on your toes, and you have to have extraordinary operational capabilities in order to reduce waste. So that's been an area where we've put a lot of energy over the last several years, and I'm going to continue to put energy around that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Naser Iqbal - Salman Partners.\nNaser Iqbal - Salman Partners: Congratulations on the quarter and the forward guidance, - great numbers. I only just have one question. Jen-Hsun, I guess, with all the announcements that have been that happening in the semiconductor space, and based on the comments you made -- and I know you're limited as to how much you can actually say. But what kind of comfort can we take in the announcement of what's happening with the stock options? Can you share any other color or comments?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  The audit committee's reviews are still ongoing, and we ought to give them every benefit to complete their analysis. So at this point I don't think there's really that much that we ought to say beyond everything that we've already said.\nNaser Iqbal - Salman Partners:  I appreciate that. Congratulations on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital.\nHan Lee - Global Crown Capital:  This is Han Lee for David Wu. Congratulations on the quarter. Jen-Hsun, you mentioned in your speech that you want to be the GPU for the digital media era. So, do you have any plans again to do business such as, say, TV tuners for the PC, or the very high growth high-definition TV area?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  That's a good question. I think our focus tends to be where the computing and digital technology intersects consumer applications. That tends to be our focus. Two very important words in there is computing technologies, and the other one, obviously, is consumer, which conveys multimedia and experiential elements to the technology. The digital television is not really a computing device today. It's not much more of a computer then a DVD player is. It's not much more of a computer than a set-top box is. Although it uses some embedded microprocessors and uses memory and such, the behavior and the nature of those devices tend to not follow those of computing devices.  As a result of that, historically we've stayed away from it, because they don't tend to be sustainable businesses. People have told me that flat-panel displays were exciting businesses and we ought to get into that because we know a lot about image quality. That's true. But, as you know, the flat-panel transceiver business has not scaled the way that GPUs have scaled. So we tend to follow the marketplaces where the experience continues to improve, the applications continue to improve, and the reach and the usefulness of the devices continue to improve; which, certainly, personal computers is one of them, handheld devices is becoming one of them, game consoles is one of them. I foresee many other types of digital devices in the future that will have these characteristics. That's where our focus will be.\nHan Lee - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. Also I have some questions about your inventory levels. You said that inventory will again increase this quarter slightly. So I'm wondering which kind of products is the inventory increasing? Is it in the higher-end graphics, or is the increase mostly in the newer MCP area?\nMarv Burkett:  I think what you're referring to is that I said that the inventory probably increased in Q2. I don't anticipate that inventory will increase in Q3.\nHan Lee - Global Crown Capital: Do expect the ASP trend to go on in Q3?\nMarv Burkett:  Beg your pardon?\nHan Lee - Global Crown Capital:  In Q2 your ASPs increased by 15% quarter-over-quarter. So, what's your expectation for Q3?\nMarv Burkett:  I think it really is dependent upon mix, because a major portion of that increase quarter-to-quarter was the mix, the fact that we did very well in the high-end and the mainstream had a unit volume decline. If we do very, very well in mainstream, you could even see ASP decline in Q3. It really depends on mix more than any individual product's ASP.\nJen-Hsun Huang: One of the comments that I will make is that we made a prediction a long time ago that SLI will increase the TAM of high-end GPUs. I think for all intents and purposes, whenever you have SLI in your system, and it has the opportunity to accept two high-end graphics cards, that's a perfect example of the doubling of TAM. So I think that the adoption of SLI and the popularity of SLI, and the increasing popularity of SLI, is quite a boon for high-end GPU markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Aberle - Caris & Co.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Co: First question is for Marv. I'm trying to figure out what the Q2 gross margin was. You did imply that Q3 gross margin was going to be up from whatever that level was in Q2, correct?\nMarv Burkett:  No, I didn't. I didn't imply anything. I just said that we would continue to work very hard to improve gross margins.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Co:  Okay. You said that OpEx would actually be slightly higher in Q3 then. That was the --\nMarv Burkett:  That's correct.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Co: Going into Q3, in terms of gross margin, I would expect that mix would revert somewhat. Could a potential boost be the PS3 royalties and get that margin up again in Q3?\nMarv Burkett: That's certainly one of the factors. Any royalties we get is 100% margin, so that helps. So, it really depends on the magnitude of the royalties. It depends on a lot of factors, but certainly that helps.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Co: Secondly, Jen-Hsun, I was wondering if you could just comment on the thought process of down the road, the convergence of CPU and GPU, and perhaps the integration of the two sometime in the future, what your take is on that and how NVIDIA plays into that scenario.\nJen-Hsun Huang: GPU is a very complex device. If you pop the lid of some chips, you'll discover that GPU is substantially larger than a lot of CPUs. So I guess one could argue that long-term, Moore's Law would enable some device to integrate some other device. But frankly, markets don't care about Moore's Law. Markets don't care about Moore\u2019s Law. They just care about what they need. The reason why the GPU has been separated from the CPU historically is because the two work off of completely different rhythms. And because of the different segmentations and the velocity of innovation, and all of those things, the GPU continues to be a standalone device for the segments in the marketplace that we serve. Our job isn't really to worry about which is going to integrate which; our job is to make the GPU valuable. That has been the historical focus of our company, to invest in helping people see how to program our GPUs, to invest in pushing the industry forward, and enabling the next level of games, or for industrial styling, or different applications of GPUs. Focusing our energy around that has been a much more productive exercise for us. Now, in some segments, we could imagine GPUs integrating with CPUs, or CPUs integrating with GPUs. But we'll approach those segments as it makes sense. Because oftentimes it's not necessarily one CPU. It could be x86. It could be ASICs, it could be PowerPC. It could be cell. It could be ARM. It could be something else.  So we believe that what we ought to do is focus on the market, and focus in advancing the utility and usefulness of GPUs, and focusing on advancing the GPU technology. I think we've been very true to that historically. We're true to it right now, and I think people are seeing the wisdom of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devan Moodley - Scotia Capital.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Good quarter. Just quickly, can you give us the split for the 7000 versus the 6000 series family this quarter?\nMarv Burkett:  Heavily, heavily weighted towards the 7000 family.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: Can you talk about sort of where you might expect, once G80 launches, the split to be towards the end of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We haven't announced G80. I don't know what G80 is, but we sell a lot of G7Xs.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital: A general question in relation to the AMD ATI situation. Do you think it creates any input cost advantage for you guys down the road, with potentially maybe the fear from the pure play foundry guys that AMD might take some of that business in-house?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't know if that is specifically the reason. Our focus is to be a strategic and a meaningful partner of the partners we work with. TSMC is our largest-single partner, and a terrific partner, and they've done a great job for us. Our job is to make sure that we can be as large and bring as much business as we can to this relationship. Typically, when you bring a lot of business to a relationship, there's some benefits. So my sense is that that is going to continue to be a dynamic that makes sense, and that's our focus.\nDevan Moodley - Scotia Capital:  Last question. Where do you guys see the PC market, in terms of growth back-half of this year, with Vista launching in Q1 '07? What's your expectation for growth?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I think everybody is thinking through that. Some of the smartest things that I've heard in talking to leaders of PC companies is that here in Silicon Valley in the high-tech industry, we're sitting here talking a lot about Vista, but the vast majority of America and the rest of the world aren't spending any time talking about Vista. They think of the PC as the PC. When Vista comes out, Microsoft will be incredibly energetic to promote Vista and get that in the forethought of just about everybody on the planet. When that happens, I think the Vista demand will drive up. In the meantime, my sense is that the back half is all going to be about Conroe and AM2. Conroe is a very exciting microprocessor, and it's brought a lot of enthusiasm and excitement back into the high-end segment. And I'm excited to see that. When there is energy in the high-end excitement and people are excited about Conroe and AM2, it's going to bring a lot of people back to buy high-end PCs. And most of those high-end PCs will, hopefully, have SLI and, hopefully, have GeForces in them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs:  Jen-Hsun, you touched on the collaboration with Intel on the MCP side as a result of the AMD announcement. Can you maybe also comment if there is any opportunity or possibility for collaboration on the GPU side, whether marketing or otherwise -- maybe specifically, if you have noticed any change in the trajectory of your design wins alongside Conroe before and after the announcement, for GPUs specifically?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thanks for the question. I would say that we're the only standalone GPU supplier in the world today, and we are CPU-neutral. We could be a partner for either company. I think we're a much more natural partner for either company today than ever before. I think you could derive from that that we're much more a natural partner today working with Intel than AMD would be working with Intel, in collaborating to build markets and otherwise. So I do think that's a very significant advantage.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs:  But did you see anything specific so far, any kind of inflection as far as how many people are designing a GeForce GPU alongside with a Conroe, as opposed to perhaps going down the path of a 1900 in a Conroe? Is that something where the perception has changed, or anything you've been able to track?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I guess there's probably some anecdotal stuff, but I think the high-level is that Conroe is all about high-end PCs. And high-end PCs really need SLI. And so we were in all of those design wins anyhow, and SLI only works with GeForce, so we were already in those platforms.  There's probably a lot more enthusiasm and energy in working together on Conroe platforms between Intel and our team, and I think that's a wonderful positive. But that's a segment of the marketplace that we already are quite successful in.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Just a quick follow-up on the MCP side. Given the different margin structure historically in AMD Core Logic versus Intel Core Logic, would you expect any meaningful change in your gross margins long-term as that mix shifts just a little bit more to Intel than AMD?\nMarv Burkett:\nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions-and-answers this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you all for joining us today.

I will now like to hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s first quarter conference call. Today we are pleased to report record revenue of $681.8 million and net income of $0.23 per share for our first quarter. Year-over-year, first quarter revenue grew 17% and net income grew 41%. We experienced growth in each of our businesses, GPU, MCP, handheld GPU and consumer electronics resulting in record revenue for the first quarter. We also entered multiple new product cycles during the quarter continuing our leadership in each of the markets we serve. As we move further into the new fiscal year, the growth drivers we outlined at our Analyst Day in March which included the adoption of Microsoft Vista, high definition video, and the launch of Sony PlayStation 3 will continue to accelerate and give us the opportunity for another strong year of growth. Let me highlight some of our first quarter fiscal 2007 results and achievements. Non-GAAP gross margin reached a company high of 42.5%, an increase of 230 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and 650 basis points year-over-year. GAAP gross margin was 42.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We shipped 8 new GeForce 7 series GPUs for desktop and notebook PCs and now offer a complete top to bottom family of GeForce 7 GPUs. NVIDIA grew share in the performance DX9 and combined DX9 desktop GPU segments from 79% to 83% and from 57% to 60% respectively from the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 to the first quarter of calendar 2006 as reported Mercury Research\u2019s First Quarter PC Graphics Report 2006. The NVIDIA nForce MCP product line achieved record revenue for its seventh consecutive quarter. nForce MCPs increased their share of the AMD64 segment from 35% to 42% from the fourth quarter of calendar 2005 to the first quarter of calendar 2006 as reported in Mercury Research\u2019s First Quarter Worldwide Chipset Report 2006. We continued to advance our leadership position in multi-GPU technology. The company shipped its first Quad SLI system for desktop PCs enabling 4 GPUs per system. We also brought our SLI technology to notebook PCs enthusiasts. NVIDIA demonstrated the world\u2019s first GPU-powered game physics solution at the Game Developer\u2019s Conference with Havok, the game industry\u2019s leading supplier of cross-platform physics engine middleware. Lifelike physics will bring a new dimension of realism and interactivity to games. We shipped our first integrated graphics processor (IGP) core-logic solution for AMD-based notebook PCs, the GeForce Go 6100 GPU and nForce Go 430 MCP. The core-logic solution is the industry\u2019s first high-definition IGP to provide hardware accelerated H.264 high-definition video playback. The Professional Solutions Group introduced 11 new desktop and notebook workstation solutions, designed to improve workstation graphics performance and representing the most extensive line of professional graphics solutions in the industry. NVIDIA and Intel announced a collaboration to bring high-performance 3D gaming and multimedia platform to handheld devices. The collaboration combines the NVIDIA GoForce family of handheld GPUs with Intel\u2019s newest processor family, codenamed Monahans, which is based on third-generation Intel XScale architecture, to develop a powerful development platform to content developers. We successfully completed our acquisition of ULi Electronics, a leading developer of core logic technology. And finally we acquired Hybrid Graphics Ltd., a leading developer of embedded 2D and 3D graphics software for handheld devices. The acquisition will enable customers of both companies to deploy rich graphic solutions for the entire worldwide handheld market. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. I will return to discuss our progress and outlook.\nMarvin Burkett: Thanks Jen-Hsun. I would like to begin with some comments about the P&L for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and then move to the balance sheet. I\u2019ll end with a few comments about the outlook for Q2. On the P&L, as Jen-Hsun said it earlier, revenue for the quarter was $681.8 million which is up 7.6% from the fourth quarter. The growth of almost $50 million was led by the GPU business which grew $21 million quarter-to-quarter. Within the GPU business, notebook grew by 34% and achieved record revenue. Desktop also grew slightly in spite of a seasonally down first quarter for the PC industry. MCP grew only 4% which was less than we anticipated but still achieved record revenue for the seventh consecutive quarter. Handheld GPUs grew almost 20% and also achieved record revenue. Memory and other also grew $12 million in the quarter. All of our business segments had some growth quarter-to-quarter. Year-over-year our overall revenue grew by 17% led by MCP and GTU businesses. MCP grew 65% year-over-year and GPUs grew by 10%. Our handheld devices almost quadrupled year-over-year but from a very low base last year. Xbox contributed $44 million in revenue in last year\u2019s Q1, therefore our core business grew 24% year-to-year. For gross margins we achieved 42.5% on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded even our expectations. The introduction and success of several new GeForce 7 products contributed significantly to the improvement. The GeForce 7 family contributed approximately $245 million in revenue for the quarter at excellent gross margins. This resulted in a noticeable increase in gross margin for our GPU business. We also had very good margin improvements in our handheld GPU business and it is now close to breakeven on an operating income level. Operating expenses were higher than we anticipated. There are many factors that contributed to this and I will outline a few. Going into the quarter we had not anticipated the acquisition of Hybrid or the hiring of significant number of employees from 3D Labs. These two contributed approximately $2 million of expense in the quarter. Also during the quarter there were significant option exercises by employees, this causes an expense for the company for FICA and other taxes that must be paid upon the exercise. This added about $4 million of unanticipated expense for the quarter. We will get this back later in the year when these employees matches our on FICA. Exclusive of these items operating expenses were still higher than we anticipated, as we were able to hire aggressively in other areas. We added 438 employees during the quarter approximately 200 of these were from ULI and another 70 were from Hybrid and 3D labs. When you put that together with our normal hiring the result was a significant increase in headcount. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 3175. The GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 17%, as we were not able to include the benefit of the R&D tax credit and so that is renewed by congress. When it does get renewed our tax rate will go down. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16% and that was also negatively impacted by the lack of an R&D tax credit. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 includes stock based compensation expense of $23.0 million as a result where adoption of SFAS 123R during the quarter. Our non-GAAP results adjust our GAAP results to exclude SFAS 123R stock based compensation and related tax differences. The net result was GAAP earnings of $90.7 million or $0.23 per share on a fully diluted basis. The shares outstanding reflect a stock split which occurred on April 6 and also reflect the new accounting per dilution under 123R. Under the non-GAAP earnings were $0.29 per share with the shares outstanding accounting for under APB 25, which is consistent with the prior year. On the balance sheet cash was up to $955 million and reflects that we spend approximately $90 million for the acquisitions of ULi and Hybrid. We also repurchased $50 million of stocks during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was 50 million. Accounts receivable was up by $73 million and reflects that the quarter was back end loaded due to the new product ramps all of which are now in full production. The aging of the receivables remains very good. Inventory was up $92 million as we started the production of several new GeForce 7 products. The increase in inventory can be accounted for by the new products. Depreciation during the quarter was $24 million and capital additions were $21 million. On the outlook Q2 is the most difficult quarter to forecast. It is the seasonally lowest quarter of the year for the PC industry, in addition our visibility is limited until later in the quarter. Our expectations for PCs are not substantially different from other companies in the industry. Normally in Q2 our desktop business declines along with the PC industry, and this has to be offset with growth in other areas. For Q2 this fiscal year we believe we can achieve growth in the notebook and MCP businesses and believe this can offset any other declines. Because of our new products we anticipate that our desktop business will be relatively flat. Overall we expect flat revenue. I would like to point out that with flat revenue in Q2 our core businesses would grow 35% year-over-year because last year\u2019s Q2 included $69.9 million of Xbox revenue. For gross margin our results for the first quarter exceeded our expectations and we will work very hard to hold gross margins at this level for the second quarter. We believe the actual gross margin will be a function of mix and any decline would come from significant revenue growth in lower margin businesses. Consistent with relatively flat sales, we expect relatively flat gross margin on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Operating expenses, both GAAP and non-GAAP will grow only slightly even though we will have the additional headcount for the entire quarter because of some benefit from the non-recurring cost that were in Q1. If the R&D tax credit is renewed we should expect to see the GAAP tax rate reduced in the second quarter. Thanks and I will turn it back to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Marv. During the quarter we enhanced our leadership position in to market. In Q1 we successfully delivered our entire family of desktop and notebook GeForce 7 GPUs to our OEM and channel partners. Our new GeForce 7900 GTX has captured design wins with nearly every major OEM offering enthusiast and performance PCs. Our calendar Q1 market share of the performance GPU segment increased from 70% to 83% year-over-year. SLI has become a standard feature in performance PCs. Over 4 million SLI enabled nForce MCPs and over 10 million SLI enabled GeForce GPUs have been shipped creating a large eco system of interoperable SLI components for gamers. According to the Valve Steam Engine which reports user\u2019s systems configuration we have over 98% share of the multi-GPU market. At E3 this week Dell demonstrated their next generation flagship PC powered by Intel\u2019s Conroe microprocessor and our next generation nForce and GeForce technologies. Also at E3 Alienware unveiled the world\u2019s first GeForce 7900 SLI notebook. Over 22 system builders around the world now offer SLI notebooks; we look forward to their transition to the GeForce 7900. In the mainstream segment we\u2019ve been focused on increasing our share. Whereas we have virtually no mainstream PC OEM wins last year, we are ramping design wins at Dell, HP, Gateway, Acer, Legend, Samsung, Medion, Packard Bell, TCL and others. The result of our design win success is starting to reflect in our segment share. Our calendar Q1 combined desktop DX9 GPU share increased from 54% to 60% year-over-year. We are gaining share in the notebook segment as well. The production ramp of our NASA design win refresh is underway. The notebook GPU product lines achieved record revenue for Q1 and as our OEM designs continue to roll out their new notebooks we expect our revenue and share growth to continue throughout the year. The DX9 generation of GPU is important to achieve the best experience with the new Microsoft Vista user interface called Aero Glass. Enabled by programmable shaders, Aero Glass will feature transparencies, textures, lighting and shadows making the Windows and objects on our PC look virtually real. John Peddie Research recently produced a research piece discussing the impact of Vista Premium\u2019s Aero Glass on the market. According to report, over 600 million PCs shipped in the last 3 years and are still in service. These are the ones that are the most logical to upgrade with the new Vista operating system. Because of the low graphics performance of integrated graphics chips found in most of the PCs they will not be able to take advantage of the richness and benefits of Vista\u2019s new Aero Glass GUI and graphics-based operating system would be unusable on most of them. It will take a performance level add-in board to pull out the richness built into Vista. When users see a system running Vista on a PC with integrated graphics, and then Vista on a PC with a powerful graphics add-in card in it, there will be no discussion, they will go for the better looking system as they can possibly afforded, those were quotes from the John Peddie Report. In the coming months, we will witness of the next-generation high-generation video formats. The introduction of Blu-ray disc and HD-DVD will bring high-definition movies to our homes. The BD/HD associations have announced that nearly 100 movie titles will be available in these new HD formats by the end of the year. As a standard for PlayStation 3, millions of Blu-ray players will be available this year, with 6 times the resolution of today\u2019s DVD. Blu-ray disc and HD-DVD is a major advance in resolution and quality from the 7-year old DVD format. The image processing requirement is nearly 30 times that of DVD and will require a special video processor to achieve full performance. Our investment in our PureVideo, dedicated video processors and algorithms will help us bring the HD experience to PC and media center users. We believe we have won every major OEM HD-DVD and Blu-ray design win to-date. Blu-ray and HD-DVD equipped desktops and notebook PCs that incorporate our GeForce 7 GPU and PureVideo video playback technology are going to deliver incredible high-definition movies. We continue to gain share in the AMD server, workstation desktop and notebooks segments. Our share of the AMD platform increased 6% to 42%. On Tuesday this week, HP announced the HP Pavilion DV2000 and Compaq Presario D3000 thin and light notebooks with the GeForce Go 6150 and nForce Go 430 marking NVIDIA\u2019s entry into notebook integrated chip set business. We are preparing our next-generation nForce pipe on the series MCP for the upcoming launches of both the Intel Conroe Microprocessor and AMD Socket AM2 Interconnect. We will be introducing some new and exciting technologies in the 500 families that will raise the performance bar for the industry. The digital media revolution is also driving the growth of our handheld GPU business. Downloaded video like episodic TV shows, broadcast digital TV for sports and news. And high resolution graphics for rich user interface, rich user interfaces, and games are driving the demand for handheld GPUs. Our target segments are 3G phones, Smartphones and portable entertainment devices. We believe that the graphics and multimedia capability of our handheld GPUs has put us in the perfect position to benefit from the increasing multimedia demands of Smartphones which was only 17 million units in 2004 and growing to 100 million units in 2006. The increasing availability of digital media content for 3G has driven demand of our handheld GPUs. Our share of the 3G market grew from 7% in 2005 to 12% this year. In a market that has grown from 72 million handsets last year to an estimated 210 million in 2007. Our newest handheld GoForce 5500 GPU has been designed into DVB-H phones in North America, Europe, and ISDB-T phones in Japan. These are phones that are capable of receiving digital television. Two out of the first three DVB-H Television service launches in the world are based on phones powered by NVIDIA\u2019s handheld GPU. Because of our dedicated H.264 and WMD processors, we are able to deliver the highest image quality at a power level that will enable several hours of enjoyment, and at E3. Sony announced that the highly anticipated PlayStation 3 will be available in Japan on November 11, followed by simultaneous availability in North America, Europe and Australia one week later on November 17. Sony committed to ship 4 million PS3s by December 31 and another 2 million units by March 31, 2007. There are number of positive industry dynamics taking place this year and we believe our product roadmaps and technology leadership, technology leadership uniquely positioned us to drive these trends and produce another year of strong growth. Thank you and we will be happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: (Operator's Instructions). The first question comes from Tayyib Shah with Longbow Research.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Congratulations on the quarter. Can you talk about what, what\u2019s happening in the MCP business, it seems like the share gains against in the AMD platform were kind of flat lesser, is that likely to change in the fiscal second quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all thank you. Yeah our market share of the, of the MCP business was below our expectation as well. And there is a variety of theories and I think that this one makes the most sense. We experienced that early on the quarter there was, there were some obsolete inventory that were, were sold by one of our competitors in Asia and these were extremely low cost, low cost products and they were based with integrated graphics with AGP. And so I think that reduced the overall market for our products, but it did increase the demand for GPUs because those, the integrated graphics in those products were simply too obsolete, and so we experienced an increasing demand of entry level AGP, GPUs as a result of that. Now my sense is that, that\u2019s not going to continue but that\u2019s our estimation of what happened in Q1.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Okay and then if I can ask about the margins, can you talk about the opportunity for your 7300 product line in the value segment replacing your 6200 products, how rapid that transition is going to be and what does that do for your overall margins?\nMarv Burkett: Well easy answer is that it improves our margins because the margins on that type of product are better than the GeForce 7 family than they are in the GeForce 6 family. How rapid we can make that transition I don\u2019t think its much a matter of production as it, as it has market acceptance.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Okay thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Randy Abrams with Credit Suisse.\nRandy Abrams - Credit Suisse First Boston: Yes good afternoon guys. Wanted to see if you can pull up on the revenue guidance I think you made some flat desktops and then up notebooks, and chipsets to get to a flatter role is that employment some of the smaller businesses like handset and other declines or maybe you could clarify that over?\nMarv Burkett: Yeah I don\u2019t think that you should take into that that we expect a decline in handset. Remember the memory and other was a fairly large number in Q1, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to that in Q2. If that number did not go down and desktop did not go down I think that we can achieve revenue growth but there is just a lot of unknowns along those lines.\nRandy Abrams - Credit Suisse First Boston: Okay and maybe the follow-up question, just on the inventory, maybe when if you go into, again I think you met new products ramping. But wanted to understand just the driver of building inventory, if the revenue trajectory is roughly flat in the coming quarter and is there some motivation from tighter supply to form your back end without inventory at this stage?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah that the way to think about that Randy is that, Q1 was our product transition quarter and we transition down our GeForce 6 family and we, ramped up GeForce 7 family. And typically, in the beginning of a product ramp, we want to be prepared to make available as much of our products to the marketplace as possible and give our OEMs and the channel the opportunity to sell their pipelines. And so, that\u2019s, this is pretty typical stock and its, its reflective of how we make product transitions. I mean the most important thing is just make sure that we have enough 7900s and 7600s and 7300s for the marketplace.\nRandy Abrams - Credit Suisse First Boston: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Thanks a lot. Nice job on the gross margins, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Mark.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Let\u2019s see a couple of quick ones first Marv, can you give us what the NRE was in the quarter and what you expect NRE to do in Q2?\nMarvin Burkett: Roughly, $20 million to $25 million in the quarter, around numbers 23 that was the Sony NRE and licensing together. Then your second question is what you are expected to do, roughly flat.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And then Jen-Hsun to me under stand all the issues here that you\u2019d look for the current quarter, can you just give us your senses to what see here the most important drivers as you look at the second half of the year and maybe you can try to put those in the context of seasonality. It seems like, you\u2019d actually have quite a few things that ought to give you a better than seasonal lift even some of the things you\u2019re approaching right now.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, we entered Q2, we always enter Q2 with caution and as just, there is a lot of markets that are taking a pause but we have a lot of good things going for us, GeForce 7 is really a terrific architecture and we continue to ramp into the marketplace with GeForce 7. We have the benefit this year of also winning a lot of the OEM design wins that we simply didn\u2019t have last year, both on the desktop as well as the notebook segments. And so we\u2019ll be ramping into those OEM design wins. We also have, have some pretty terrific handheld GPU products. We have the benefits of PlayStation 3 ramping, they have obviously announced pretty wide availability and simultaneous worldwide launches of, in the November timeframe, which means that that at this point they are clearly manufacturing at full throttle, and so you have that going for us. And then, our MCP business continues to grow. Its, our expectation is that this year over last year we should, we should be in a position to grow substantially in MCP. Two reasons, one of which is when Intel\u2019s Conroe microprocessor does well, it creates a larger performance segment and we have a strong presence in the performance segment as you know, and so that that should help us. And then secondarily, this is our first year with, first full year with integrated graphics built on, built on the desktop as well as notebook computers and so this is very exciting. And then, the last one, it\u2019s not insignificant, it\u2019s blu-ray disc in high definition video. This is first major consumer electronics transition in 7 years. And if you take a look at what\u2019s been going on in the consumer electronics world over the last 5 years or so, it\u2019s really been about High Definition displays and flat displays. Well, finally, they have something they can really drive it and that\u2019s blu-ray disc and HD-DVD. And the processing requirement for BD and HD are so high compared to DVD that you really need to have a dedicated video processor, and this is something that we been talking about and offering to the marketplace. Obviously, with standard definition it was kind of hard to demonstrate the value proposition, but now with HD becoming the value of our video processor is crystal clear, and it\u2019s reflected in all the design wins we have from media centers, and notebooks and PCs that are going to out in blu-ray and HD-DVD. So, I think that we\u2019re positioned than ever before. We have more product drivers and market drivers than ever before, and if we continue to execute, I think that we\u2019re going to have a pretty good year.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: That\u2019s great. Just one last one if I could, based on this opportunities should we expect inventories to increase again in this quarter as you basically get prepared for the second half of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our expectation is not, it just that when we\u2019re ramping new products, we have to make sure that we help our OEMs and help our channel partners to fill their pipeline. And so, there is always that initial surge of supply, to just supply everybody with GeForce 7s. And so, my expectation is that once we get through, get going here we are going to level out to typical ways of managing our inventory.\nMark Edelstone - Morgan Stanley: Okay thanks a lot guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah thanks a lot Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wu with Global Crown.\nHun Lee - Global Crown Capital: Hi, this is Hun Lee calling for David Wu, thank you for taking my question, I have a few question, regarding you said for the gross margin upside, primarily due to the GeForce 7 increase in sales, and I have been checking up on a few, online websites, and I have seen some shortages so that doesn\u2019t quite match the picture that you provide. So could you please give some more clarity to that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well at some level I think it\u2019s perfectly aligned with the picture we have provided. We just went through a production transition in Q1. And we ramped down the 6800 and the various GeForce 6 products and we ramped into the GeForce 7 products. And the demand has been really strong. The 7900 has been a product that we have had a hard time catching up with. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are building aggressively to fill the market pipeline and to meet the market demand. And I think as I said in the prepared comments, that our performance segment, GPU market share is increasing. And so it reflects that the demand for GeForce 7900 is quite high. And the 7600 is incredibly high. And so you just got to take that into consideration. And the other thing to remember is that SLI takes 2 GPUs per PC. And so the number of gamers in the world and the number of game enthusiasts haven\u2019t declined, and in fact, they have probably grown. But now they consume 2 GPUs per PC. We have always felt that SLI would increase our TAM and I think in a lot of ways, it has.\nHun Lee - Global Crown Capital: Okay, that makes a lot more sense to me now. And another question is for your upcoming nForce5 or the Tritium chipset or could you please comment a little bit about the performance and the gross margin for those? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our next generation core logic, our next generation MCP nForce5 will unambiguously be the highest performance core logic in the world. And that\u2019s what it was designed to do and that\u2019s our expectation. And it\u2019s intended to bring some new exciting features at a marketplace that the market\u2019s never seen. Give me a chance to launch that product and I\u2019ll come back next quarter to report on the things that we said.\nHun Lee - Global Crown Capital: Sure. And how about the gross margin, are they going to be above, below, or at the popular level?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Above.\nHun Lee - Global Crown Capital: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Pflaum with Thomas Weisel Partners.\nJason Pflaum - Thomas Weisel Partners: Yeah, good afternoon and good job guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Jason.\nJason Pflaum - Thomas Weisel Partners: Just to circle back again on the inventories little bit, if you could just help on the composition of the composition of those inventories again and the fact that MCPs is kind of little bit lighter than you expected it was out partly reflective of the build there as well?\nMarv Burkett: Yeah I think that\u2019s unique take a look at, we grew inventory round numbers, $19 million quarter-to-quarter. But on the new products we grew inventory roughly $115 million. So of the older GeForce 6 product suite decreased inventory commensurate with what we are trying to do. We did build a little bit more MCP inventory that we anticipated because the MCP sales didn\u2019t achieve what we thought. So there is a little bit more there. But I think that what you should understand is that in general the growth in inventory was driven by the new products.\nJason Pflaum - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. And then just can you give us a sense of what portion of your revenues, are going to distribution this quarter? You continue to look that down and was that also a contributor perhaps in holding a little bit more inventory?\nMarv Burkett: Yeah I mean it does contribute as we take customers more direct. I don\u2019t know that it was significant though. There two major distributors that everyone focuses on for us even in Atlantic we\u2019re below 12% of our business together, each of them below 6%.\nJason Pflaum - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. And then just ask question on the handset side of your business, obviously saw some nice growth there this quarter and good momentum. Can you just characterize or give us a sense for the breadth of some of the design wins that you have now going into the second half, maybe just give a flavor for how many the top shooters maybe shifting to there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess we have design wins with 4 to 5 top handset manufacturers in the world. Most of our handset design wins are focused on 3G cell phones. Many of the new handset design wins are now being designed into digital television cell phones and smart phones. Those are really our target markets. We haven\u2019t played much in the basics graphics GPU business in handsets and there the reason for that is just there is not just much value to add. We tend to focus all our energy on the really rich multimedia capabilities like digital television or video playback or digital camcorder functionality or digital cameras and of course graphics. And so, we tend to focus a lot of our efforts around those types of applications and we are trying to play into emerging and growing market trends. And this is a, we have been talking about how we believe that your handset device is going to become one of your most important computers in your life and increasingly becoming less perceived as just a modem or just as a handset, as a telephone and I think that vision is really playing out and if you believe in that vision then you have to believe that graphics and multimedia technologies are going to be important in that that's really our focus.\nJason Pflaum - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay. Thanks guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicholas Aberle with Caris & Company.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Good afternoon. Just why don't you just touch base a little bit more on the performance mainstream segments for discrete desktop, based on our analysis really seems like you guys have got a nice competitive advantage there, superficially on the 7600 products. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy in that particular segment of the market, and some of your expectations for market share gain there, over the course of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess our strategy is to build the living daylights out of it.\nMarv Burkett: We can't.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, that's a, it's a pretty sizable market and it's an interesting segment because the volumes are large and also the ASPs are high. And so the technology requirements are pretty demanding and the gamer want the absolute best. And the distribution channel wants to have the best brand and wanted the price they believe and they know they can sell. And so the 7600 family is really perfect for that and it's, follow-on to our 6600 family and so my expectation is that we will do better with 7600 than we do with 6600.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Perfect. And then just one more quick follow-on, you guys did touch base on the impact of delayed just operating system, more chatter about that being pushed out even further into mid\u201907. Does that change you guys, outlook on the effects of that operating system launch at all?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Not really, I think that ending end in the grand scheme of things this is what this is the first major operating system upgrade in quite a long time. I think it's probably close to 7 years, isn't it. And this is the first operating system in the history of humanity that requires a GPU. And as more and more applications get loaded with more and more wedges, and more and more of the Vista Aero Glass capabilities, the graphics demand on your desktop is. On your desktop is going to just continue to increase and there is just not been a single person that is ever seen it that says I can go back. Everything is better, the fonts are better, the resolution is better, the way that the window glides across the desktop is just, everything is just delightful about it and so my sense is that that this Aero Glass is going to create quite a bump for GPUs for quite some time. And so were looking forward to that. We are disappointed as anybody does, that is surpass, go surpass this year but it doesn't fundamentally change anything in the final analysis.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Perfect good luck and keep you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hey thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham Incorporated.\nQuinn Bolton - Needham Incorporated: Let me add the congratulations on a great margin. Wanted to see if you just look back historically over the various generations of GeForce processors, you guys tended to match out it, sort of match market share readers an performance from the overall desktop segment, when you guys were getting pretty high over 80% now in the performance segment, 605 of the discreet, historically have you gotten a lot higher than that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah I guess so, I mean, I think that, I am trying to think here. Our focus really isn't just share. We have always been since the beginning of our company focused #1 on increasing the market and it\u2019s about bringing new ideas and new technologies and new features and capabilities to this marketplace and also about expanding the reach of it. One of the best things that we ever did was, was working with Microsoft and folks out in Redman to talk about the importance of the GPU and helping them understand how it could really transform the computing experience. With that's going to increase the markets of GPUs. Our SLI increased the TAM of GPUs. This recent addition of a feature that we added to our GPUs called Physics, it's going to make your SLI system that much more valuable. You could either use both graphics for, both GPUs for game rendering or if particular has a great deal of physics you can use one of the GPUs for physics processing. There is sort of versatility in the new capability that we bring to the marketplace. We just continue to increase the scope in the reach of the marketplace. So, that's always been our focus just to continue to add more value.\nQuinn Bolton - Needham Incorporated: And then second I might have a missed a bit I just wonder if you could make any comments sort of the how the workstations business quarter-over-quarter was that another record?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We grew slightly and had a record quarter.\nQuinn Bolton - Needham Incorporated: Great, okay, thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, Quinn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Pranay Laharia with Deutsche Bank.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Hi, a question for you Marv, can you please rank your segments, sort of MCPs, notebook graphics, desktop graphics, workstation, cell phones in the order of gross margin growth that you expect to see in those segments from here onwards through the end of fiscal '06, or fiscal '07?\nMarvin Burkett: Well, wow.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hey Pranay, I think that was like 6 questions.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay, I will abbreviate that. Rank your segments in the order of gross margin growth from here onwards?\nMarvin Burkett: I don't even, you even broke it down between segments\u2026\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay, just combined GPU then\u2026\nJen-Hsun Huang: Very good question\u2026\nMarvin Burkett: The desktop GPU business should increase gross margin because of the GeForce 7. I mean, margins are excellent of GeForce 7, beyond that, are we going to increase gross margins in workstation, I don't know they are pretty high right now. Are we going to increase gross margins in notebooks? Yeah because, it's going to transition to GeForce 7.\nJen-Hsun Huang: MCP should have some gross margin left and also on the other hand has a deeper market penetration which was against gross margins, because the gross margin lift comes from new generation of products that you will be launching obviously, and then on the other hand, you have got our integrated graphics ramping into desktops and notebooks, let's see what was it, the handsets\u2026\nMarvin Burkett: So you have a lot of things going in different directions like Jen-Hsun said. The individual components of MCP might be growing, but if we ship more of the integrated, it will have a negative effect on the whole business unit. Handheld, gross margins have been pretty good, are we going to be able to sustain it, we will see.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that the question that you asked ultimately is, highlights the fundamental dynamic for all companies who are simultaneously pushing new technologies and new features which helps gross margins as well as capturing more of the market, bringing that technology to more people which tend to commoditize the technology. So we have those fundamental tensions in our business like everybody else, and hopefully overall we are improving gross margins as a company, our gross margin improvement in the company is not just coming from new products. I mean it's coming from just a corporate wide operational enhancement and drive in the company and its, our business is extremely high velocity, so its not easy to do what we are doing, but we have to create a lot of new ideas to enhance our operational performance, and so that's where we great at those things, coming up with great ideas.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay very good. Just a quick follow-up if I may. Trying to reconcile some of this impact, it seems like all the leading integrated graphics vendors pulling yourself ATI and even Intel with broad warrant test line, I was stating that their chipsets, integrated graphics chipsets are either already they\u2019re premium capable or they will be very, very soon. And despite these plans, it seems like you guys still think that to speed traffic it's going to take bump up with Vista launch now. Can you help me reconcile these two views on some of these Vista premium capability claim is it just hollow or not up to mark?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Absolutely you asked a really good question, I\u2019m glad you asked it. The way to think about it is this, today on non-Vista just Windows XP the performance experience of your Windows experience and my Windows experience is identical and I don't even know what you have. Everybody's Windows XP experience is identical because the graphics technology far exceeds anything that Windows XP requires. However the moment that Windows Premium, Vista Premium and Aero Glass comes out people who have GPUs will have a noticeably better experience, noticeably better experience I mean you would have to fallen asleep to not notice that you have a noticeably better experience, its almost no different than video games which based on the same technology. So you would expect similar dynamics that somebody with a GPU is just going to have a better experience with the game then somebody who has who doesn't have a good graphics technology and so you are going to have exactly the same thing. Now when somebody can actually notice the different when a consumer can get an appreciable better experience with a GPU those are the type of dynamics that we love. We\u2019re encouraging to by a better GPU, we\u2019re encouraging incursion to upgrade and we're encouraging to buy a GPU from the retail market to enhance their computer all of that is good for us.\nPranay Laharia - Deutsche Bank: Okay thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rick Schafer with CIBC World Markets.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Hi guys this Dan Morris calling in for Rick first of all, good quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Just a house keeping question you mentioned that high grade and 3D effects added about 2 million to OpEx, could you also quantify how much you added to OpEx during the quarter and what contribution that was on the top line from the acquisitions?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Just as a quick clarification that was 3DLabs.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Okay.\nMarvin Burkett: For the OpEx.\nJen-Hsun Huang: For you and for all of us, this brings back memories.\nMarv Burkett: Yeah Hybrid and 3DLabs, the people that we picked up from there, plus the amortization associated with Hybrid cost us about $2 million in the quarter. We acquired ULi sometime in February so we picked up roughly 2 months, little over 2 months worth of ULi. It contributed somewhere around 8 to 10 million in revenue and about 3 to 4 million in expenses.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Okay, great. And then a follow up, there has been a lot press recently about physics and specifically physics processors. You have also added few press releases and demos of your mechanic and Intel gate. I was wondering if you could talk more about your views on the discreet solution and also elaborate on some of these announcements and physics plans?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. I guess what I will do, I will elaborate on physics and why it\u2019s so good. I mean obviously if you take a look at most of the environments that you see in video games and others the environment is by and large static. I mean there are some movement of water and leaves and what not, but they are contrived. And so I think that physics and applying physics to all of those objects in the environment in the world will just make the world look a lot more alive. And whether the way you interact with it or just the way you look at it, so, physics is going to terrific. The second thing is the more objects that you create, the more objects you have to render and so from a graphics perspective that's really terrific as well. It just creates more workload for us to have to go and overcome and we like that. With respect to physics processors it\u2019s hard to say exactly whether there is a unique market for it. But that's not what we are too concerned about it. We wish those guys well. Anybody who wants to build physics processors as well and it's good for the gaming industry. But from our perspective the GPU is a completely programmable device and it does, floating point and mathematics probably faster than any processor know to man since the beginning of computing and for us to redeploy the physics processing is a wonderful use of the investment that's already been made.\nDan Morris - CIBC World Markets: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities.\nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes, you alluded to be chip business being somewhat weaker because some IGP chipsets having a different pricing, do you feel that the if the cemetery is there, and have been worked off and we are returning to a more demand supply environment, in the AMD platform market, or whether this refer to just AMD platform for both Intel and AMD?\nJen-Hsun Huang: At the price of those, the fact that it was so far below market pricing and frankly, so far below cost, I can't imagine anybody enjoying that kind of business unless its really just to get rid of the excess inventory. And so my sense is that that it\u2019s, it's not going to happen on a regular basis. But we have to keep our eyes on. But the important thing to realize is that we know, we are not just offered core logic as a company, we also our GPU supplier and when those integrated graphics are sold they tend to be, they tend to be very, very low end and have to create some opportunity for us to sell a discrete GPU. And so it probably works its all, works itself out in the grand scheme of things, but on balance we still prefer people go to market.\nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And then just a follow-on question, you talked about the requirements for discrete, graphics on desktop, do you see an equally comparative need for desktop and notebooks, so will the caller excitement for notebooks will keep the trend towards integrated graphic there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think you have compelling desire in both. And I think the, of you want to dedicate a processor at something, always will do a better job than a general purpose processor in a power environment, power sensitive environment and so that the discrete GPU will do a wonderful job for you as well as do a good job monitoring power as we go. My sense is that this is going to be good for GPUs all the way around.\nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Great. And my final question Marv, can you give me some sense for how to model the licensing and raise your revenues going forward for PS3 in the August and November quarter?\nMarv Burkett: Well, certainly for Q2, we expect that Q2 will just be a combination of NRE and license fee and the numbers that I gave you for outlook we do not incorporate any expectations for a royalty. I would expect that we will receive royalty income in Q3 the magnitude with, give you a number right now. So Q3 would be more of the same plus royalty.\nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Okay thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, Krishna.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi thanks very much. Can you tell us what percent of your GPU sales in the quarter that you spent, it was from the GeForce 7 family, and do you have an estimate as to what percent of sales for GPUs is going to be GeForce 7 in the second quarter? \nMarvin Burkett: Well, I think I said in my comments Simona that we spent more than $250 million in GeForce 7 in the GPU business in Q1. And so that was well more than 50%.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and how much do you think that will be in the second quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It should be a lot more.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay. It just seems that with your inventory build of $150 million of new products, that would kind of growth up to $330 million in revenues of the new products, if you kind of apply 45% gross margins, so would that be kind of what you guys are looking for, that seems like it will be a pretty aggressive number?\nMarvin Burkett: Well I mean, obviously it depends on the market, but there is nothing wrong with the kind of numbers that we have laid out there. The GeForce 7 is a very good product finally.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then maybe just somewhat relatedly, when you are expecting your desktop business to be roughly flat in a PC environment that's likely going to be down, are you expecting that to be a function of share gains or higher blended ASPs or both?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Share gains.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just lastly for your gross margin guidance were flat, it seems like with such a significant mix of your GeForce 7 business as a percent of the total, and then the same thing happening in notebook, what is going to be driving it down to kind of flat gross margin in the second quarter?\nMarvin Burkett: Mixed, we expect MCP to do better.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And you think that's going to be in a thought that all of the other notebooks in the desktop GPU transition?\nMarvin Burkett: Yes.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks very much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Simona. So previously I had answered a question incorrectly, I was asked whether workstation revenues was a record, we broke 100 million again, but it was not a record. It was down quarter-to-quarter by 1%.\nMarvin Burkett: Yeah, down close.\nJen-Hsun Huang: So, it was basically flat.\nOperator: Ladies, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to reporting our progress for 2Q this month.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we do appreciate your joining us today. This does conclude our conference call and you may now disconnect."}], "2009": [{"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-02-13 23:02:08", "content": "Executives: Michael Hara - Investor Relations Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Marvin D.

I will now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report another record quarter and fiscal 2008 was another record year. We had many achievements this past year.  Q4 revenue grew 37% year over year to a record $1.2 billion. Annual revenue increased 34% year over year to a record $4.1 billion. Annual net income increased 78% year over year to a record $797.6 million. Annual gross margin reached a new high of 45.6%, an increase of 320 basis points from a year ago.  We launched a record number of industry-defining products and initiatives this year -- GeForce 8800 family, including the highly acclaimed 8800GT. We\u2019ve sold over 2 million 8800GTs in just four months of production and demand continues to exceed our forecast.  GeForce 7000 -- the first motherboard GeForce for Intel systems. Together with the CPU, the GeForce 7000 enables the first two-chip Intel processor PC.  CUDA -- the industry\u2019s first parallel programming environment that puts the massively parallel processing capability of a GPU in the hands of all programmers. CUDA is available on every one of the 50 million GeForce 8000 series GPUs that we\u2019ve shipped. We expect to ship several hundred million CUDA GPUs over the next several years. CUDA has quickly become of the most pervasive and accessible parallel programming environments ever.  There is increasing recognition that the traditional CPU alone architecture, or homogenous architecture, is not optimal for every application. With CUDA, we have launched a new computing movement towards heterogeneous computing, where a traditional CPU is combined with a massively parallel processing GPU to achieve a giant step up in performance.  Visual computing is one of the most well-known parallel computing applications. There are many others. Applications such as physics processing, computer vision, video image processing, are just a few examples that are dramatically enhanced by CUDA and heterogeneous computing.  Engineers and researchers in software companies, computer companies, and in universities around the world are recognizing the importance of heterogeneous computing. This is a major movement in computing.  Tesla -- our new family of server workstation class GPUs with supporting system and software technologies for high performance computing. The first Tesla 1-U rack contains four GPUs, each with 128 processors, delivering a whopping 1.1 teraflops of sustained super computing performance in a real world application.  Hybrid SLI -- like a hybrid car, Hybrid SLI allows a small GPU and a large GPU to work together. The small GPU runs light visual computing workloads while conserving power. When heavy workload is required, both GPUs combine their capabilities to deliver the most delightful experience. With Hybrid SLI, we can deliver the ultimate visual computing experience while enabling an environmentally friendly power efficient design.  And lastly, PureVideo HD -- the first video decode and post-processing technology for Blu-Ray and High-definition DVD.  Year over year, annual revenue of each core product line turned in strong results. Desktop GPU revenue grew 38%. Notebook GPU revenue grew 114%. Workstation grew 27%, MCP revenue grew 7%.  NVIDIA held the number one segment share in desktop GPU, notebook GPU, all of DX9 and DX10 GPUs and workstation solutions. NVIDIA was named the most respected public company by the members of the Fabless Semiconductor Association for the second consecutive year. NVIDIA was named Company of the Year by Forbes Magazine.  We acquired Mental Images, the industry's leading photorealistic rendering technology provider. Mental Image's Mental Ray is the most pervasive ray tracer in the industry. And lastly, just this week we announced the completion of the acquisition of AGEIA, the industry leader in gaming physics technology. We are pleased with our achievement this year. Particularly, we are very pleased with our strategic position heading into fiscal 2009. Let me turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results. I will return in a moment to address our growth opportunities for the coming year. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Today we\u2019ll be looking at both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201908 and for the full year of fiscal year \u201908. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is primarily stock-based compensation and its tax effect. In Q4, there is also an in-process R&D write-off from the Mental Images acquisition.  As Jen-Hsun stated, revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, which is an 8% increase quarter to quarter. The growth quarter to quarter came from desktop GPUs, which grew 19% and workstation, which grew 9%. Notebook and MCP were up slightly at 1% and 2%. The strength in desktop came from new products such as the GeForce 8800 family.  Comparing Q4 fiscal year \u201908 with Q4 fiscal year \u201907, revenue was up 37%, led by notebook and desktop. Notebook was up 124% year to year and desktop was up 69%. Workstation grew by 31%.  The consumer business declined 22% for the year. The strength that we saw in desktop GPUs for Q2 and Q3 has continued through Q4 and shows signs of continuing in Q1, demonstrating the growing importance of the GPU in the PC system.  For the year, we had revenue of $4.1 billion, which is up 34%.  Gross margin for the quarter was 45.7% GAAP and 45.9% non-GAAP. This was the first time in 13 quarters that we haven\u2019t had a non-GAAP gross margin increase quarter to quarter. During the quarter, we experienced some cost issues with regard to the 8800GT, which we hope to resolve in the next two quarters.  For the year, GAAP gross margin was 45.6%, which is up 320 basis points.  Operating expenses for the quarter were $287 million GAAP and $251 million non-GAAP. The GAAP number includes a $4 million write-off of in-process R&D associated with the Mental Images acquisition. It also includes approximately $32 million of stock-based compensation.  The non-GAAP operating expenses were up $13 million quarter to quarter, or 5.5%. And this includes an additional $3 million of operating expenses associated with Mental Images. The revenue for Mental Images in the quarter was less than $1 million.  We continued to aggressively hire during the quarter and ended the year with a headcount of 4,985, which is up 376 from the prior quarter and up 902 over the prior year. Approximately two-thirds of the headcount additions for the quarter and the year were in the R&D sector.  So for the year, revenue was up 34%, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 25%, and headcount was up 22%.  The tax rate for the year was 11.5%, which is slightly lower than we anticipated as the mix of international sales was slightly higher than we had forecast. This resulted in a GAAP tax rate for the quarter of 8.2%.  For the quarter, the GAAP earnings per share were $0.42 and the non-GAAP were $0.49. For the year, GAAP earnings were $1.31 and the non-GAAP was $1.56.  On the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities was $1.8 billion, down $43 million from Q3 and up $692 million year to year. In the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock, purchased Mental Images for cash, and also purchased some EDA equipment and services.  The operating cash flow in the quarter was a little over $250 million.  Accounts receivable grew by $114 million, reflecting both the shipment profile in the quarter and the increase in revenue. The accounts receivable is very current and there are no issues with regard to payment.  DSO in the quarter was 50 days.  We built $52 million in inventory during the quarter, all of which was in new products. Inventory continued to be lean at 50 days, up only slightly from Q3. Depreciation was $37 million in the quarter and capital expenditures were $70 million.  For the year, capital expenditures was $188 million.  On the outlook, we expect revenue in Q1 to be better than seasonal. We expect continued strength in desktop GPUs, seasonal weakness in some others, and the result is we believe revenue will be slightly down.  For gross margins, we\u2019ll certainly try to get back on track of increasing gross margins and would expect margins to be flat to slightly up.  We expect operating expenses to increase quarter to quarter because of the normal Q1 issues of less vacation in Q1 than Q4, higher FICA expense in Q1 and Q4. In addition, we expect to have approximately $7 million of incremental expenses in Q1 that will come from acquisitions we\u2019ve recently made.  The result is that we expect operating expenses to increase 8% to 10%.  Since the R&D tax credit has not yet been renewed, we expect there will be an increase in the tax rate until that happens. If the R&D tax credit is renewed, we would expect a tax rate of 13% to 14% for the year. Until that happens, our expected tax rate will be approximately 17%.  With that, I will turn it back over to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mark. We are entering the era of digital computing. Applications with rich graphics are growing with astounding numbers. Videogames is now a $43 billion industry and larger than movie box office receipts and music. World of Warcraft, commonly known as WoW, is a massively multi-player 3D online roleplaying game with over 10 million active users.  According to Comscore, a leader in measuring the digital world, 217 million videogame players immerse themselves in online 3D worlds and that number is expected to grow 17% annually.  Google Earth combines the power of search with rich imagery and 3D terrain and is transforming the way we navigate. There have been over 350 million unique downloads of Google Earth to date.  Modern operating systems, Windows Vista and Apple OS 10 Leopard, deliver amazing 3D user interfaces. Combined, the two operating systems have shipped over 100 million copies to date.  Our growth reflects the increasing importance of the GPU in these applications. We shipped a record 80 million discrete GPUs last year. Including motherboard GeForces, we shipped a total of 111 million GPUs.  Our annual discrete GPU revenue grew 50% year over year. Our Q4 discrete GPU revenue grew 80% from a year ago.  Consumer demand for the richest visual computing experience is driving a movement to rebalance the architecture of the PC. The CPU has become good enough for the vast majority of users.  Meanwhile, a higher performance GPU will directly result in a dramatically more beautiful and fluid user experience. PC enthusiasts, gamers, and design professionals have known this for some time. They have long been the strongest proponents and consumers of the GPU.  Let me give you some recent examples from Gateway. The Gateway P series FX, a very thin gaming HD video notebook, priced at $1249 and features a GeForce 8800 GPU and a lower-end 1.6-gigahertz CPU. Relative to a notebook with a higher end CPU and lower end GPU, the Gateway FX is twice the performance and yet $200 lower cost.  Here is a recent quote from a CNET review of the Gateway FX 7020 desktop PC: \u201cGateway\u2019s FX 7020 represents the type of PC we expect to see a lot of in 2008. The $1,000 to $1,500 gamer that finally has the graphics horsepower to handle the newest 3D PC games. Its AMD Phenom quad-core CPU isn\u2019t the fastest CPU around, although it is quick enough. But the real horsepower lies in its GeForce 8800 GT graphics card. Until now, few PCs in this price range have been able to handle the likes of Crysis, Unreal Tournament 3, and other new PC games with any kind of decent image quality. This PC and the forthcoming systems like it should finally deliver the promise of next-gen PC gaming to a wider audience.\u201d OEMs and consumers around the world are learning the same thing -- the CPU is good enough. Investing more on the GPU will deliver a several-fold jump in application performance and experience. We call this trend the optimized PC design approach. The balance of CPU and GPU processing should reflect a category of PCs, whether it is gaming PC, lifestyle PC, workstation PC, all-in-one PC or enterprise desktop PC.  We are excited about the coming years. The era of visual computing and the movement towards optimized PC design approach will make the GPU evermore central to our computing experience. At the core of that experience is the GPU. This is the decade of the GPU.  We\u2019d be happy to take your questions now. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Tim Luke, Lehman Brothers.\nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Thank you so much. Marv, I was wondering, as you guide for the first quarter to be slightly stronger than seasonal, if you could frame for us how you have perceived seasonal in terms of recent percentages, either down or -- and maybe within that, you talked a little about the strength that you\u2019ve seen in desktop, how we would perceive some of the different segments to look through the first quarter. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Okay. Seasonal to me is for our business is usually down nominally 5%. I think that the PC in general is down 5% to 10% but for us, it\u2019s historically been around nominally 5%. So when I say down, I say it will be down less than that.  And with regard to the strength in the desktop GPUs, the strength in Q4 and Q3 has been very, very good in the performance segment, the 8800 GT. As Jen-Hsun said, is selling very, very well and so we would expect continued strength there. So I would say anything in the performance and up segment, the desktop GPUs is doing very well. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: In some of your recent updates, Marv, you had suggested that while you had seen the strength in the performance end of the desktop area, you\u2019d seen a little bit of volatility in the notebook arena and I was wondering if you had any recent updates as to how you\u2019ve seen that.  And then separately in recent updates you had said that you had been targeting growth for the calendar year coming of at least in the 20% range, I believe. And I was wondering if you could give some flavor on how you see the different building blocks of that rate of growth going forward. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, notebook in Q4 was up 1% quarter to quarter, so it certainly didn\u2019t decline. I think that\u2019s pretty good performance. I would expect it to come off seasonally in the first quarter.  With regard to \u201908 in total, I don\u2019t think I have any change to what we previously talked about. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And with respect to the segments within that, do you have any feel for how we should think about modeling the different areas?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Growth in desktop GPUs, growth in MCP, growth in workstation. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Krishna Shankar, JMP Securities.\nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Yes, as you look at your April quarter, you indicated strength in the desktop GPU market. Do you see sort of broad-based strength there across all segments of the desktop graphics market or is it more in the high-end enthusiastic performance class market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, we\u2019re seeing growth in the GPU business. I mean, it\u2019s year over year, our GPU business grew 80% and you can\u2019t grow that in just one particular segment. We\u2019re seeing growth across all of the segments.  We\u2019re seeing increasing adoption of GPUs. We\u2019ll seeing simultaneously a bias towards slightly higher end GPU and all of that is consistent with our belief and what I\u2019m sure you believe and most consumers experience today, that more and more of the applications they enjoy are graphically rich. And so I think that people understand increasingly that rebalancing the system so that more GPU horsepower could be dedicated to the experience will result in a much higher performance and so PC OEMs, consumers, gamers, have already known this. Workstation professionals have always known this. Design professionals have known this and one PC OEM after another are building computers where the CPU is just good enough and a lot more resources are dedicated towards the GPU and the products are selling incredibly well, because frankly they benchmark well, they use well, and it\u2019s just a much more delightful experience overall. \nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: And just to follow-up, in terms of the competitive landscape, do you see -- how do you describe the competitive landscape in MCPs, especially in the notebook market? And also the dual-chip X2 configuration that AMD has come out with recently -- can you talk about the NVIDIA products that would be coming out to compete with that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. So let\u2019s see -- you asked -- I think there were four questions all together. Okay, so competition in MCP space -- the way we see it is this; we have the only GeForce motherboard solution for both Intel and AMD platforms. We are bringing Hybrid SLI to those platforms and for anybody who enjoys a -- who don\u2019t want to sacrifice a rich graphics experience and all the compatibility with all of the applications around the world, even though they purchased an entry level PC, a GeForce on a motherboard is really the best way to go.  And so we continue to see success there. My expectation, our expectation this year is that we are going to grow the MCP business pretty substantially. A lot of that has to do with the fact that this is the first year where we have GeForce motherboard GPUs for the Intel systems, and so we are expecting that to be -- to do quite well.  With respect to the notebook area, my sense is that wherever we don\u2019t differentiate substantially, we won\u2019t win the business. And if the customers don\u2019t care about graphics performance, if it\u2019s an enterprise notebook or the competition has a GPU solution just as good as ours, you know, certainly we won\u2019t expect to win the business.  But other than that, I think we are going to do quite well. Overall, I think we are going to have a great year for MCP.  With respect to X2, you know, you would only put two GPUs -- well, let me come at it another way. If you want to put two GPUs in an add-in card and you deliver the absolute highest performance in the world, the enthusiast that uses that particular PC will certainly tolerate the fact that it\u2019s a much larger solution.  But if it\u2019s not the highest performance solution in the world, as in the case of the X2, then it\u2019s just really problematic. You know, there\u2019s no market really for a product that\u2019s larger, louder, and not as high performance. And so I think that GeForce 8800 GTX is still absolutely the best DX10 and highest graphics performance GPU in the world and works great in SLI and we\u2019re going to shortly announce, or shortly ship, three-way SLI.  And so multiple GPUs on an add-in card is only tolerated if it is unambiguously the highest performance. Anything short of that is just too clumsy to be successful. \nKrishna Shankar - JMP Securities: Thank you. \nOperator: Gurinder Kalra, Bear Stearns.\nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the cost issues you experienced with the desktop GPUs in the current quarter. Can you discuss them in more detail and how you expect them to get resolved?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, 8800 GT was ramped probably faster than any high-end GPU in our history. As I mentioned in my comments earlier, in just four months of production we shipped over 2 million 8800 GTs, and this is a high-end GPU. The die size and the number of transistors of the 8800 GT is far more than any microprocessor you currently have -- core-two dual and otherwise. And so this is a very complex processor and yet we ramped it incredibly hard.  We had some manufacturing challenges in the beginning and we caught it, we fixed it, and now we are going to see far better yields going forward. But it affected our cost in Q4. \nMarvin D. Burkett: From my standpoint, our focus was delivering the product to the customer. Demand outstrips supply, so rather than focus on bringing the costs down, we focused on getting the product out. \nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Okay, great. And then secondly on the AGEIA acquisition -- hope I\u2019m saying that name correctly -- now, where do you think it enhances revenue opportunities and does it mean that you are open to more end markets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, you know, physics processing and bringing dynamics to games is an area of a lot of excitement and many games already have physics in it but rudimentary physics, and people want to put a lot more physics, a lot more dynamics into games. It just brings the whole game to life. Now it looks beautiful and it behaves realistically, whether it\u2019s water or cloth or emotion or -- you know, particle systems or whatever it happens to be.  Physics processing and the AGEIA engine happens to be extremely computationally intensive. It requires just a lot of processors to deliver the type of real time performance that the games need.  Our strategy is to take the AGEIA physics engine, which has been integrated into tools and games all over the world, and we\u2019re going to port the AGEIA physics engine onto CUDA. You know, you heard in my comments that CUDA has now shipped into 50 million processors, GeForce 8 series processors and over the next several years, we\u2019ll ship a few hundred million more. The ability to port the physics engine on top of CUDA and accelerate the physics is going to add a ton more value to gamers around the world.  Our expectation is that this is going to encourage people to buy even better GPUs. It might and probably will encourage people to buy a second GPU for the SLI slot and for the highest end gamers, it will encourage them to buy three GPUs, potentially two for graphics and one for physics or one for graphics and two for physics, or any combination of -- you know, any dynamic combination thereof.  So I\u2019m very enthusiastic about the work that we\u2019re doing here and the game developers are really excited about it. You know, finally they are able to get a physics engine accelerated into a very large population of gamers. And so I think this is a -- this combination between us and AGEIA really kick-started the physics industry. \nGurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns: Okay, great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Brian Piccioni, BMO Capital Markets.\nBrian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets: Hello there. Just following on with the question with respect to the AGEIA acquisition, would you have a timeline where we would expect to start seeing the impact in the actual product offering?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re working towards the physics engine to CUDA port as we speak and we intend to -- we\u2019re going to throw a lot of resources at it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it helps our GPU sales even advance of that, and the reason for that is in the end, it\u2019s just going to be a software download.  Every single GPU that is CUDA enabled will be able to run the physics engine when it comes. \nBrian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets: So we are primarily talking a software rather than physical changes to the internal organizations of the GPU then?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That\u2019s right, because what makes it possible is CUDA. You know, every one of our GeForce 8 DX10 GPUs run CUDA. CUDA is a parallel programming model that is programmable through C. And so we are going to port physics, the name of their engine is physics, we\u2019re going to port physics, the physics engine onto CUDA and access all of the parallel processing capabilities. And in the case of the 8800, 128 processors in our chip so instead of running it on only two cores, now we can run it on 128 cores. And so our expectation is that the parallel processing capability would really dramatically enhance the performance. \nBrian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets: I see. And I guess you wouldn\u2019t agree with your competitors\u2019 comment that physics is dead then?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Why would physics be dead?\nBrian Piccioni - BMO Capital Markets: Thank you. \nOperator: David Wu, Global Crown Capital.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call, or question, rather. Marv, can you sort of split us the various business segments in Q4 of your -- you know, the typical breakout in your 10-Qs? And the other thing I wondered is the -- can you talk a little bit about the economics of AGEIA? It sounded like the first quarter will be dilutive but when could it be accretive?  And lastly, on the situation on the 8800, to improve your cost, does it mean that you can still run on 90-nanometer process, just tune it a bit or do something to get your costs down? Or do you need to -- are we talking about a potential die shrink down to 65-nanometer or 55-nanometer to get the required traditional margins that you get on these high-end discrete chips?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Wow. All right, David, let me start through the business segment breakout that we would show in the Qs. The GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory, was up 11% quarter to quarter. The PSB area, which is workstation and some other products, was up 10% quarter to quarter. MCP, which is our platform products group, was up 2% quarter to quarter. And then that leaves you with the consumer business, which was down roughly 18% quarter to quarter. So that\u2019s the segment breakout that I think that you were looking for?\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yeah, yeah. \nMarvin D. Burkett: All right. Now, with regard to the 8800 on the cost bank, it doesn\u2019t require us to do anything differently in terms of process technology or a redesign of the chip. It\u2019s just a focus on getting -- you know, improving the yields and doing the product engineering, which we haven\u2019t been able to focus on because of demand outstripping supply. So -- it\u2019s just hard work and we\u2019ll do it. It does not require a process change or anything else.  With regard to AGEIA, obviously it will be dilutive because of the lack of revenue in the first quarter and probably until -- being able to classify it as accretive is going to be associated with how many more GPUs we sell because of that. So I\u2019m not worried about it from that standpoint.  Mental Images obviously in Q4 was dilutive and probably will be dilutive in Q1. We\u2019ll see about that. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Okay. So AGEIA, it\u2019s not such a big -- not that you need to have a lot of revenue to cover it and some incremental hardware you sell?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Okay, great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Doug Freedman, American Technology Research.\nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. You spent a lot of time talking about the GPU computing opportunity. Can you spend a little time talking about how a general purpose computing engine might be required to grow that market and what your view is for your needs going forward of a general purpose computing engine?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me make sure I understand your question, Doug -- your question is -- when you say general purpose computing engine, do you mean the general purpose application for GPU computing?\nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: I\u2019m referring to a -- whether it\u2019s a MIPS processor, a general purpose computing processor as opposed to a strictly parallel machine. \nJen-Hsun Huang: No, GPU computing already has a processor. We believe in heterogeneous computing and basically the CPU that\u2019s already in your system, it\u2019s good enough. It\u2019s fabulous. Billions and billions of dollars of R&D has gone into making that CPU as good as it can be and for single-threaded applications, you know, I think it\u2019s a -- the performance of the CPU is a miracle of mankind. I mean, it\u2019s fabulous.  But they\u2019ll never scale very well from here on out and for the type of parallel applications that we believe are really interesting to solve, and so the problem space that we focus on are all of the type of applications that require a lot of parallel processing capability.  So we believe that the world needs a heterogeneous computing model where the single-threaded, flexible CPU is combined with or collaborates with a massively parallel processor, in this particular case we call a GPU. And when we introduced CUDA, which allows the GPU to be programmed with C and compiled to with a C compiler, we really, really opened up that computing paradigm and it\u2019s just because C developers don\u2019t really want to program their problems in OpenGL and Direct 3D and C is a much more natural approach for them.  And so heterogeneous computing includes the CPU and the GPU and in terms of answering maybe a related question about what is the consumer mainstream application for GPU computing, physics is a really good example of the first one. Physics processing is already in so many games, as you know, and it\u2019s going to be in almost every single game in the future.  And all of a sudden, with physics on CUDA, we\u2019re able to bring accelerated physics processing to every PC in the world. And so I think CUDA and GPU computing, or heterogeneous computing, however you want to think through it, is -- this year will officially be a consumer-oriented mainstream processing model. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: All right. Could you help us understand a little bit of what expectations you guys have for the DX10 chipset marketplace? How soon and how quickly you think the chipset market is going to move to a DX10-based solution -- what percentage by the end of the year, if that\u2019s possible?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I believe in order to get Vista certification by the second half of the year, you require DX10. And so it becomes a requirement for Vista starting the second half of the year. So I think the answer is we ought to get there as fast as possible and we are trying to get there as fast as possible. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: All right, great. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Hans Mosesmann, Raymond James.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thanks. A couple of questions; Jen-Hsun, in terms of the X2 type or class of products that are out there, will NVIDIA introduce a product like that and will that establish or become over time the standard at the very, very high-end of the market? And I have a follow-up for Marv. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We would do an X2 like product only if it delivers performance that is simply not possible anywhere with a single GPU. But there\u2019s no question that a single GPU is a better approach. It\u2019s better use of bandwidth, it\u2019s -- the processors collaborate much, much better and the overall performance is just unbeatable.  And so if we can\u2019t deliver that performance with a single GPU, we\u2019ll do it with double GPUs and -- but either way, it has to be the absolutely highest performance.  So you know my preference and you know we have -- we have a lot of evidence and certainly know for sure that a single GPU is the best approach and -- but if a double GPU can deliver the highest performance on the planet, it would be accepted. If it\u2019s not, then you\u2019re going to have problems. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: And so, just to kind of go further there, what you are saying is that in the near-term, it\u2019s unlikely that you are going to see something like that from NVIDIA, that you\u2019ll stick with the single solutions in the near-term?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hans, I don\u2019t talk about -- we can\u2019t talk about future products. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: All right. Well, I understand your preference and -- \nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m so happy selling my current products. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: All right, fair enough, Jen-Hsun. Marv, real quick, just a share count or an expectation for number of shares in the April quarter? And that\u2019s it for me. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, it was around 600 million I think as you\u2019ve seen at the end of the fiscal year. I don\u2019t expect a significant change going out of Q1. It might be up a little bit but basically not much change. That telegraphs the fact that we intend to buy more stock back in Q1. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Fair enough. Congratulations. Thank you. \nOperator: Heidi Poon, Thomas Weisel Partners.\nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners: Hi, guys. Responding to the earlier question about your growth target for the year, I think you mentioned that it is still around 20%, so that\u2019s seriously above the industry growth rate. Could you discuss, you know, of course the MCP growth is in there but are we also talking about maybe some serious share gains or holding off AMD in the notebook area?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, and we -- we\u2019re just -- maybe just unsuccessful in communicating this but I think the GPU, the entire GPU market is growing. We\u2019re gaining a little bit of share but it\u2019s not significant. They\u2019re single digits, low teens. The whole GPU market is growing and the whole GPU market is growing because the computing experience is more visual than ever. And the reason why it\u2019s more visual than ever is because more applications than ever before require rich graphics or take advantage of rich graphics. And so we are just selling more GPUs and the GPUs we are selling are slightly more powerful all the time.  And so Heidi, that\u2019s really where the growth is coming from. I think GPUs is our growth engine and we really believe that this is going to be a big year for GPUs again. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners: And is that expectation across the different platforms, like desktops, laptops, workstations, incremental gains in Tesla for this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Absolutely. We\u2019re expecting growth everywhere. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Secondly, could you comment on for the growth in Q1 and Q2, maybe the pricing environment and also what you are seeing in terms of any demand differentials in international versus U.S.-based demand?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re seeing dramatically different demand in all the different regions. Heidi, if you look at our growth Q4 to Q4, it\u2019s 80%, and so -- I\u2019m not suggesting that Q4 to Q4 will be 80% again. I hope it will be but I\u2019m not suggesting that. But the point being that there is some evidence that the consumption demand for GPUs is increasing and our expectation is that the growth of GPUs will overcome the seasonalities, whatever seasonalities that there is in Q1 and Q2. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners: Great, and the pricing environment?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Pricing environment -- pricing is good. We\u2019re seeing more money spent on GPUs so it has an appreciation in the average selling price for all of the GPU business. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Shawn Webster, J.P. Morgan Securities.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions and good quarter. On the -- just to follow-up on the pricing question, can you tell us what your sequential change in pricing was for your GPU business?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Up nicely. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Up nicely? Okay. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yeah, it\u2019s because we shipped a lot of the 8800 GTs, as Jen-Hsun said, so you would expect that. And so, you know, in the various segments the pricing was good. We would have had an ASP appreciation because of the higher volume of 8800 GTs. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay, and then Marv, on the OpEx growth in Q1, can you give us a sense of how you expect your OpEx to grow after Q1?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Oh, internally Jen-Hsun and I are working hard to keep it flat. We\u2019ll see how successful we are. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Like what, like very small incremental changes?\nMarvin D. Burkett: We\u2019ll see how successful we are. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay, and then finally, can you talk about the supply environment and do you have any of your products where they are seeing lead times extended?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Supply is certainly an area of great concern of mine. You know, we are becoming -- we are the world\u2019s largest fabless semiconductor company. The products that we build are very complex and the die sizes of our high-end GPUs is significantly bigger than CPUs and we now sell, as you heard earlier, over 100 million units a year and it\u2019s still growing. And so these processors are -- consumer a lot of wafers and we are already the world\u2019s largest, so it is important that we work very, very closely with our foundry partners.  TSMC has done a wonderful job for us, UMC has done a wonderful job for us and my expectation that we\u2019re going to take the fabless model to new heights. But when you are as large as we are and running as fast as we are, you can never take supply too seriously. So we obviously take it very seriously. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: And are you seeing your lead times stretch out or pull in for your graphics or chipsets? What\u2019s the lead time environment like?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The lead time hasn\u2019t really changed. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: No change? Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Michael McConnell, Pacific Crest Securities.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. Looking at the guidance, Marv, for better than seasonal for Q1, is this really unique do you think to NVIDIA with respect to you had a lot of pent-up demand obviously for the 8800 GT, supply now is starting to improve, so with that dynamic that leads to, like you said, some growth in the desktop GPU business? Is that it or is there something more here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think -- Michael, let me take that question. I think the GPU is just growing. I think the GPU market is growing and frankly, it ought to help anybody who builds a GPU. And so I consider -- the way I see it is visual computing is just becoming evermore important and so if other suppliers of GPUs are seeing ever-increasing demand, I\u2019m not surprised by that.  That\u2019s kind of -- it\u2019s not to do with -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re capturing that much share. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, and then if we look at just the competitive landscape for the fiscal year, can you just talk about what you think from a unit share perspective or a revenue share perspective, probably more importantly, with each of the three main business lines? Or even the four, if you talk out maybe desktop GPU, notebook GPU, MCP, and then workstations, relative to this last fiscal year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re that prepared to answer that question. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Not for a full year. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t think we break it out quite clearly that way. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Any timeframe though that you\u2019re comfortable with at this point to discuss?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Yeah, last quarter. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I really couldn\u2019t -- I\u2019m really trying to say this so that we all kind of hear it -- I believe we are growing the market. I mean, the share gains are nice and we\u2019re going to continue to fight for our share and fight for more than that but -- but I honestly believe the market is growing. But you can\u2019t look at the size of the GPU market by combining the -- by looking at last year\u2019s GPU market of all suppliers, okay? And then try to think that this year, the opportunity is shifting a few dollars from here to there, because I don\u2019t think that makes any sense.  If that was the case and you added S3 and Cirrus Logic\u2019s revenues together and Trident\u2019s together of when we started, NVIDIA would be a $300 million company. And so obviously the GPU market and visual computing is becoming more and more important and what we are seeing here is and what we believe and what we had hoped all along is that the GPU is -- the overall market for GPUs is growing.  And so you have to look at -- I frankly think that you have to look at -- in order to see the opportunities, you have to look at the entire electronics spend of the PC industry. There is a vast movement to re-architect the PC, to shift the resources around to deliver the best possible experience. And the best possible experience for each market category or each PC category [inaudible]. A gamer\u2019s PC would have a different allocation of electronic spend. A all-in-one consumer multimedia oriented PC will have a different, another allocation.  And so you have to look at all of the electronics dollars in order to decide how best to estimate the growth opportunity. But I think share is just simply not that interesting anymore and certainly it doesn\u2019t explain our growth. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, and then just a final one for me on the gross margin -- obviously the company has done a great job through the years of continuing to expand the gross margins. Taiwan Semiconductors talked ad nauseam over the second half of last year about trying to renegotiate pricing with some of their larger fabless customers. I understand the rationale behind what happened with the 8800 GT from a cost standpoint. Is there any type of pricing negotiations that also came into this with respect to the gross margin in Q4, or is that just -- it\u2019s just purely demand exceeding supply and then as that -- we start to see more balance, the gross margins should start to come back?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The gross margin impact of 8800 GT or the increased cost of 8800 GT was completely my fault. It has nothing to do with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation. And we will have to accept all of that responsibility ourselves, unfortunately, and so -- now, the good news, of course, is that because it was completely our fault, we can completely fix it.  I think that that one -- let blame where blame needs to go here. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, so this is not anything in terms of pricing negotiations -- this is something that you think we can start to look -- we can continue to expand gross margins as we work through the fiscal year, you\u2019re fairly confident on that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We would love to blame other people, Michael. Sometimes you have --  (Multiple Speakers)\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: Tayyib Shah, Longbow Research.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Hi, guys. Jen-Hsun, can you please describe the competitive landscape in the notebook space -- you versus AMD and then also discrete graphics versus integrated, as you head into the next refresh cycle?\nJen-Hsun Huang: In the notebook segment, AMD has wonderful offerings. Don\u2019t forget that AMD still has a terrific GPU design organization and so between NVIDIA and ATI, or AMD, it is the unambiguously the two best GPU design teams the world has ever seen. And so I give them a lot of respect and in the AMD notebook segments, the lower end segments, it is hard for us to differentiate relative to AMD. And as I said earlier, if we can\u2019t differentiate, we don\u2019t typically win the business.  And so I\u2019m not surprised and we\u2019re not expecting to win any of those. We are going to fight hard for them but in the final analysis, I think AMD has good offerings there. In the upper half of the market, we have quite a bit of differentiation. Our advantage is that we invest more in GPU development than any company in the world today and potentially all of the competitors combined. And so our R&D investment, our commitment to GPUs, our velocity of innovation, that is our advantage on the upper half of the market, whether it\u2019s notebooks or otherwise.  So we have to -- that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s our velocity, our commitment and our level of innovation and level of investment is a structural advantage and so we have to sustain that. \nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Okay, and Marv, just curious how you were able to build some inventory during the quarter -- does that reflect slightly better supply from the foundry or was this related to demand trends?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, it\u2019s new products in the pipeline. You know, if you looked at the inventory build where it actually happened, it\u2019s all new products which are just in the pipeline. \nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Thank you. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Glen Yeung from Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Thanks. So Jen-Hsun, can you just be clear as to what you think the PC market is actually doing in this environment? I understand that GPUs are growing and you may or may not be taking share within that, but just your overall sense of the PC market. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We monitor sell-through and we\u2019re fine. I mean, what we see is fine. We monitor our own sell-through. I guess I don\u2019t monitor other people\u2019s sell-through but sell-throughs look fine. You know, we watch it every single week around the world and it looks good.  I don\u2019t really know what else to say. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: No, fair enough. Any [differentiation] with what you see between an OEM basis or a white box basis?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Not really. Not really. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay. \nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, I think that it\u2019s possible that the SKUs that we are in are selling well. It\u2019s possible that people are preferring platforms that we\u2019re designed into but I don\u2019t really know. I think that overall, overall I believe that the movement -- there\u2019s two things that are happening that are very, very big deals that I believe that we\u2019re experiencing and we\u2019re experiencing all over the world. The first thing is the importance of visual computing and therefore the GPU at the core of that. The second thing is the re-architecture of the reallocation of resources within the PC, that for different types of PCs, you ought to spend and invest your resources in different components. And so the balance between the CPU and the GPU is changing and I think those two factors combined are really, really important and we -- I don\u2019t believe that to be a one quarter thing. I think it\u2019s logical that is should be a permanent thing. It should be a forever thing.  It happened to cars. It happened to just about any other mature industry that as the industry matures, you see all of these -- it bifurcates into the niches and the niches become large and in order to make a niche product specific, you can\u2019t use the basic platform. You have to optimize it for the needs of that niche. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: I think I hear you and when I think -- I guess I\u2019m thinking if we can add the product strength of the 8800 GT, then one can conclude that even if we were seeing some slowing in PC units at the moment, those trends may outweigh that -- fair assessment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, I do, I think that\u2019s fair. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay. And then just a quick question, Marv, for you -- you\u2019d mentioned you\u2019ve had some cost issues with the 8800, working through it. In your inventories that you had exiting the fourth quarter, are some of those, the high cost or lower margin parts, still in that inventory and do you expect to work them through in the course of the first quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, I mean, if we had a cost issue, it means the parts aren\u2019t there. It means that they were written off, so no, they\u2019re not in that inventory. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks. \nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our progress for Q1. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

I will now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.Today we are pleased to report record revenue, record net income, and recordgross margin. This is also our first billion dollar quarter. For our third quarter, revenue grew approximately 19%sequentially from Q2 and 36% from last year to a record $1.12 billion. GAAP netincome increased more than 121% year over year and GAAP gross margin improvedby 550 basis points from a year ago to a record 46.2%. Let me review some of our recent achievements. As the firstGPU company to reach the billion dollar quarter level, NVIDIA continues to beone of the fastest growing semiconductor companies in the world. Our GeForcedesktop and notebook GPU product lines each achieved record revenue. Thedesktop GPU product line grew 33% year over year and the notebook GPU productline grew 120% from last year. Our standalone notebook GPU share grew to 72%, up from 52% ayear ago. In September, we shipped our first ever single-chipmotherboard GPU for Inter processor based desktop PCs, the NVIDIA GeForce 7000GPU family. The GeForce 7000 family delivers the performance of an entry leveldiscrete GPU and leading graphics compatibilities when compared againsttraditional integrated graphic solutions. We estimate the Intel segmentrepresents approximately 40 million units of new addressable market opportunitynext year and expect it to be a strong growth driver for our GeForcemotherboard GPU business. In October, we launched the new GeForce 8800 GT GPU, thefirst in our family of 65-nanometer desktop GPUs. The 8800 GT combinesbest-of-gaming performance and best in HD playback at the $199 price point.Reviewers are calling the 8800 GT the next GeForce 4 TI4200. The TI4200 wascalled the perfect GPU at its time because it was simultaneously modern, highperformance, and well-priced. The TI4400 was one of the most successfulproducts in our history. The widely recognized tech website, AnandTech, wrote: \u201cIt\u2019sreally not often that we have the pleasure to review such a product soimpressively positioned. The 8800 GT is a terrific part and is hitting thestreet at a terrific price. The performance advantage and price utterlydestroys our perception of the GPU landscape.\u201d Our Quadro Professional Solutions business achieved recordrevenue and grew 37% year over year. During the quarter, we launched seven newQuadro solutions and most notably, the Quadro FX 370 and 570, which deliver ISBcertified hardware at sub $200 price points. The computer aided design industry is undergoing a massivetransition from 2D illustration to worldwide collaborative 3D design, and couldrepresent tens of millions of new CAD seats over the coming years. We believe the FX 370 and 570 are ideal solutions for theentry-level designer and we\u2019ll continue to accelerate our growth in theprofessional solutions segment. And finally, we began shipments of the Tesla C870 GPUcomputing processor and the 870 desk side super computer products this quarter.The adoption of Tesla and the CUDA C language programming environment and toolsuite continues to accelerate. We believe we now have more than 3,600developers and 14 industry categories working with CUDA on excitingapplications ranging from automotive visions systems, biological simulations,computational fluid dynamics, seismic processing and imaging, speech synthesis,computational finance, quantum molecular dynamics, protein folding to computervision. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financialresults in more detail. I will return in a moment to discuss our businesses andgrowth drivers for Q4 and beyond.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Today we\u2019ll be looking at both GAAP andnon-GAAP results for our Q3 and nine months ended October 28, 2007. The onlydifference between GAAP and non-GAAP is stock-based compensation and its taxeffect. As Jen-Hsun stated earlier, revenue for the third quarterwas $1.12 billion, which is up 19% quarter to quarter and up 36% year to year.Obviously it was a very strong quarter, and our concerns at the beginning ofthe quarter as to the sustainability of the strength we saw in Q2 nevermanifested. Also at the beginning of the quarter, there were concernsrelated to production limitations. Through the efforts of our partners and ouroperation staff, we were able to overcome most of those limitations. In a few cases, our revenue was limited by production butrelative to our concerns at the beginning of the quarter, these were minor. In our GPU business, the growth was led by notebook, whichgrew 41% quarter to quarter and 120% year to year. The desktop business grew14% over the second quarter and was up 33% over the prior year. In the quarter,GeForce 8X products accounted for more than 80% of our desktop and notebookbusiness. Our MCP business grew 23% quarter to quarter, as we begin tosee traction in our new Intel platform products. PSB, our workstation business, grew 20% over the secondquarter and 37% over the prior year. Even our consumer business grew 6% overQ2. All in all, there was strong growth in all segments. On gross margins, we reported GAAP gross margin of 46.2%,which is up 90 basis points from Q2. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46.4%. We hadanticipated strong gross margin based on the growth in GeForce 8X products, theincrease in professional solutions, and the increase in PlayStation 3royalties. All of these contributed to the increase in gross margin. We are again pleased with our progress. Operating expenses were $268 million GAAP and $238 millionnon-GAAP. This was slightly higher than our guidance. A major factor in thisincrease was the improved performance and outlook for the whole fiscal year andhow that affected our variable compensation programs. For the quarter, we had to accrue an additional $8 millionas a catch-up based on the increased financial performance and expectations.This is a one-time catch-up. We ended the quarter with 4,609 employees, which is up 236from the second quarter, as we continue to aggressively higher, particularly onR&D. One-hundred-and-fifty-five of the 236 new employees were in R&D. Depreciation for the quarter was $33 million and capitalexpenditures were $70.4 million. The increase in capital expenditures can beattributed to two factors. We bought additional testers of $22 million. Thesetesters are consigned to our contractors in Asia for the increased production.We also purchased some land for $27 million in anticipation of buildingadditional space. Interest and other income was $19 million in the quarter,and the tax rate was adjusted down to 12% for the year-to-date. This resultedin a tax rate for the third quarter of 11.7%. This slight downward adjustmentresults from more international sales than anticipated, as well as higherR&D tax credits. On the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities endedthe quarter at $1.85 billion, which is an increase of $281 million from thesecond quarter, despite repurchasing $125 million of stock during the quarter. Operating cash flow hit $400 million in the quarter for thefirst time. Accounts receivable were $552 million, an increase of only $44million from the second quarter as the even profile of shipments during thequarter helped collections. DSO for the quarter was 45 days, down from 50 days in Q2. Inventory grew slightly to $306 million in spite of thestrong sales and production limitations. Most of the increase can be attributedto new products that were not introduced until after the end of the quarter.DSI for the quarter was 46 days. On the outlook, we\u2019ve had two consecutive excellent quarterswhere revenue has exceeded our expectations. Even with this, we currently seestrong demand for our products and as a result, we expect revenue to grow inour fourth quarter. Revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range would be within ourexpectations. We expect our growth to be led by the continued strength inGPUs and new products in both GPUs and MCP. For gross margin, we\u2019ve made excellent progress and we\u2019llwork very hard to maintain our gross margin. New products will help but we arecurrently ahead of our plan and -- currently ahead of our plan in our progress. Operating expenses will increase in the fourth quarterdespite the catch-up that occurred in the third quarter. This increase is theresult of additional hiring and increased R&D expenses associated with newproducts. A total operating expense increase in the 3% to 5% is reasonable. We would expect the tax rate to stay close to our 13% but ifthere is any adjustment, it would have a downward bias. In summary, we expect an excellent Q4. I\u2019ll now turn it backover to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. We are entering the era of visual computing.Some of the most exciting applications required a GPU for the best experience.Industry expert PWC estimates the world wide videogame market to be $30 billionin size and expects the market to grow to $50 billion by 2010. According to ComScore, 217 million videogamers immersethemselves in online virtual worlds and expect that number to grow 17%annually. To date, there has been over 200 million unique downloads ofGoogle Earth. SketchUp makes it easy for millions of users around the world toconvert Google Earth into a full 3D world. Microsoft has shipped 85 millionunits of Vista and Apple\u2019s new Leopard looks amazing and is a step forward inUI design. Both demand GPU to deliver the best experience. Our computing experience is increasingly enhanced by theGPU. As the largest GPU company and the world\u2019s leading visual computingcompany, we are very well-positioned to continue to lead this revolution. Near term, we see multiple growth drivers. First, GeForcediscrete GPU -- GeForce GPU grew to 21 million units in Q3, up 30% from a yearago. The combination of our technology leadership, great content support, andthe ever-increasing importance of the GPU in our computing experience arecontributing to drive our growth. We estimate the installed base of GeForce tobe approximately 200 million units. That makes GeForce the largest game consolecommunity and a target-rich environment for game and application developers. We believe the PC game market is continuing to grow. Ouroverall enthusiast GPU segment grew 35% year over year. The GPU enthusiast GPUmarket grew 170%. Our strategy is to make GeForce one of the most importantprocessors of the visual computing era through technology leadership,increasing programmability, great content experience, and promoting our greatbrands. Second, GeForce motherboard GPU -- GeForce motherboard GPUsgrew to 10 million units per quarter, up 50% from a year ago. The GeForce 7000is off to a great start. We are now the only chipset supplier to support bothIntel and AMD processor platforms, and the only branded integrated GPU supplierfor the Intel processor platform. The integrated graphics opportunity represents approximately60% of the world\u2019s PC market. Our strategy is to bring the benefits of GeForceto the most sensitive price segments while creating exciting platformarchitectures like SLI, hybrid SLI, and ESA. ESA, which was recently announced, stands for enthusiastsystem architecture. It\u2019s a standard for system information protocol that linksthe systems various critical components, such as fan, power supply, smartchassis, GPU cards, and motherboards. It enables a unified architecture forapplications and users to control and optimize performance of their system. SLI, hybrid SLI, and ESA are examples of how NVIDIA createsarchitectures that advance the capabilities of the PC. Third, global proliferation of industrial design is drivingQuadro growth -- NVIDIA's Quadro brand is the de facto standard for [inaudible]visualization. Quadro is not just a GPU. Quadro is a professional class of GPUsthat incorporate features demanded by creative professionals, as well assoftware that completes a solution need for each vertical market, whether auto,medical imaging, film, or financial markets. We are experiencing multiply simultaneous dynamics in theprofessional market. Traditional 2D design and illustration is transitioning tocollaborative 3D design and product lifecycle management. Globalization isforcing multi-side design teams around the world to adopt common platforms, andis fostering the growth of local industries in China and in India. All thesedynamics are expanding the workstation TAM. Fourth, GPU computing with CUDA and Tesla -- CUDA is a dataparallel programming environment build on C. CUDA runs on all the millions ofG80 based and beyond GPUs, whether Quadro, GeForce, or Tesla. Tesla is the brand of GPU software systems solutions that istargeted at the high-performance computing market. The initial adoption ofTesla will be inclusion into super-computing clusters. Next year, we should seedesk side personal super-computing workstations powered by Tesla for dataparallel super-computing and Quadro for interactive visualization. And with CUDA on GeForce, we will quickly reach 100 millionunit per year run-rate for CUDA powered GPUs for the consumer market. Forconsumers, CUDA on GeForce will enhance applications like video and imageprocessing and physics processing for games. CUDA is one of the most revolutionary and disruptive ideasfrom our company. CUDA has ignited interest on GPU computing all of the world.There is growing understanding that the data parallel architecture of a GPU isradically different than that of a CPU and for a large class ofcompute-intensive data parallel applications, the GPU can increase performancefrom 10 to several hundred times. Fifth, we expect our first application processor to sampleat the beginning of next year. We believe another personal computer revolutionis about to happen. Mobile devices like phones, music players and portablenavigation devices will all increasingly become multi-function, multi-taskingpersonal computers. If so, the architecture of these devices will increasinglybecome consumer PC like and be capable of delivering all the entertainment andweb experiences we enjoy on a PC today but in the form factor that fits nicelyin your hands. Our mobile strategy is to drive the second personal computerrevolution by creating a from the ground up application processor and system ona chip that enables this experience. AP15, as it is called internally, is the culmination ofseveral hundred man years of R&D. The mobile application processor is anarea where we can add a tremendous amount of value and represents a severalhundred million units a year growth opportunity. We are happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from theline of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.\nHans Mosesmann -Raymond James: Hello, can you hear me? Congratulations, guys. A quickquestion; the GeForce 7000 motherboard GPU, what kind of average selling priceare we talking about here, and are they consistent with the average sellingprices of the A&B platform version?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The ASPs on the MCP73 or the GeForce 7000 is slightly higheron the Intel side, but it should be targeted -- we are targeting that productto be in the mainstream price sensitive segment so that we can bring GeForce toas many people as possible. That\u2019s a rather large segment and we think itrepresents about 40 million units of incremental opportunity for us next year.\nHans Mosesmann -Raymond James: Is that a $50 ASP, a $100 ASP? I just want to get a generalsense of the magnitude.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh no, it\u2019s in the teens. It\u2019s designed to be on themotherboard. It\u2019s intended to be in the teens and we want it to be asaffordable as possible so that we can address the largest possible marketsegments.\nHans Mosesmann -Raymond James: Okay, great. That\u2019s it. Thanks a lot and congratulations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Poon fromThomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead.\nHeidi Poon - ThomasWeisel Partners: Hello? Can you hear me?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes.\nHeidi Poon - ThomasWeisel Partners: Can you describe what you expect further for notebooks? Iknow the general trend of desktop to notebook transition is still there, butmost of your wins have been indiscrete. As AMD and Intel come up with theirintegrated graphics platform, also supporting DX10, where do you think you cantake your market share gains to next year and after that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it\u2019s really hard to say what our market share will bein the future but we\u2019ve been competing against integrated graphics for quite along time and our ability to succeed will depend on continuing to do the typeof things that we do well, which is come up with great ideas, like SLI andhybrid SLI, and bring value to the marketplace like we do with GeForce andQuadro. So we\u2019re going to continue to do those things and if we do our jobswell, we should continue to grow and if we don\u2019t, then obviously thecompetition will do better.\nHeidi Poon - ThomasWeisel Partners: But do you think you might have a disadvantage because ofthe power consumption factor?\nJen-Hsun Huang: How is their integrated graphics lower power consumptionthan ours? In fact, I think that you know, probably, that NVIDIA's G8Xarchitecture is the most efficient performance per watt GPU in the marketplacetoday and that explains why we\u2019re able to get our enthusiast level GPUs into asingle slot with a single slot fan, why our fan noise is substantially lowerand obviously our measured power to be substantially lower. That\u2019s somethingyou can do with architecture, that\u2019s something you can do with innovativecircuit design techniques, and so on and so forth, and system technologies tomanage it at the system level. So there are all kinds of competitive capabilities for us toinnovate and power and we believe we are absolutely world class in that area.\nHeidi Poon - ThomasWeisel Partners: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster fromJ.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.\nShawn Webster - J.P.Morgan: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you give anupdate -- I mean, a lot of folks, especially investors in the PC chip relatedcompanies, are concerned on linearity, risk of double ordering, have thingsbeen too good for too long -- can you guys share with us some of your thoughts?I think Marv, you had some comments on linearity. Maybe you could talk about orderlinearity as the quarter progressed, how your backlog looks, and any risk thatyou can tell in terms of doubleordering?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Our Q3 was one of the most linear that we\u2019ve had. Thestrength that we saw in orders in Q2 continued straight through Q3, and so ifyou wanted to look at a backlog, we are not a backlog focused type company butthere was no change. The orders and the shipments were ratable all the waythrough. Obviously you are always concerned about is there any double ordering goingon, but we don\u2019t see the evidence of that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The way I would -- the way I think through that problem isfirst of all, we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and obviously nobody does. Andthe marketplace is rather robust, and I think it\u2019s rather robust for us for avariety of reasons. I think the -- first of all is new products always helps,and the 8800 GT is arguably the best product that NVIDIA has built in fiveyears. That\u2019s what everybody is telling us, that\u2019s how we feel about it, and wehave very, very big hopes for it. We have MPC73, which is our first product of that categoryand bringing GeForce to the Intel motherboard is pretty exciting stuff, and theearly adoption has been wonderful. Both of those products we just can\u2019t make enough of, andthere are good reasons for their growth. I think overall, the GPU dynamic ispretty clear now, that PC games, online games is one of the fastest growingapplication sectors. Vista is doing well. Leopard is amazing. There are moreand more applications that in combination with a GPU is just a betterexperience. And then we have new innovations like Tesla and CUDA, andthere is a very logical reason why there is industrial growth in design. Whenwe globalize the China and India and other Eastern European countries and wecollaborate across the network and we design 24 hours a day, it makes perfectsense that you would need compatible workstations all over the world. And simultaneously, some of these economies are no longerjust manufacturing economies but they are moving into design economies, and soas you know, China is moving very, very quickly up the food chain and more andmore unique designs are coming out of China. Well, they need workstations forthat. I think if you combine whether it\u2019s new products that we areintroducing in the market that we serve today, the importance of the GPU, newindustry growth form workstations, or a new disruptive technology that we\u2019vecreated with Tesla and CUDA -- those are all important reasons why we are growing.\nShawn Webster - J.P.Morgan: Thank you. You guys mentioned that you had a couple of areasthat were still tight from a capacity perspective. Could you share with us whatareas those are?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Jen-Hsun just mentioned a couple of them; MCP73 and some ofour GeForce 8 products were capacity limited or production limited in thequarter.\nShawn Webster - J.P.Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from theline of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much. I just wanted to get a better sense onyour Q4 guidance; how much of that is based on your expectations for furthershare gains versus the end market growth for other factors, such as potentiallyASP increases?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t count on share growth. That happens after you aredone counting it and so -- unless it\u2019s a design win or whatever it is that weknow, we don\u2019t typically count on share growth. So we count -- we look at thestrategic position of our products, we look at the new products that we\u2019reintroducing and therefore we\u2019ve got some confidence on its pricing power. Wecount on new markets that we are entering opening up and so we count on avariety of things. And of course, OEM design wins are OEM design wins, butotherwise we try not to be too bullish on market share wins.\nMarvin D. Burkett: We also don\u2019t anticipate any changes in ASPs in the variousmarket segments. That\u2019s not [ending growth].\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, so it sounds like a lot of it is just the end marketcontinues to be very robust.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. And we are entering new markets and we are creating newproducts for existing markets as well. So those are -- when somebody -- when westarted to ship Tesla, that\u2019s a product that\u2019s one of its -- it\u2019s the first ofits kind and it adds so much value and the people that buy it initially arepeople who are desperate to have more computing resources. Products like the 8800 GT, it\u2019s an existing market that weserve but it\u2019s very disruptive because of its price performance is just soterrific and it really promotes very, very quick adoption and oftentimes iteven encourages pretty broad-based upgrades. And you know that there\u2019s a whole bunch of games coming outthis Christmas with DX10 and the games look really terrific, so -- so there\u2019sjust a lot of reasons why the GPU is doing well.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: I appreciate that color. Just one other question that issomewhat related; you mentioned that you think the motherboard GPU is anincremental 40 million unit opportunity. These products seem to be competingvery effectively against the low end of the discrete GPU market and seem tohave a significantly lower price point. So do you view this as an incremental opportunity or do youview this to some extent as asubstitution of some of the existing stack of the product?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The GeForce 7000 really isn\u2019t high performance enough to bea replacement for even our entry level GPU, so that\u2019s not -- and you know ourdiscrete GPU, as one of the data points that Marv just mentioned, our discreteGPU will be vastly converted to DX10 very, very shortly. So this is reallytargeting the segment that\u2019s underneath it, the 60% of the marketplace that wedon\u2019t really serve today.\nSimona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gurinder Kalra withBear Stearns. Please go ahead.\nGurinder Kalra - BearStearns: Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on theGeForce 8800 GT. It\u2019s a great product but do you think there is any chance itmight be cannibalizing some other very high priced products? And given that it\u2019s priced around $200, $249 but on65-nanometer, how does it affect your gross margins going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we always try to be thoughtful about how our productscan cannibalize their own products, but I think we understand this marketpretty well and if it\u2019s possible to cannibalize our products, well, I\u2019d ratherdo it myself than wait around for somebody else to come and do it, and so I\u2019mnot too worried about that. That\u2019s just really the nature of our business andwe have to stay aggressive. We want to stay aggressive and we want to bring asmuch as we can to the market. I\u2019m not inclined really to slow down because it somehowprotects my own business. My own business will have to figure out a way to dealwith my own business. So that\u2019s our strategy there, nice and simple. But I thinkour high-end products will continue to be best of its kind, best of its class,and I think the market will be fine there.\nMarvin D. Burkett: As far as margins go, the margins on the 8800 GT areexcellent, well above corporate margins.\nGurinder Kalra - BearStearns: Thanks. Just a follow-up question on the general purposeGPU/Tesla, can you discuss some of the traction or the design wins you areseeing in the financial services industry and the headway you made there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There is a lot of development going on using GPU computingfor computational finance. As you guys know, your industry has some of thebrightest mathematicians in the world and the amount of computation you guysneed is completely unbounded. You just don\u2019t seem to be able to get a largeenough server or enough of them. We\u2019ve demonstrated that GPU can be used to acceleratefinancial computational finance by 10 times, 20 times, and severalapplications, 50 to 100 times. And that\u2019s a very, very large step up inperformance improvement, and so there\u2019s quite a bit of development in thatarea. It\u2019s happening all over the world. It\u2019s happening in London. It\u2019shappening in New York. This is an area that I think is going to be prettyinteresting for GPU computing.\nGurinder Kalra - BearStearns: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael McConnellof Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks. On the G92 or the 8800 GT, when are you expectingcrossover on that, relative to the 8800 GTS?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Crossover -- let me --\nMichaelMcConnell - Pacific Crest Securities:\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me explain it this way. I think this will do it. We willship more 8800 GTs this quarter then we shipped last quarter of 8800 GTS. [Multiple Speakers]\nJen-Hsun Huang: Go ahead.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: I\u2019m sorry to interrupt -- this will be -- would you say thisis probably your most aggressive ramp in history, maybe of a product?\nJen-Hsun Huang: This is one of our most aggressive ramps and the reason forthat is because it is such a great product. We have a really rich backlog oforders for 8800 GT. And although the market now knows what the competition hasand our customers know what the competition has and they are voting with theirorders. We are going to be very, very aggressive with 8800 GT. It\u2019sjust such a great product. Five years ago we had the 4200TI, TI4200 and themarket called it the perfect GPU. And the reason for that was because it was abrand new architecture, it was extremely high performance, and it was veryaffordable. It was $199 and it lit that segment on fire and it was -- wecouldn\u2019t build enough of that 4200 for a very long time. We think we\u2019ve got another 4200 on our hands and certainlythe market has effectively called it that.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: I guess -- I know you don\u2019t -- it\u2019s tough to predict marketshare. You guys have obviously dominated this segment in the high-end. With the-- could you talk about just the basis for having such an aggressive ramp? Imean, do you really feel like you could take more market share, or is this justyou are ramping in accordance to the demand out there, which is quite strong?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There\u2019s always competition in our space. This is one of the-- the GPU industry is one of the most vibrant industries and the reason forthat has to do with the fact that Moore\u2019s Law is still GPU\u2019s friend, or GPU isstill Moore Law\u2019s friend. This is one of the few technology segments left wheremore transistors and new algorithms and new technology could enable betterexperiences. Almost all of the other semiconductor sectors are seeing smallerdie sizes every year and lower ASPs every year, but not the case with the GPU. I expect this to be an area of quite a bit of vibrance for adecade to come. In terms of how quickly we ramp, that\u2019s just the way we dothings. We need to bring out new architectures and we need to bring it out asbroadly as we can because as soon as we launch one unit of 8800 GT, everybodyin the world is going to want it and so you might as well assume that you are buildingfor everybody in the world and so that\u2019s kind of the approach that we take. And we want to stay aggressive as a company. That\u2019s just ournature.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: And then a final question, just on the GeForce 7 series chipsetsfor Intel\u2019s platforms, can you talk about the early traction you are seeing,both at OEMs and then maybe separately in the channel, and just how that\u2019sprogressing and the outlook, if you have one, for next year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re expecting to be every successful with OEMs as well asthe channel, and so it\u2019s designed -- it\u2019s designed to -- NVIDIA's brand and thequality of our technology and the rich support that we offer in drivers, as theindustry gets more complex with DX10s and OpenGLs and high definition videosand all of these different applications, our software capability becomes anincreasing advantage. And just because it\u2019s integrated on the motherboarddoesn\u2019t mean the software isn\u2019t complex. That\u2019s an area that we are extremely good at, and so it\u2019s --my sense is that we will be very successful in both OEMs and the channel. Andyou\u2019ll see it soon.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, and Marv, have you guys thrown out a target for nextyear within that business, or just quantified what the opportunity could be fornext year? I don\u2019t know if you have or have not.\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, we have not.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: Would you care to, or --\nMarvin D. Burkett: Only it\u2019s a significant growth driver next year, but no, wehaven\u2019t quantified it.\nMichael McConnell -Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayyib Shah withLongbow Research. Please go ahead.\nTayyib Shah - LongbowResearch: Congratulations on the quarter. The notebook market has beendoing very well lately, but maybe partly at the expense of the desktop segment,where you have higher exposure. Can you help us understand how desktopreplacement by notebooks is likely to affect your business going forward, nowthat you already have 70%-plus share in notebooks?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The notebook market is certainly doing very well and Iexpect that one of the areas where the notebook market is just starting to seegrowth but it will see a lot more growth in the coming years is the gamingnotebook segment, and the mobile workstation segment. These two segments aregrowing very quickly and I expect that we\u2019ll be able to add a lot of value tothose two platforms in the future. We\u2019re not too hung up about where people buy our GPUs. We\u2019redelighted by the proliferation of platforms and whereas people typically tendto have one or two PCs, desktop PCs in their house, they may have four, and inmy case eight, laptops at home. It\u2019s a little bit like a cellphone, I guess andyou just buy a whole bunch of them over time. I think that the notebook market is not completely areplacement market, frankly. I think that a lot of it is an additive market andcertainly it has exceeded most people\u2019s expectations.\nTayyib Shah - LongbowResearch: Another question along the same lines, as your footprintwithin the notebook market has grown, have you been finding this market morecompetitive than your discrete GPU business, given that in this business, Intelcan bundle their chipsets with their CPUs, if they want to?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Intel is definitely a very competitive company and we are --we\u2019ve been competing against bundling for quite some time, whether it\u2019s pricebundling or other bundling. The bottom line is we just have to add value. We just haveto add value. NVIDIA is not a commodity player and we serve the marketplaceswhere we could -- where visual computing is really important. If 3D matters toyou, and if your work matters to you and you do 3D work, whether it\u2019s in designor film or medical imaging, then we could add a lot of value to you. And ifyour business really depends on having a great GPU and visual computingcapability, I think NVIDIA is really your partner.\nTayyib Shah - LongbowResearch: Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from theline of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nPeter Karzaris -Citigroup: This is Peter [Karzaris] for Glen Yeung. A question just onASPs; I was wondering if on a mixed basis, your ASPs were able to improve indesktops and notebooks from second to third quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, they were relatively flat.\nPeter Karzaris -Citigroup: Despite mix? And then on -- I noticed margins were up andyou talked about I think royalties from Sony as being one of the drivers. Butconsumer revenue was up about 6%. I was wondering if you could give us anyother color around consumer revenue and then also, if you could just help usunderstand maybe the total impact that that had on, that royalties had on grossmargin improvement?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, you know, any increase in royalties is 100% grossmargin, so I would say that our royalty income from PS3 increased significantlyfrom Q2 to Q3. It more than doubled, so that had an impact on our grossmargins. Was it the driving factor? Probably not, but it was one of the factorsthat improved gross margins. The fact that that increase would probably account for mostof the increase in the consumer business is probably true.\nPeter Karzaris -Citigroup: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBSInvestment Bank. Please go ahead.\nUche Orji - UBS: Can I just get a sense of where the professional servicesbusiness will go next quarter? I mean, I see your guidance and your[inaudible], but that division is pretty critical for driving overall grossmargin, so if you can give us some color as to what we should expect withinthat division next quarter, that would be helpful. And a second question is about your handset strategy. Iunderstand your push on the apps processor direction, but do you see the lackof a baseline solution as something that could become a problem for theapplication of that strategy? If you can give me some color, that would behelpful. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess on the first one, we really haven\u2019t and we don\u2019tgive too much granular guidance at the business unit level. All I can tell youis that the professional solutions group is doing well and they arestrategically very well-positioned and they add a lot of value to themarketplace. Our business of -- what some people call the workstationsbusiness, what we call the professional solutions business is really acombination of technology, GPU technology and a lot of software, systemcomponent technology, and expertise. We have one -- we have one of the, if notmy expectation to be the largest developer technology organization in the worldand we help inspire and we help solve some of the most challenging visualcomputing problems in the world through that organization. So I expect it to do well. We haven\u2019t really given it muchguidance. With respect to our application processor business, we aregoing to focus on the segments of the handheld marketplace where computing isparticularly important. If you take a look at all the handhelds in the world,really with the exception of the iPhone, every other phone in the world wantsto be a computer but has a long way to go. And this is where we could add a lotof value. NVIDIA is fundamentally a computer technology company. Weare one of the world\u2019s largest computer technology companies and there are veryfew consumer oriented computing platforms where we can\u2019t, from the ground up,design an entire computer for you. So this is an area that we could add a lot of value. We areseeing a lot of interest in the work that we are doing and when I said severalyears ago that this is going to be the second personal computer revolution andthat the phone is going to become a computer first and a phone second, at thetime it sounded kind of odd but I think it makes a lot of sense now.\nUche Orji - UBS: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from theline of Daniel Ernst from Hudson Square Research. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research: Thanks for taking the call. Two, if I might; first, on themainstream growth and maybe also the low end of the discrete, obviously in thedomestic market, so much enthusiasm around digital video and high resolutionphotography with things like YouTube and digital SLRs, and so that\u2019s about --and the uptake of Premium Vista, I assume that that\u2019s been a lot of the growththere. But can you talk about that same market overseas where so much more ofthe overall PC market growth is, and particularly in developing countries like Indiaand China whereI assume the market is more price sensitive. And then secondly on the mobile phone business, you gave usa little bit of mapping for the app processor, but can you just give us alittle bit of color about the current mobile phones business and how that istracking, relative to expectations? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say that the developing markets are being drivenright now by online games, which is really a craze in China and India and theonline game market is really doing fabulously out there. Games are free and youpay for the service and you pay as you go, and it\u2019s a really great way for themto meet their friends and meet people on the web. So those -- that\u2019s a real growth driver. Another one, ofcourse, is their purchasing power in the foreign countries are becoming quitegood and as a result, they can buy up on their configurations. And one of thebest ways to improve your experience to buy up on the configuration is to add aGPU. Those factors are quite important growth drivers for us internationally,irrespective of Vista. Internationally, Vista is doing well everywhere. I don\u2019tthink it\u2019s not doing well in China. I frankly think that it is doing very wellin China and it will do very well in India as well. Any consumer will [enjoy]Vista. With respect to the application processors, the handheldbusiness, we haven\u2019t shipped much application processors. We haven\u2019t shippedany of our AP15 yet, so all of our current handheld business is from theexisting handheld GPU business, which met expectations. It\u2019s not intended togrow and it\u2019s likely to continue to decline. This quarter I think it declinedbut we are not expecting that business to grow because we are not out trying toget anymore design wins. We are really focusing now on building our applicationprocessor and this is where we are going to drive the market.\nDaniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research: Do you see a bit of an air pocket then between the currentgen, the mobile GPU that you have now and the integrated app processor?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, not really, mainly because it\u2019s not significant portionof our business right now.\nDaniel Ernst - HudsonSquare Research: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho fromMerrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho - MerrillLynch: Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a question on grossmargin. You are at 46.2% this quarter and I\u2019m not going to ask for specificguidance, but if you look forward say for the next 12 months, what are some ofthe biggest endeavors that can improve margins, both at the gross and operatingmargin level? Is it more like a product mix between chipsets, [GPU Tesla] orbetween product families like the G92, or is there something else?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019ve not increased our gross margins by raising pricesonce, and the reason for that is because it\u2019s hard to grow while you areraising prices. And so we remain very competitive in the marketplace. Where we\u2019ve improved all of our gross margins is internaloperational improvements. And I\u2019ll tell you that I have a lot of work left todo, so -- there are quite a bit of -- just the things that we can do inside,all within the walls of our company, we have many, many ideas on improvinggross margins through better operations, better execution.\nMarvin D. Burkett: The mix will affect gross margins, depending on where thegrowth comes from. But having said that, our total focus is improving the grossmargins on each of the business segments, and Jen-Hsun is right; there\u2019s lotsof things that we could do better so I still see room for gross marginimprovement in each of the businesses.\nSidney Ho - MerrillLynch: One follow-up question; for the professional services group,can you tell us how did the average selling price do for the quarter? And also,if you can tell us how much was the contribution from Tesla during the quarter,which I don\u2019t expect much, that would be great. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Tesla was very little. It\u2019s just beginning to ship, so it\u2019svery little. And we\u2019re expecting it to be small relative to the overall size ofthe company in its first year. The most important thing about Tesla is targeting it at thetype of applications where they can really use the help right away, whetherit\u2019s oil and gas or imaging, medical imaging, or computational finance. Thereare all kinds of applications out there that could really benefit from it.Meanwhile, we are driving CUDA, which is the programming environment, into allof our GPUs so that we can bring GPU computing to the masses. Both of those efforts are ongoing and I frankly think thatthe progress is extremely high and better than we had expected by far, by a lot.\nMarvin D. Burkett: As far as the ASPs go, ASPs are in the hundreds of dollars.They are not -- it gets to be a complex mix of products there, so let me justsay it\u2019s hundreds of dollars.\nSidney Ho - MerrillLynch: So was it up from last quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No, relatively flat.\nSidney Ho - MerrillLynch: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Aberlefrom Caris & Company. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Good afternoon. Nice quarter, guys. Question had to do withASPs; I know we talked about ASPs here in the most recent quarter. You guyshave done a great job over the last couple of years in improving those. What isthe expectation over time for ASPs? Do we have a substantial move higher fromcurrent levels based on Tesla?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The way we think about ASPs here, the way I think about ASPsis we have to make the GPU more valuable. The more programmable we make it andthe more applications take advantage of it, the more people will spend inbuying GPUs because it will enhance our computing experience. Now that trend has been moving very aggressively over thelast couple of years, with all of the applications that I\u2019ve already talkedabout and the growth of the gaming market and amazing applications like GoogleEarth and Microsoft\u2019s Virtual Earth 3D. These types of applications are justcontinuing to make the GPU more important and so that\u2019s our focus. My expectation is absolutely the GPU ASP will continue toincrease, and the reason for that is because I expect to make it more valuableand people will see the value and hopefully choose to buy a better GPU.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Perfect. Looking back over the last couple of years, youguys have refreshed the halo product, the enthusiast desktop product abouttwice a year, it looks like every fall and spring. You guys just did 8800 Ultraback in the spring. Should we be expecting another enthusiast refresh herebefore the end of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we are at the end of the year and -- we decided thatthe refresh that we would do this time was 8800 GT, and this is just a barnburner refresh. We are really, really proud of the 8800 GT and we are going toput our focus here. From 8800 GT, you could obviously do SLI and soon you\u2019ll beable to do three-way SLI, so you are going to be able to put a lot of GPUhorsepower into your system, starting with a very affordable 8800 GT, and so --this is our focus for now.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: I\u2019ll just sneak one more question in; Intel back inSeptember bought a small company called Havoc, does acceleration, physicsacceleration software. Just was wondering if you guys are in the market forthat IP. I know you guys have worked with them in the past and how that maybehas an effect on the longer term landscape.\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, no current plans.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: But no commentary regarding how their purchase of Havocaffects maybe their IP positioning relative to yours in physics acceleration?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh, I didn\u2019t know that was the question you asked. You askedme about my plans. I don\u2019t have any plans. I don\u2019t know why they bought Havoc. Physics is -- physicsprocessing has a long ways to go and there are so many companies out there.There\u2019s quite a few -- quite a few middleware companies out there that arecreating technology in this area, and many gamers, many game developersincorporate their own physics engine. So my sense is that there\u2019s a lot ofinvention still left to do in this area. I\u2019m not sure why they bought thatcompany, to tell you the truth. It might give them some advantages with respectto Havoc but it obviously creates negative synergies everywhere else. But that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t know why they did it, and so you\u2019reasking really the wrong person. Strategically, I don\u2019t know that it has anyreal bearing on the work that we are doing.\nNicholas Aberle - Caris & Company: Thanks. Good luck in Q4, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no more questions at this time. I wouldnow like to turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you. NVIDIA's strategy is to be the world leader invisual computing by leading the GPU revolution while creating innovativetechnologies that enable and inspire amazing applications. The GPU is increasingly central to our computing experienceand although hundreds of millions of users already enjoy 3D applications andUIs like Vista and Leopard, this is just the tip of the iceberg of thepotential of the GPU. We intend to drive our growth by continuing to extend theGPU to more applications, more platforms, and to more people. Thank you forjoining us today. We look forward to reporting on our results for Q4.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference callfor today.

In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response, we will allow one follow-up question.  I would now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: [Gap in audio] revenue, record net income and record gross margin. For our second quarter, revenue grew 36% from last year to a record $935 million, and non-GAAP net income increased 77% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin improved to a record 45.6%, an increase of 290 basis points from a year ago. GAAP net income nearly doubled year over year, and GAAP gross margin improved by 280 basis points from a year ago to a record 45.3%. We achieved a record quarter despite Q2 being historically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year.  Let me highlight some of our achievements for Q2. The GeForce desktop and notebook product lines each achieved record revenue. The desktop GPU product line grew 37% year over year, and the notebook GPU product line grew 129% from last year. We continued to capture leading share in five categories. Total standalone GPU share grew to 66% from 48% a year ago. Total standalone desktop GPU share grew to 65% from 51% a year ago. Total standalone notebook GPU share grew to 68% from 37% a year ago. Our DirectX 9 generation share was 64% and DirectX 10 generation share was 75%.  During the quarter, we launched a new family of GeForce 8M series GPUs in support of the production ramp of nearly every notebook PC OEM in the world including Acer, Apple, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba. The global notebook PC segment continues to grow significantly faster than the overall PC market. We believe Q3 growth will continue its strong momentum.  In June, we launched Tesla, our entry into the high-performance computing industry. HPC Wire, the most recognized and accessed news and information site covering the entire ecosystem of high-performance computing, named Tesla as one of the most significant launches in the HPC industry in the first half of 2007. The Tesla family consists of the C870 GPU computing processor, the D870 desk-sized supercomputer and the S870 1U computing server. nForce 65i SLI powers the new maximum PC Dream Machine 2007. This is the third consecutive year nForce has been selected as its motherboard of choice by the number-one magazine for home computing enthusiasts. Maximum PC chose nForce 65i SLI because of its performance, its overclock ability with quad-core CPUs and SLI support. We introduced an entirely new line of notebook workstation GPU's based on G8X architecture, the NVIDIA Quadro FX 1600M, 570M and 360M.  Let me now turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results in more detail. I will return in a moment to discuss our business and growth drivers for Q3 and beyond. \nMarv Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Before I get started, I would like to apologize for the irritating coughing you may hear in the background. That's me. I'm fighting a little case of bronchitis so I apologize for that.  Today, we're reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP P&Ls for Q2 fiscal year 2008 and for the first six months of fiscal year 2008. The only difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is equity-based compensation and its tax effect. As mentioned, revenue for the second quarter was $935.3 million, which is up $91 million or 11% from the first quarter and up $248 million or 36% over the prior year. Obviously, strong revenue growth exceeded our guidance. The strength was primarily in the GPU business. While MCP grew $12 million or 8% quarter to quarter, we had expected this in our guidance. The strength in the GPU business included both desktop and notebook. In total, the GPU business grew 20% quarter to quarter.  Within the GPU business, notebook grew 50% quarter to quarter, as the Santa Rosa launch was well accepted. Much of the growth in desktop was in mainstream products. Year to year, GPU revenue was up 55% and MCP was up 16%. For the quarter, GAAP gross margin was 45.3%, which is up 30 basis points quarter to quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 45.6%, up 20 basis points quarter to quarter. With the very high growth we experienced in mainstream GPUs, we expected margin pressure, but we were able to overcome that with continued execution of the transition to GeForce 8X products and good operational execution.  Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $212.5 million, and within our guidance. The GAAP operating expenses were relatively flat quarter to quarter, as the total equity-based compensation dropped by approximately $8 million from the first quarter. We had expected this roll off due to several contributing factors, one of which is the transition from Black-Scholes to a binomial valuation model that we made several years ago.  During the quarter, we continue to hire and added 299 new employees. Two-thirds of the additions were in the R&D area. The tax rate stayed constant at 14%, and this resulted in GAAP earnings of $172.7 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings were $198.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share.  On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.57 billion in cash, even though we repurchased almost $125 million in stock. The operating cash flow was over $300 million for the second quarter in a row. Accounts receivable were $508 million, which generated days sales outstanding of 50 days. The fact that the quarter was more evenly loaded than expected helped with the reduction in days sales outstanding. Inventory was down $56 million to $276 million, and resulted in days sales in inventory of 49 days. In my opinion, this inventory level is too low.  Capital expenditures in the quarter were $30 million and depreciation was $32 million. Both for the quarter and year to date, capital expenditures and depreciation almost offset each other. There was not much else of significance on the balance sheet. I will also like to point out that today we announced a 3-for-2 stock split in the form of a stock dividend.  On the outlook, for the quarter, we're starting from a higher base, given our Q2 performance. Still, we expect revenue growth in most areas, particularly notebook and workstations. The result is we believe revenue will grow 5% to 7%. We believe there may be some product limitations, as manufacturing capacity is somewhat limited and our inventories are low.  For gross margins, we will work hard to continue to improve gross margins, and with the continued transition to GeForce 8X products and the expected increase in workstation revenue, we believe some improvement is possible.  For operating expenses, with our continued hiring and salary increases, we expect OpEx to also grow in the 5% to 7% range. We believe the tax rate will hold at 14%. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. Although Q2 is typically the weakest seasonal quarter for the industry, we experienced growth in desktop and notebook GPU and MCP. We are now heading into what are historically the two strongest quarters of the year, driven by back-to-school and holiday cycles. As we head into the seasonally strong second half, we will enjoy several dynamics that continue to enhance the importance of the GPU.  First, exciting DX 10 games are launching shortly. Crysis from EA is particularly exciting and will help drive GPU upgrades. Second, HD and Blu-ray disk drives continue to come down in price, and title availability is now plenty. Third, discrete GPU technology has advanced substantially relative to integrated graphics, creating a large technology gap between our discrete GPUs and high-volume integrated graphics chips at a time when the graphics demand from modern operating systems like Vista and OS 10 continue to increase. As a result, we expect to see the overall GPU segment to grow. Lastly, we have a strong position in both desktop as well as notebook, and believe we can continue to grow share.  At our analyst day in June, we announced several brand new growth areas and exciting new strategies. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss them again. First is the highly anticipated launch of our first motherboard GPU for Intel processors. Directly attached to the motherboard, our new products will bring the NVIDIA brand of GPUs to a new price point for Intel processor customers. This is a first for NVIDIA and an exciting new growth opportunity.  Second, we announced an exciting new technology called Hybrid SLI. Future motherboard GPUs and discrete GPUs will collaborate to enhance capabilities, performance as well as reducing power. We call it Hybrid because this technology combines a powerful as well as an energy-efficient engine; and SLI because this is our multi-GPU technology.  When GeForce N-cards are connected to GeForce motherboards, Hybrid SLI kicks in, combining their processing power to deliver an additive experience. The technology is application aware. Depending on the processing demands of each application, the discrete GPU may be completely shut down to save power. For the most powerful systems, where the combined power of dual GeForce 8800 GTX SLI can reach 400 watts, both GPUs can be powered down when the user is just doing e-mail, surfing the Web or watching a Blu-ray movie, keeping the system completely quiet and consuming the least possible energy. But when a game or other demanding GPU application is launched, the dual 8800 GTXs are powered up to deliver an immersive experience. For performance systems, Hybrid SLI will give users the benefit of energy efficiency, as well as uncompromising performance. For mainstream systems, Hybrid SLI will enhance the performance and features by combining the benefits of the motherboard and the add-in card GPU. Hybrid SLI will be available starting with our GeForce 8 series motherboard GPUs this fall.  Third, we announced Tesla, a new line of high-performance computing processors based on our revolutionary G8X GPU architecture. Tesla leverages the massive computational resources inherent in our GPUs, which can be over 100 times greater than the fastest microprocessor alone. This breakthrough innovation centers around technologies that will enable programmers to access this massive computational resource. The Tesla architecture and supporting C language compiler and development environment is called CUDA. The adoption of Tesla and CUDA has far exceeded my expectations.  We have known for some time that the world has a supercomputing crisis. The enthusiasm around Tesla is a reflection of this vacuum. Thousands of programmers worldwide are already creating parallel GPU programs using CUDA and Tesla. The Tesla family includes a GPU computing board, a Quadro Plex style desk-sized system and the world's first 1U GPU computing server. I believe Tesla and CUDA will represent one of the most significant technology discontinuities in the supercomputing industry since Cray introduced vector processing. We anticipate Tesla will enable fundamental new discoveries in a broad range of industries. Customers in the field of computational chemistry, neurological science, medicine and seismic processing have seen computation times reduced by as much as 5,000% using Tesla. Tesla is yet another example of the power of the GPU and its increasing impact on the computer and consumer electronics industry.  NVIDIA now has three major brands, GeForce for enjoyment, Quadro for creation and now Tesla for discovery. The diversity of our brands reflect the versatility and the importance of the GPU.  Let us now take your questions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from Arnab Chanda \u2013 Lehman Brothers. \n Arnab Chanda \u2013 Lehman Brothers : Obviously the performance in the graphics business has been superlative. Do you think any of this is other than, obviously, share gain? Are you seeing a Vista effect here? If so, what do you think? Is this the beginning of it, or how long do you think that continues? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, this can't be all share gain. It's very clear that the size of the GPU market is larger than several quarters ago. We can only attribute that to a variety of things which we think either falls into the category of Vista, as we know that Vista is becoming better and better, and consumer PC adoption is certainly very high with Vista. We know that the experience of Vista is significantly better with the GPU in your system.  We also believe that DX 10 applications and the new generation of video games are rather taxing, and it's because of the technology gap between the GPU and integrated graphics, the separation has become so large that it makes it clear that a GPU is better. Then the third reason is Blu-ray and high-definition video. I think all of these things are really playing together and helping the GPU market substantially. \n Arnab Chanda \u2013 Lehman Brothers : We think maybe we understand what's going on in the PC business and what kind of growth rate that would create. However, you have obviously had much better growth rates than that in the last three years, above 20%. I knew you don't want to give guidance. But for next year, what type of growth in non-PC segments, whether it's Tesla, whether it's your cell phone business, perhaps consumer or other things you haven't really talked about, how much can the add to your core business, your PC business growth? \nJen-Hsun Huang: The growth of our GPU business, whether it's discrete GPUs or motherboard GPUs, is a function of the growth rate of the PC. It's related to the share gains that we have, but it's also related to how much of the PC marketplace appreciates a GPU. NVIDIA's market share is about 30% in the overall GPU market and so there's still 60% of the PCs that can benefit from better GPUs. I think that, over time, as more and more of the computing experience is related to computer graphics and what you see on your display, and as the size of displays become larger and as the content that we see become richer, it's just evident that more and more people appreciate the GPU. So that's one factor.  With respect to going forward, how we think about the market, we think about the new markets that we enter as we grow. In the second half of this year, I just mentioned that we're going to bring our GeForce brand for the first time to motherboards for Intel processors. Hard to say exactly how big that marketplace is, but I think the overall market for core logic is somewhere between $6 billion to $8 billion, of which we have a relatively small part of that. So that's a growth opportunity for us.  We also look at the TAM of the application processors that we're building. We are entering into a marketplace that is in the process of transitioning from being a cell phone, a telephone, to being a mobile computer. We are targeting this discontinuity and building, effectively, a modern multimedia computer on a single chip. We call it an application processor. I think this is going to be a phenomenal opportunity for us, and one that we can add a lot of value to the industry, bringing computing expertise to the cell phone marketplace. That marketplace, it is hard to say exactly how big that's going to be, but it's many billion dollars large, as you know.  Tesla is probably the hardest of all to guess, and the reason for that is because it's the product that is the most disruptive, in terms of what it can do to the marketplace. It accelerates and certainly reduces the processing time for supercomputing applications, high-performance applications, whether it's in a server configuration or a desk side configuration. So from workstations to servers, I think we have a real significant play there. So it's hard to guess exactly what it is, but I can't imagine it being too small.  So the way that we think about our growth is partly related to share, partly related to the inherent growth of the PC marketplace, but mostly it's related to new markets. \n Arnab Chanda \u2013 Lehman Brothers : Just one last question. Maybe Marv is getting a little bored there. Do you think that 20% last-three-year growth rate should be able to be a sustainable growth rate longer term, or how do you feel about that? \nMarv Burkett: You want me to give you a long-range forecast. I'm not going to do that. We have some significant growth opportunities. We've executed very well. I hope and believe that we will continue to execute very well. So the real issue then is how quickly do some of these markets develop, and what is our success rate? But beyond that, I won't comment. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - ATR. \n Doug Freedman - ATR : At the analyst day, you spoke about new products in the notebook arena. I know that G80 is really just ramping in production now. But given what we've seen in the marketplace, can you talk about what your timing is for the next-generation GPU out of NVIDIA? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We don't announce products until they are actually on the shelf. But I think the NVIDIA rhythm is sustainable, and it's a rhythm that we're committed to. So the rhythm that you've seen from us over the past several years is something that we are still very committed to. \n Doug Freedman - ATR : Can you talk a little bit more about the front end or back end constraints that you're seeing? You mentioned that there may be some supply constraints in the October quarter. Can you talk a little bit about whether they are front or back end, or give us some clarity on what's happening there? \nMarv Burkett: All of the above. Obviously, certainly in the fab areas, some of the fabs that we use are at capacity now. We would like more wafers, let's put it that way, in some of the fabs that we use. So there is a limitation there. There has been some constraints in both assembly and test as well. I think we can manage our way around most of the constraints in the back end more easily than we can around the constraints in the front end, but there are constraints on both sides. \n Doug Freedman - ATR : I noticed in the July quarter, the tax rate came in at less than we were modeling here. Is there an update for the tax rate going forward? Is there something that happened there? \nMarv Burkett: The tax rate was 14% in Q2, consistent with Q1. We're anticipating a 14% tax rate in Q3. So tax rate is flat, 14%. \n Doug Freedman - ATR : The quarter-to-quarter growth in both professional and consumer? \nMarv Burkett: Consumer was relatively flat quarter to quarter. Professional was down about 10%. Before somebody jumps on that one, we didn't have to push it. Revenue was good. \n Doug Freedman - ATR : Clearly. Congratulations on the excellent execution. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital. \n David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital: Marv, I'm going to take advantage of your vocal chords. Can you talk a little bit about the strength of your Q2 results? Because the AMD unit volumes snapped back very sharply and I thought it would show up in much higher chipset volume. Instead, it showed up in your mainstream desktop volume. Can you explain the difference between the 31% drop off in your first fiscal quarter and a more moderate rebound in the second quarter on the chipset business? \nMarv Burkett: Same answer that we had in the professional workstation business. We didn't have to push it. Revenue was good, and we had to satisfy the GPU customers first. So we didn't have to push it at all. \n David Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital: Second question is, your guidance for Q3 appears to be below normal seasonality. I know there are issues with Taiwan foundries and some back end guys. But if you didn't have the constraint on production, would you be having less than seasonal increase in Q3? \nMarv Burkett: Who knows? If we had plenty of inventory and we had no manufacturing constraints, I don't believe there's any reason we shouldn't grow at industry rates in the quarter. But who knows? We depleted inventories quite dramatically in Q2, so we're left with less of a reserve in inventory than we would like, reserve meaning inventories to be shipped. So that, combined with the manufacturing constraints, just leaves us with some caution. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Aberle \u2013 Caris. \n Nick Aberle \u2013 Caris : Nice quarter. The question had to do with just PC markets. Obviously, Q2 probably better than seasonal , looks like the back half is going to be at least seasonal. How do you guys go about monitoring inventory out at the OEMs and in the channel, just for fear of double ordering or perhaps overheating here exiting 2007? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Over the years, we have developed more rigorous channel monitoring capabilities. We monitor sell-in, we monitor sell-out at each juncture in the channel, and we monitor our customers' inventory the best we can. So based on what we're seeing right now, inventory looks pretty lean in the marketplace. We expect it to remain lean in the marketplace for some time, and so we'll just monitor as we go. \n Nick Aberle \u2013 Caris : With respect to the Intel IGP product, should we be thinking of that as just beginning to ramp in Q3 and then more of a sequential contribution in Q4? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that's a fair estimate. \n Nick Aberle \u2013 Caris : Very last question, just because of the constraints at foundry, are you guys going about qualifying any new foundry partners? \nJen-Hsun Huang: No, we have no plans. We have very close working relationships with our foundries and they are the best foundries in the world, and we do as rigorous of a job planning with them as just about anybody on the planet, and they have come through for us time and time again. My estimation is that they will come through for us again and everything is going to work out just fine. \n Nick Aberle \u2013 Caris : What would the target days of inventory be? Where do you feel comfortable, Marv? \nMarv Burkett: I have always had a target of around 70 days, and I think we have been around 70 days for the most part. We have been a little bit above it in some cases, but to be down at 49 days means we have pretty lean inventory. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research. \n Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Jen-Hsun, you mentioned that the graphics capabilities are becoming more and more appreciated by a wider audience, and I think that is a theme that a lot of us share. Can you talk about what progress you have made there, anecdotally and say in the last six months, what percentage of NVIDIA GPU buyers either embedded or after-market, would be gamers versus non-gamers? Where was that six months, a year ago? Where does it go a year from now? \nJen-Hsun Huang: The question you asked is a good one. It's hard to quantify, but let me give you some directional evidence. If you were to go back five years, the only thing that really took advantage of the GPU was videogames for consumer applications. Today, you have Google Earth, you have photo editing tools that take advantage of GPUs, you have video editing tools that take advantage of GPUs. You have the operating system that takes advantage of the GPU and all of the animation and all the special effects, and all those beautiful things that you see on your display are all rendered by the GPU. You have video processing that's done by the GPU now, because high-definition video is so taxing. To think about running it on the CPU is just not something that you would even dream about.  So there are so many things now that requires a GPU. There's Second Life that requires a GPU. That's a social networking application. So the number of applications out there that reaches different areas is just really, really growing quickly. It's at a time when the GPU is getting harder and harder to build. You notice that the number of second-tier chipset companies in the world who are building DX 10 or even DX 9-level GPUs have really fallen off a cliff. When we say that it costs us $400 million to build a new generation of GPU, we actually mean that. NVIDIA's R&D and most of the company today is in R&D is running close to $1 billion a year run rate now.  So I think it's safe to say that the GPU is very, very hard to build. It's one of the most complex processors ever, anywhere in the computing industry, and that explains its processing capabilities. The number of applications that take advantage of it over time is increasing.  So I hope that anecdotal gives you a bit of a directional, both in number of applications and the fact that chipsets, second-tier chipset companies are finding it very, very hard to keep up with the technology creates ever more opportunities for us. \n Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Yes, agreed. It was a good anecdotal directional. We will have to drill down later on it. But my follow-up question would be on pricing. Can you talk about recent pricing trends, and then given commentary on yours and the industry's supply constraints, is there any pricing leverage you have here in the back half? \nJen-Hsun Huang: The GPU is probably one of the only semiconductor devices in the industries that has kept a relatively flat to slightly up ASPs over the last several years. My sense is that it reflects the importance of the GPU, the increasing number of applications that take advantage of the GPU.  With respect to pricing, we're expecting to work through our tightness of supply. We are not lines down, we are not gapped out, we are not in a bad situation like that. We are just tight, and we know that the entire industry is tight, from PCBs to DRAMs to others. So my sense is that we're going to be just fine. In this environment, it is not our style and it is not our practice to raise prices. We don't do that to our customers, and we're just going to work through it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Tayyib Shah - Longbow Research. \n Tayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Congratulations on the quarter. You talked about how mainstream desktop GPU is driving the market-share gains, which is understandable, given the timing of your product refresh versus your competitors'. Can you talk about the impact you are seeing from AMD's product launch in the OEM channel, especially in the enterprise segment? Is that where you see them concentrating their effort? How does that affect your ability to grow your desktop market share in the near term? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Our mainstream DX 10 GPUs entered the market a solid quarter or two quarters ahead, and the momentum is clearly very strong. The market share data reflects that. We don't win everything in the marketplace, and we still see a lot of competition from our competitors. We have to fight hard for every socket and every design win that we have. So my sense is that we're going to continue to see a lot of competition, and I don't think anything is going to change, despite the environment. So we are prepared for the competition, we will deal with it the best we can and my hope is that we are in a position, because of the superiority of our products and our market position that we will be able to capture even more share, but we will see how it turns out. \n Tayyib Shah - Longbow Research: The follow-up question is for Marv. Can you give us an idea of what you are leaving on the table because of capacity constraints? Can you talk about the chances that eventually you may end up getting all of the supply that you want? Or the fact that what you cannot ship in the third quarter, you still capture that in the early fourth due to the holiday season window? \nMarv Burkett: We are going to work very hard to eliminate any supply constraints in Q3, so we will have to see how it goes, but we think we can work our way through it. We will just have to see. The question of something left on the table in Q3 rolling into Q4, who knows. We will have to see what it is, what the problem is, and what the competition is. There are too many unknowns. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We are not gapped out, it is just tight and we know it is tight because we know our foundries are near capacity, and so we have to be much more focused, we have to be much more precise in our forecasting and planning with our partners, but all of that is happening and so we are optimistic that we are going to serve all of our customers needs and we are just communicating the industry is tight, but we are telling you something you already know. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns. \n Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns : Marv, how much of the margin potential, the margin appreciation you might have expected with the G89 is already in the numbers, and how much more could it impact your margins going forward? \nMarv Burkett: It is a combination of factors. A substantial portion of our current GPU revenue is in the G8x family, but we continue to make progress in reducing costs, even within that family. So there is still a ways to go. We can still do better. Are we more than 50% into the G8x family? Yes. Are we 100%? No. So we have a ways to go, but even if it were 100% we can make further cost reductions. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Just to add some flavor to that, where we have the opportunity to improve gross margins going forward remains in the same well where we found the last, nearly 18% of gross margin improvement; that is operational excellence. We still have plenty of ideas on ways that we can improve the operational efficiency of our company and eliminating waste and improving quality. There are so many things we can still do, and that is where we will focus. I think G7x was a wonderful architecture for us, and G8x is an even better architecture for us, but nonetheless I think that the well for gross margin improvements is right over operational efficiency. \n Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns : Where do you think margins are for your Tesla products as compared to your corporate average, or what you get in your professional solutions business? \nMarv Burkett: Much higher. \n Gurinder Kalra - Bear Stearns : Any way to quantify that? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think in the end it is going to reflect the speed by which we deliver for applications. That still remains to be seen. We are working on that now. It ranges anywhere from a lot to a ton, so we are trying to figure all of that stuff out. It is also a brand new product in a brand new market. This is something that the world has never seen before, so it is hard to precisely set the right price. But we are working with our partners and all of the customers around the world now to make sure we do something that enables rapid adoption and allows us to substantially increase our level of investment for it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. A question for Marv first. What was your pricing change in the GPU business in the quarter sequentially? \nMarv Burkett: Relatively flat. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Just on pricing or generally, we had noticed in the retail channel some price cuts in the very high end and also in some of the lower end segments. Curious if those kind of pricing actions were done by people in the channel or in retail, regardless of what you guys did as far as pricing goes? If you can give us a little bit more color on that, especially given it comes on the heels of six to eight months of pretty stable pricing. \nJen-Hsun Huang: The 8800 demand is really, really solid and it continues to be very good going into the second half of the year. We haven\u2019t done any substantial pricing actions that I know of, but we have a lot of partners in the world and they have their own strategies and we don\u2019t mandate our strategies on them. So maybe what you are seeing is something that is reflected from that. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: Lastly for Marv, given that a lot of the strength in the business is coming from the GPU side, is that in any way affecting the timing of when you think you would reach the 47% gross margin target? \nMarv Burkett: No, I don\u2019t think so. I want to emphasize again, don\u2019t put too much into the fact that the MCC and the workstation group didn\u2019t grow as much as you might have thought. We just didn\u2019t have to push it, and so I still think that in a mix that is inherent in the business that we are going to achieve that gross margin. We will see. \n Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs: So you have some of that flexibility, I guess, to the upside in the workstation business in the next couple of quarters? \nMarv Burkett: I would think so. \nOperator: Sir, we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: NVIDIA delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue, record gross margin and record net income. These results reflect the growing importance of the GPU, as well as great execution across the company. Our ongoing strategy to extend the reach of the GPU is paying off. There is a fast-growing universe of applications that rely on the processing capability of the GPU, from 3D design and styling tools, video and photo editing software, 3D maps and video games, to be using our interfaces with the Mac and Vista.  The GPU can surely enhance the computing experience for everyone, from artists to engineers to scientists to gamers and everyday PC users. As the leading and only dedicated GPU company in the world, our opportunity has never been more exciting as the number of applications and digital devices that benefit from the GPU continues to grow.  Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting on our results for Q3.

With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Fiscal 2009 ended in extraordinary fashion. We reported revenue for the year of $3.4 billion and a GAAP loss of $0.05 per share. The environment is clearly difficult and uncertain so our first priority is to set an operating expense level that balances cash conservation while allowing us to continue to invest in initiatives that are of great importance to the market and in which we lead the industry. We have initiatives in all areas to reduce operating expenses. Our stretch goal is to reduce operating expense by $35 million from the current level of $300 million per quarter by the end of Q2.  Although fiscal 2009 was extremely difficult, it was also one of our best years for innovation. We made important advances in many areas. In graphics processing, after a stumble in Q2 we have regained our performance leadership position with the GeForce GTX 295, GTX 285 and GTX 260. We introduced PhysX, the industry\u2019s first GPU accelerated physics processing. Major studios including Electronic Arts, THQ and Take 2 have standardized on PhysX. DriverHeaven noted that \u201cthere are real visual benefits to be had from enabling PhysX in games such as Mirror\u2019s Edge.\u201d Bit-tech said that \u201cthe PhysX content enhances the gaming experience, giving a tangible benefit to being a video card owner.\u201d  Gamers have been stunned by our 3-D vision, full HD stereoscopic solution. Three-D vision is the first ever high resolution, stereo 3-D solution for the home. Bjorn3d said that \u201conce you have it, you will never give it up.\u201d PC Magazine described it as \u201ca mind blowing innovation.\u201d In Q4 we recaptured market share in the performance segment. We intend to continue share gains by offering the highest performance products while differentiating with our advantages in PhysX, CUDA and 3-D Vision. We shipped Tesla for revenues this year and officially started the era of GPU computing, where our CUDA parallel processing architecture can accelerate computive intensive applications by 100 times over a CPU alone. CUDA has well over 25,000 developers around the world. With CUDA we\u2019re able to speed up general purpose computer intensive applications like we do for 3-D graphics processing. Developers are finding major speed ups for algorithms ranging from nano-molecular dynamics to image processing; medical image reconstruction; and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis. Over 100 universities around the world including the MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the National Taiwan University now teach parallel computing with CUDA. ASoos, Bull, Cray, Dell, HP and Lenovo now offer high performance computing solutions with Tesla. There are now over 1,000 customers around the world including Motorola, Chevron, GE Healthcare and even General Mills the consumer products company. Tesla has become the first GPU used in super computing and now powers Japan\u2019s Tsubame, the 29th fastest supercomputer in the world. And Wipro Technologies responding to market demand now offers CUDA programming services.  Aside from the thousands of researchers who have used CUDA to accelerate their time to discovery, popular off the shelf software packages such as ANSYS, LANView and Mathematica are now CUDA accelerated. Symcor sells check scanners that use CUDA for image recognition to detect fraud. Scicomp uses CUDA in their derivatives pricing software. And medical equipment is now available from Technic Scan that uses CUDA to enhance early detection of breast cancer, reducing the analysis from a three hour process to just 16 minutes, making single visit diagnosis possible for the first time. We launched the Tesla personal supercomputer and enabled a four Teraflop supercomputer at the price of a typical workstation. We estimate 15 million scientists and engineers worldwide can benefit from this breakthrough. HPC, High Performance Computing wire described it as \u201cthe biggest news of the supercomputing \u201908 show.\u201d Cray with the CX-1 was the first to ship a Tesla personal supercomputer. One of our major initiatives last year was to capture a significant position in mobile computing by introducing innovative and market defining products. Notebook is the fastest growing segment of the PC market and one that we can offer a great deal of value. Through low power architecture and innovation, our GPU\u2019s can simultaneously increase notebook performance while extending battery life.  We announced Ion, a high performance GPU that also incorporates all system networking and IO functions into a single chip. Steve Jobst called it \u201can incredible chip.\u201d Ion is at the core of every MAC book from the air to the pro. The Ion platform is now shipping or will be soon from virtually every major PC OEM. At CS we launched Ion for Intel\u2019s Atom CPU. Even coupled with the smallest X86 CPU in the world, the performance is astounding. TechGage described the Ion PC as \u201ca potent little computer with almost limitless possibilities\u201d and gave it a Best of CES Award. It was also awarded the Best Enabling Technology by Laptop Magazine. And Computer Reseller News described it as \u201cone of the top ten biggest chip stories of 2008.\u201d We also made great progress with Tegra, our ultra low power mobile computing processor. Tegra is a single chip mobile computer that delivers a full Internet experience while consuming 1/20th the power of even the lowest power [X-80] PC\u2019s. Tegra enables a new class of mobile Internet computing devices that allow for many days of use as opposed to the several hours of battery life for a notebook PC. Tegra has been designed into personal media players; personal navigation devices; smart phones and mobile Internet computers and we\u2019ll see revenue ramping in the second half of this year. We had three major strategic objectives this year; lead the industry in graphics processing, revolutionize computing with CUDA and Tesla, and establish NVIDIA as a low power innovator by creating breakthrough products for mobile computing. I am pleased with the excellent achievements we made in each of these important areas.  Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results. I will return in a moment to talk of our future opportunities.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Thanks Jen-Hsun. My comments today will cover both the full year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 that ended January 25, 2009, including comments on both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included in our press release and on our website. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $481.1 million which is down 46% from Q3 and is down 60% year-over-year. Revenue for the full year was $3.4 billion which is down from the prior year by 16%. The weakness in demand for the fourth quarter was across the board. Compared to Q3 the GPU business was down 47%; the Professional Services business was down 44%; and the NCP business was down 51%. There were no safe havens. Within the GPU business desktop was down 34% as we believe we regained some market share particularly in the high end, but the overall high end market was very soft. Notebook was down 63%, reflecting the buying trend toward low end systems with integrated graphics. Memory was down to $7.2 million for the quarter from $22.3 million the prior quarter. All of this was in the environment of the channel depleting inventory.  Therefore, our sell-in was less than the channels sell-out. We believe current channel inventory is only slightly more than one month, down from almost three months last quarter. ASP\u2019s across the board were relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, so the decline in revenue was primarily a reflection of the decline in unit volume.  Gross margin for the quarter was 29.4% on a GAAP basis. Included in the GAAP results were several items worth mentioning. For the quarter, we took new inventory reserves of slightly more than $50 million. Normally we take reserves of $5 to $10 million. These additional reserves reflect the reduced demand in the marketplace. These additional reserves cost us almost ten percentage points in gross margin for the quarter. Without these reserves, gross margin still would have declined quarter-to-quarter but more in line with the market movement toward the low end SKUs. Also included in the GAAP results is a small initial insurance reimbursement for the weak, Die/Packaging material set warranty issue that we recognized in Q2. Since our estimate for the cost of this warranty issue is unchanged, most of the insurance proceeds were recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold for GAAP purposes. Stock-based compensation allocated to cost of goods sold was approximately $2 million for the quarter.  Operating expenses included a non-recurring charge of $18.9 million associated with the termination of a development contract related to a new campus construction project that we have put on hold. Without this charge, operating expenses would have been below our guidance. As Jen-Hsun said we have initiated many cost reduction efforts and even in Q4 some of them began to take effect. Without stock-based compensation and the non-recurring charge, operating expenses were down from the third quarter.  Headcount for the quarter and the year ended at 5,420 which is up 127 from the third quarter and up 435 for the year. We essentially have a hiring freeze in place with only the most critical positions being filled. The tax rate for the quarter was a credit of 13.3% and for the year it was a credit of 30%. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $147.7 million and non-GAAP was a loss of $94.4 million. GAAP net loss for the year was $30 million and for non-GAAP it was a net income of $303 million.  On the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $1.26 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This is down approximately $49 million from the prior quarter. Operating activities in the quarter used only about $20 million in cash which reflects good asset management in light of the significant decline in revenue. Accounts receivable declined by $289 million quarter-to-quarter reflecting the comparable revenue decline. The days sales outstanding declined slightly quarter-to-quarter and so far receivables appear to be in good shape. Inventories grew by $14 million quarter-to-quarter even after the additional inventory reserves. Obviously the significant decline in revenue left us with a lot of inventory. We believe the inventory is good. There\u2019s just a lot of it. As a result we have significantly reduced our manufacturing demands. We expect to deplete significant amounts of inventory going forward. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $50 million, flat with Q3. And capital expenditures were $43 million, down from $109 million last quarter. We have a focus on reducing capital expenditures and want them to be less than depreciation and amortization on a quarterly basis. Accounts payable declined by $168 million as we scaled back production levels.  As for an outlook, in this environment it\u2019s almost impossible to give a reasonable and competent forecast. We were very wrong last quarter. In retrospect, October was the last decent month and unfortunately it was not in our quarter. But based on the fact that sell-out for the channel exceeded our sell-in and the very low inventory levels in the channel, we do not see further declines in revenue. Today we can\u2019t say confidently when and by how much revenue will increase. We can only say that we currently don\u2019t see further declines and our outlook is for flat to slightly up revenue for the first quarter. As for gross margins, we currently do not expect significant inventory write-offs in Q1 and margins should return to the mid-30\u2019s. The one thing we can control is our operating expenses and as Jen-Hsun said we\u2019re instituting many actions to contain and reduce OpEx. Normally in Q1 operating expenses would be up $15 million or more from Q4, merely because of the FICA we have to pay in the beginning of the year and the reduced amount of time off that employees take in Q1 relative to Q4. Because of the actions we have already taken and further actions that we are implementing, we believe OpEx for the first quarter will be flat to slightly down from the Q4 level. And that these actions will lead to further reductions in Q2 and Q3. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thanks Marv. The GPU is the new soul of the PC. In high performance computing our GPU\u2019s are accelerating time to discovery, in many cases 100 times. It would take [Morris Long] nearly ten years to improve the performance of a computer 100 times. This speed up is truly revolutionary.  For gamers our GPU not only renders a beautiful and immersive world but with PhysX we also simulate the physical properties of the world to bring more dynamics and realism. We are delighting visual content creators around the world as our CUDA GPU\u2019s make it possible for them to manipulate high resolution images with great ease and reduce video editing process from hours to minutes. And for mobile computers, our GPU brings a level of performance that is surprising while enhancing battery life at the same time. Whether for gamers or digital artists or researchers, and from workstations to supercomputers to game PC\u2019s to notebook PC\u2019s, the GPU is making the critical difference. The GPU is the new soul of the PC. The word is spreading fast. Wired Magazine recently wrote, \u201cLike a wise-cracking sidekick who winds up stealing the movie from a too bland lead actor, Graphics Processing Units are edging more general purpose, central processing units out of the limelight.\u201d USA Today wrote, \u201c[Separate] graphics chips sometimes called discrete graphics can vastly improve a PC\u2019s performance by crunching images separately instead of relying on the main processor to do it.\u201d And CNET News said, \u201cWhen you start looking at a PC today the central processor means less and less. The GPU is simply becoming a better way for PC makers to differentiate.\u201d As the inventor of the GPU, our objective this year is to continue to expand the use and proliferate the adoption of GPU\u2019s. From notebook PC\u2019s to net books to supercomputing workstations to servers, we have great opportunities ahead to grow our business. We are in a position to take share with GeForce as we continue to highlight our advantages with CUDA, PhysX and 3D Vision. Tesla is now shipping and interest around the world continues to build. We will ship Tegra this year.  Both Tesla and Tegra take us into new growth markets and will increase our [tamp]. And with Ion we are going to revolutionize the small and affordable notebook PC market, giving us growth into the fastest growing PC segment. During the year we also have operational challenges we must address. To get gross margins improving again, we must tackle our inventory management. This is one of our top priorities and we will surely address it. We will also be highly discriminating on spending, so as to conserve cash flow allowing us to continue to invest and realizing our vision for the era of the GPU. These are surely challenging times but we are also more excited than ever about the prospects of the GPU and the importance of our work. We are delighted to take questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities:  First off can you help us understand what makes you feel confident about the \u2013 about your revenue guidance and that you\u2019re not looking for a sequential decline in the upcoming quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Well, I guess I\u2019ll comment and I\u2019ll let Marv comment. You know we track sell-outs rigorously in the marketplace and you\u2019ve now heard this from nearly every computer company in the world or in just about every electronics company in the world that for whatever reason October was a reasonable month, but November fell off a cliff. November was the beginning of our quarter and so we experienced three consecutive difficult months. As we monitored our sell-outs we saw that very effect, that the end markets just got weaker starting in November. And since then it has more or less flattened out if not slightly increased a bit. And because we know what we\u2019re selling into our customers and because we know what they\u2019re selling out, we have a pretty good sense that inventory levels are depleting very quickly. And so that\u2019s how we get a sense of where we are in the business and we believe we\u2019ve hit a trough. But the important thing is that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. And there\u2019s a lot of people in the world who don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know right now. And I don\u2019t think we stand alone here. But that\u2019s our best estimate of our business and therefore best guidance that we can offer you.\nMarvin D. Burkett :  Yes, I would emphasize exactly what Jen-Hsun said. The sell-out while it is weak was definitely not as weak as our revenue in the quarter. So the depletion of inventory in the channel, coupled with the fact that we did not have a decent \u2013 October was not in our quarter, says that unless demand continues to fall significantly from here that our prospects are better than they were last quarter.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan Securities:  And then as a follow-up, just given the fact that we were hearing chatter about new SKU\u2019s coming from you guys and your competitors or your friends over there in Santa Clara there \u2013 in Sunnyvale, any sense of a pricing war? Anything in terms of competitive pricing or advantages here?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I don\u2019t think either company is holding any punches at the moment and so I\u2019m not expecting the competitive position to be more competitive than now. There are plenty of opportunities for us to be competitive with each other. It\u2019s a very competitive market. And there are always new SKU\u2019s coming out. You know they have new products and we have new products. We\u2019re not in the business of announcing future products. We have quite a strong position right now in the performance segment again. And so we have no reason to announce future products.  The competition is obviously different so they\u2019re talking about future prospects all the time right now. It just serves to freeze their market. And so I think that announcing the next generation product long before it gets shipped is not a smart thing to do right now.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Daniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research.\nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research:  On the downturn here, how much of the current revenue weakness is the overall market decline versus a down specing of machines in the market, where they\u2019re either going to a lower spec GPU or you know settling with the integrated one? So demand for PC\u2019s overall going down and the other is what they\u2019re specing on that machine. And then related to that as we look across this economic downturn which none of us know how long it is, but the longer it is do we run a greater risk of the and we should for the mainstream part of the market the integrated graphics chip improving to the point where it\u2019s good enough. So if the downturn is one or two years but in one or two years time the integrated sort of catches up to be good enough for the mainstream part of the market.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Our ASP\u2019s were generally flat this quarter. And so from that you could argue that people are not buying down per se. There is a very significant factor that is happening in the notebook segment however. There\u2019s the surge of the net book market and you could characterize the net book market as low end. And if I were to just for the sake of my description right now describe the market as high, mid and low our participation in the notebook market has been by and large about the upper half of mid and most of high. And we have no participation historically in the lower part of mid and the low end market. All of a sudden the Atom processor has driven a dramatic surge of net book PC\u2019s. Some people call it a net book PC but the fact of the matter is they\u2019re inexpensive PC\u2019s. And during difficult times many people who still need to have a PC or would like to have a PC now has a very inexpensive version to buy. And so the demand for Atom PC\u2019s and these net books if you will has really really surged. I think what\u2019s going to happen is that the low end part of the marketplace is going to cannibalize the mid-range part of the market. And people who want performance still will go for performance. The net book will hardly serve their needs. But for a lot of people in the mid-range part of the marketplace the net book is clearly, clearly going to disrupt that. And so our strategy is Ion. We announced Ion for the Atom processor at ZS. And the reception has been extraordinary. And the reason for that is because Atom with the Ion processor creates a full feature notebook. It\u2019s fully capable of DX 10, 3D graphics, high definition video, Blu-ray Disc, just about anything you want to do on your computer is possible with the Atom processor and an Ion.  And so this platform I think is a wonderful growth opportunity for us because it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve really been able to enter into the lower end segment of the marketplace. But I think you\u2019re \u2013 what you\u2019re thinking about the future of the PC industry certainly is true. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s likely to happen, that the high end marketplace will continue to be what it is as people who want more performance can get it. There\u2019s a lot of different reasons to bring performance to the high end. But the mid-range part of the marketplace could very well become an extremely large low-end part of the marketplace.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Joanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.:  I just was hoping to get a little bit of clarity about how you guys were thinking about the current environment, what you\u2019re assuming when you draw that conclusion about hopefully flat or slightly up. So would we have to think that you\u2019re assuming that end market demand is going to be flat to slightly up or that the channel might be rebuilding inventory this quarter and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to pull up your revenues?\nMarvin D. Burkett :  No, Joanne, if you just assume that the market didn\u2019t get any better our revenue has to go up because remember they depleted significant channel inventory last quarter. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.:  Can you give us a sense of how much that went down in your estimation, Marv?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  You\u2019re talking about the inventory?\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.:  Yes.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  I think that they went from two-and-a-half to three months worth of inventory down to between one and one-and-a-half months of inventory.\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest Securities Corp.:  And then within your inventory in house, can you give us a sense of how much of that inventory \u2013 what share is the older 65 nanometer product and what\u2019s the newer stuff?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, we have more 65 nanometer parts than I thought we were going to have. But that\u2019s because the revenue was less than we thought. But I would still say the majority of the product by far is 55 nanometer. So we\u2019re going through the 65. It\u2019s more than I would like to have but it\u2019s not an intolerable amount.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Tim Luke - Barclays Capital.\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital:  A couple of quick things, Marv, just starting off on inventory your inventory\u2019s now like at 140 days on hand. Where do you think that goes directionally in the April quarter and what are you trying to target? I would assume where you\u2019ve had success with moving the channel lower the inventory\u2019s showing somewhat higher in terms of just the revenue balance. Separately I was just wondering if you could just lay out for us some of the factors that you think may help the gross margin. I think you\u2019re saying 35 or mid-30\u2019s going forward for April. How do you see that going forward? And then lastly, if I may, in planning your OpEx which you\u2019re lowering by $35 million, how are you thinking about the revenue? Obviously you\u2019re not at breakeven yet. How are you thinking about the revenue shape for the back half of the year? And maybe that\u2019s more of a Jen-Hsun question. Or are you just suggesting that you\u2019ve got to invest irrespective of when you see the revenue come back. And where is that revenue? Is it mostly in the new products or how do you see desktop for example? Thank you.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, let me take the inventory issue first. We have significantly cut back our [wafer] starts. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a surprise to anyone. When you have this inventory level we don\u2019t need a lot more wafers. So based on the inventory that we have, if you look into Q1 I see a significant inventory reduction coming. I can\u2019t give you the magnitude of that until you give me the revenue number. But I would say something significantly reduced in Q1. Going forward this inventory should last us into the Q2 and Q3 before we have to replenish at those levels. So I think that our production buys are going to remain at a low level all the way through Q1 and it\u2019s going to take something into Q2 and Q3 with some other products and a slightly better market before we have to reinstitute wafer buys. The last question that you have with regard to the OpEx is that I go back to the goal that Jen-Hsun has established, of getting revenue down by $35 million on a quarterly basis as what we can do without jeopardizing future revenue. It is not based on us being able to breakeven at some revenue level. It\u2019s on the basis of what we think we can do without jeopardizing the future. Now at $500 million even if you cut it by $35 million we would not breakeven. So the issue is when does revenue start to recover and how successful are we in bringing the OpEx down by the $35 million.\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital:  And also presumably where do you think the gross is? Presumably you\u2019re not spending a lot in the desktop GPU space or are you in terms of investment and OpEx? Is the spending mostly on the new products?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Well, in the second half of the year we have some areas of growth that we\u2019re relatively confident about. And these are areas of new growth. Tegra, our mobile computing device \u2013 mobile computing processor will ship towards the second half of the year. And so we\u2019re confident that will be revenue contributing and profit contributing.  Tesla continues to ramp. We are engaged with more customers all the time who are looking for Tesla in their servers to dramatically accelerate their computing needs. So we\u2019re expecting that to grow. We\u2019re also expecting Ion to contribute greatly to our growth going forward. Ion is as we talked about both a really fabulous net \u2013 a notebook processor but also is terrific in the entry level part of the PC marketplace in companion with a very low cost microprocessor.  And so we think that that could revolutionize the affordable PC market and so my sense is that we\u2019re going to continue to see growth in the Ion business. So those are \u2013 I\u2019m sorry?\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital:  I was just wondering if Marv if separately you might be able to address the gross margin as [inaudible]?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Yes, if you look at the gross margin from last quarter you would have what I would call a more normal inventory reserve position. That would have added eight to ten percentage points to margin. So all you have to do is not write off a lot of inventory and the margins return to the level that I outlined.\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital: For the nanometer could you confirm the timeline that you\u2019re expecting for that transition? Thank you so much.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We have really fabulous products in the marketplace today and we don\u2019t announce future products.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech.\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech:  Marv can you go through the new product segment and give us an idea which ones are likely to be accretive to gross margins and which ones should you be more successful are actually going to be a headwind? And any comment that you guys can make about the gaming PC platforms would be helpful as well.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Accretive gross margins \u2013 which gross margin level are you talking about it being accretive to? The one for last quarter doesn\u2019t take much.\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech:  Good point.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, let\u2019s take them somewhat in order. Tesla certainly is accretive gross margin. You know I think Tegra is certainly not a drag. I think it depends on what gross margin level that you\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s not a drag. If you\u2019re talking about the Ion platform, it\u2019s probably in the mid-30\u2019s. So if we\u2019re very successful there it\u2019s not a huge improvement in the gross margin percentage but certainly a significant improvement in gross margin dollars. Does that help?\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech:  And then can you talk about the gaming platforms and what\u2019s happening in the gaming market space?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  What is the gaming platforms?\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech: PS Sony, PS 3 and Royal [inaudible].\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I don\u2019t know what the question is. I mean they \u2013\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Do you want to know what the revenue was in the quarter or?\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech:  Yes. Yes, the revenue or what your outlook is for that marketplace if that\u2019s seeing the same type of conditions that you\u2019ve seen in your market space.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes. I think it \u2013 remember a significant portion of the I\u2019ll call it the Sony Royalty portion is based on their unit production. And so as their unit productions drop, our revenue in that segment will drop. And I think that they\u2019re projecting much lower production levels in Q1 than they had in Q4.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Suji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.\nSuji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.:  On Ion can you guys talk about what you think the pace and quantity of the ramp here, just in terms of your share on the Intel platform particularly?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I don\u2019t know how to characterize it for you really aside from the fact that we have no booked projects happening all over the world. You know a lot of it just depends on the success of our customers and these platforms. So there\u2019s still a lot of execution between now and then and lots of unknowns. So I\u2019m reluctant to give you numbers that frankly I don\u2019t know how to project.  I do know that the design activity around our chip set is increasing and I do know that we\u2019ve announced a really exciting product. So I think if and the markets are really resonating with it then I\u2019m sure that if you follow this market you\u2019ve heard just about nothing but about Ion these days and the excitement that people have to build net books and low-end notebooks with it. So I\u2019m enthusiastic about the prospects and I look forward to reporting on in a couple of quarters.\nSuji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.:  But Jen-Hsun then the timing would be back half loaded or steady throughout the year? Any comments there? \nJen-Hsun Huang:  There are design wins that are being launched in just about every quarter. There\u2019s some this quarter. There will be some the next quarter for sure. And hopefully they\u2019ll be all fully ramped up for Q3, Q4.\nSuji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.:  And switching to your guidance in terms of the flat revenues, how do you see that and the notebook market versus the desktop market given the different dynamics you cited for the current quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  We don\u2019t see significant change in any of them. You know if they are relatively flat to slightly up there\u2019s not a significant change in any of them. We don\u2019t think that the flat is derived from any one particular segment.\nSuji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.:  And then on the OpEx cuts were there any particular areas that were kind of overly hit by those or was it a broad-based effort on the part of the company to do more maybe with six people instead of seven people. Is that the spirit of it Jen-Hsun?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We affected a lot of different areas whether it\u2019s the executives of our company took the largest and most significant affects. But many of our \u2013 almost all of our employees will make a contribution. There\u2019s travel reductions; there\u2019s just ideas all around the world and around the company to reduce spending wherever it can be reduced without affecting the key investments that I\u2019ve highlighted. So it\u2019s broad-based and it\u2019s everywhere.\nSuji De Silva - Kaufman Bros.:  What\u2019s the pricing decline you\u2019re assuming in your guidance versus what typical pricing would decline? Thanks.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  No change.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital:  Can you talk a little about the Marv on the breakeven either on a pro forma basis or on a cash basis? What kind of revenues are we looking at from a breakeven standpoint on a quarterly basis?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, that\u2019s a very complex question David. You have to tell me where the revenue is, what the gross margins are, how successful we are in getting our OpEx down to that targeted level.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital:  If we achieve the targeted level OpEx and if we have gross margin in the mid to sort of mid-30\u2019s, what kind of cash breakeven \u2013 operating cash breakeven are we looking at or pro forma breakeven are we looking at?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, that\u2019s an easy calculation for you to do. I\u2019m not going to do it. If you have operating expenses at the $265 level, that includes some stock-based compensation which is non-cash; that includes some depreciation which is non-cash and so now you have a gross margin number on X dollars of revenue that\u2019s an easy calculation to make.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital:  What about if I were to look at say the revenue is $500 million is your first quarter roughly end demand number and the peak of last year was about \u2013 assuming that those are all end demand about $900 million whereabouts if you make the seasonal adjustment, where is end demand? If Q1 is $500 assuming normal seasonality, how high would that number be on your best quarter of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  You know, David, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m saying something that\u2019s inconsistent with what you know, there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re experiencing right now that is seasonal. We don\u2019t mean to make light of it but the environment is very difficult and uncertain. It\u2019s very difficult and uncertain not just for us but it\u2019s very difficult and uncertain for everybody. And so our strategy is to make sure that we eliminate and as be as discriminating as we can on spending, but continue to invest in the things that we know are important to the marketplace and things that we\u2019re world class at doing, and continue to innovate and challenge our employees to build amazing things.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital:  Talking about innovation there has been a number \u2013 I guess the next round of game console design wins are coming up or rumor has been awarded to different people. How close are we actually in terms of competing for the next generation of PS4 or Xbox or Wii?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  It makes no sense to comment on rumors. And it also would be terrible to comment on future products of our customers. It is not our job to do that. And so it\u2019s just \u2013 they\u2019re just rumors, David.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Shawn Webster - J.P. Morgan.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  Would you characterize the one to one-and-a-half months of inventory as being normal or lean or still on the high end of normal?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Very lean.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  So is your visibility now about the same or better than it was when you came into the January quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  How do you mean that, the January quarter? You mean our Q1?\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  Would you say that you\u2019re setting the guidance at flattish or up slightly now, would you say that your visibility now was better than where it was when you came into Q4 or the same?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  I don\u2019t know how you characterize that because when we went into Q4 the market had not dropped off a cliff. So I should certainly hope that the visibility is better now than it was then.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan:  Can you give us an update on some of your new products and what did Tesla represent for revenues for you in Q4 and Tegra and your outlook for calendar 2009?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Let\u2019s see, Tesla for Q4 did we break that out?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  We haven\u2019t broken it out in the past. It was up millions of dollars, several million dollars. I won\u2019t characterize it beyond that. When it gets to be significant Shawn we\u2019ll break it out. Tegra was insignificant.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Tegra hasn\u2019t shipped yet. It\u2019s really second half of the year.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Uche Orji \u2013 UBS.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS:  First question to you Marv, if I look at the guidance you\u2019re giving for the current quarter, how much \u2013 what should we expect for the workstation business within that guidance? And if you can just explain that in the context of what is a very challenging IT spending environment. I just want to be able to reconcile how much that will contribute across margin and just reconcile it with your guidance. So if you can talk about what that makes you see in the workstation business \u2013 what you saw the last quarter and what you are implying within the guidance of the current quarter that would be helpful.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Okay. Now the workstation business took a precipitous decline in last quarter Q4. It was down about 47%, Q3 to Q4. That was surprising. I mean if it was any business that would be somewhat of a safe haven from this you would have thought it was in the workstation area. Didn\u2019t happen. So what the anticipation is relatively no change from the Q4 levels into Q1. So a continued weakness I would call it.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS:  And that is supported by what you have in the backlog currently or do you require turns business to make that flat revenue guidance? This is very important for your gross margin. That\u2019s the reason why I\u2019m pressing on this.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, we always require turns. We are not a business or our business model is not based on a significant backlog at the beginning of the quarter. Our whole business is based on significant turns within the quarter.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS:  If I look at the high-end GPU business, what is happening with pricing right now? Is pricing stabilized at this point because you know late last year [A&D] did try to make a push in that market. And so what is the outlook for pricing in that market for the current quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  In Q2 of last year we did take a big step down in pricing. We improperly priced our products too high. But we corrected that almost right away. The pricing that we\u2019re seeing out there is relatively stable at the moment. We\u2019re gaining share and we have the best products and we stay focused and continue to do our work and highlight our unique advantages with CUDA and PhysX and 3D Vision. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll continue to gain share.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS:  With Intel introducing some chipset product that allows them to [M&P] you know I\u2019m just trying to understand how you now position Ion because you know 3D gaming which is probably a key feature is not something that you\u2019ve heard [inaudible] talk about as something consumers care about in a big way. So how are you going to position Ion against that [one view]?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  You know 720P is not Blu-ray compatible as you know. And 720P is the minimum requirement of high def and so high definition includes all the way to 1080P for one. The overall performance under Windows Vista and Vista Premium and the requirements for DX10 and Windows 7 coming out and you know all of the trans-coding and video editing and video processing capabilities of CUDA are available on the Ion platform. And so if you want the best possible experience while still being extremely affordable Ion is really the way to go.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from James Schneider - Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs:  To follow up on the gross margin question a little bit, in the GPU space specifically desktop and notebooks can you talk about some of the pressure you might see from pricing and inventory reductions in the out quarters going into the second half versus whatever benefits you might get from 55 nanometer and lower cost reductions?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Wow. You know that\u2019s difficult to say. I mean all of our production now is on 55 nanometer and you know later in the year would be even smaller geometries but how that impacts the gross margin is difficult to say. I think that the individual product gross margin in my view is not the issue. It\u2019s the total volume. So I think we\u2019ll do fine from a gross margin standpoint. \nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs:  So would you expect the GPU margins to continue to recover into the back half after or early into Q2?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well I think the gross margins to the GPU business will recover in Q1. Remember a significant portion of the I\u2019ll call it the increased inventory write-off we took in Q4 was in the GPU business. So there should be significant recovery in GPU gross margins in Q1.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs:  But no sense about beyond Q1?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  No.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs:  And then just a follow-up I think Jen-Hsun you mentioned Ion in reference to the chipset product on notebook platforms as well as it\u2019s paired with the Intel Atom processor. Could you talk about some of the design wins you\u2019ve got specifically when paired with the Intel Atom please?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Well we shouldn\u2019t announce any design wins until the design wins ship. And so when it does ship I\u2019d be more than delighted to address it. I can only tell you that there\u2019s enthusiastic support and design activities all over the world and so we\u2019ll see when they ship. When they do ship hopefully it\u2019s not too long we\u2019ll be delighted to talk about it.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Glen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  Marv I hear your point that you don\u2019t want to impair your future growth by reducing OpEx to too low a level but one could argue that with sales down 60% year-on-year and you know with a pretty uncertain end market out there the future growth isn\u2019t hurt anyway. So I guess when we think about your business going forward what would you need to see? I mean is there some lack of growth element out there that says, \u201cJeez, I\u2019ve got to cut anyway because it\u2019s just so bad.\u201d\nMarvin D. Burkett:  Well, we\u2019re always looking at things like that. That\u2019s the job of management to look at them. You know if you were to tell me that the current economic environment is going to continue for the next ten years, then lots of people not only us but other companies are going to have to restructure their businesses. If you\u2019re telling me that the economic environment will change very quickly that\u2019s an early holding on till it comes back. So I don\u2019t know how long this economic environment is going to take. But I do know the only way out of recessions and significant recessions like this is not by cutting your future. The way out of the recession is by investing in future revenues. So we want to continue to do that. As long as we\u2019re not burning through significant cash, and as long as we\u2019re investing in the right places, that\u2019s more significant to me. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the economic environment. \nJen-Hsun Huang:  And the investments that we make, Glen, we want to make sure that we\u2019ve scrutinized all of our investments. And we\u2019ve asked ourselves are we investing in areas that\u2019s going to lead us to growth? And if it\u2019s not going to lead us to growth there\u2019s no point investing in it. And so we have to believe in what we believe. And once we believe it we\u2019re going to stay committed to it. Obviously environments change and we\u2019ll continue to reevaluate but based on what we see right now we\u2019re making good decisions.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  I also wanted to ask about the linearity in the reported quarter and the implication that has for the start of the quarter because it sounds like November was really bad, I would guess that December was probably worse. Was January better? And at the beginning of February because of the flat guidance I\u2019m just thinking about the pattern in the last quarter, it would sort of suggest February must have started off not that bad. And maybe if you could confirm or deny if that\u2019s true.\nMarvin D. Burkett:  November started off bad. December was worse and January wasn\u2019t a lot better.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  Marv if I think about that going down from the first month to the third month, if you want to be flat don\u2019t you have to be going up in the first month to the third month in this quarter? And doesn\u2019t that seem like an unlikely situation?\nMarvin D. Burkett:  No, I don\u2019t think so. You know, I think that you saw us being I\u2019ll call it a victim of the quarter, our quarter being November, December, January. I think that was a negative compared to some of the other guys out there that are on a calendar quarter. I think that the depletion of the channel inventory was a negative for us relative to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. And those two factors alone tell me that they weren\u2019t normal if you want to call it that or the run rate of consumption out there is equal to or better than our revenue for the last quarter.\nOperator:  I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead sir.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thank you for joining us today.

In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response, we will allow one follow-up question. With that, I will hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thanks Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We reported revenue of $898 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.11, in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.20. During the quarter, we accomplished several important objectives that position us to return to growth. We improved our financial performance by increasing our non-GAAP gross margins from 39.1% to 41.9%, while managing our operating expenses tightly. We transitioned our performance segment GPUs to 55nm and now have the fastest products at each price point, positioning us to recapture share. Together with Apple, NVIDIA launched a new GeForce 9400M motherboard GPU for its new lineup of Mac notebooks. The GeForce 9400M is the industry's first processor to integrate three complex chips \u2013 the Northbridge, the IO/network processor, and a GeForce GPU into a single chip, and it delivers up to 5 times performance improvement over Intel integrated graphics in one-half the space. The MacBook and MacBook Air come standard with the 9400M. The MacBook Pro comes standard with a hybrid combination of two GeForce GPUs \u2013 where the 9400M is used for maximum battery life and a GeForce 9600M GT for high performance mode. We announced the NVIDIA Quadro CX, the industry's first accelerator for Adobe's Creative Suite 4 content creation software. NVIDIA specifically designed and optimized the Quadro CX to enhance the performance of the CS4 product line and give creative professionals the ultimate in performance and productivity. CUDA continues to gain momentum all over the world. There are now well over 750 research papers published on how GPU computing with CUDA can dramatically accelerate computing-intensive algorithms, such as N-body simulations for molecular dynamics and astrophysics, linear algebra, CT image reconstruction; image and video processing, such as image recognition and search, string processing for gene sequencing, and string search and so on. CUDA has received PC Magazine\u2019s Technical Excellence Award. There are now over 50 universities around the world teaching CUDA in their computer science curriculum. And we\u2019ve now shipped over 100 million GPUs with CUDA. At this year's SIGGRAPH, NVIDIA set a new milestone in computer graphics by demonstrating the world's first real-time fully-interactive ray tracer. Our interactive ray tracing solution adds a new capability to our Quadro visual computing solutions, and will enable customers, like the auto industry, to preview car designs and demonstrate new cars to customers. Visual computing took center stage during the Presidential election television coverage. Every dynamic graphic was rendered live on NVIDIA Quadro. The underlying applications from our close ISP partners, Vizrt, Brainstorm, and RealityCheck used NVIDIA technologies, including CgFX or Shader FX, and NVIDIA Scene Graph to deliver what broadcast experts are calling one of the most successful election broadcasts in history. Perceptive Pixel\u2019s interactive touch displays were even the highlight of a skit on Saturday Night Live. CNN pushed the boundary even further with holographic projections of its newscasters from remote locations. Leveraging camera, tracking technology used in sports and film, they composited NVIDIA real-time rendered virtual sets with live video to enable effects never seen before. All of these effects and experiences were made possible by Quadro. Visual computing is revolutionizing many aspects of our lives, from broadcasting to the PC to mobile devices and to the internet. NVIDIA is in the center of this revolution. I will return later to highlight a number of our key initiatives later in the call. Let me now turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results.\nMarv Burkett:  Thanks, Jen-Hsun. My comments today will cover the third fiscal quarter of fiscal year \u201909 that ended October 26, including comments on both GAAP and non-GAAP results. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included in our press release and on our website. As Jen-Hsun stated earlier, revenue for the quarter was $898 million, up $5 million or less than 1% from the second quarter. With all the turbulence in the financial markets in Q3, we might have expected our business to be even more impacted. That is not to say that our business wasn\u2019t impacted, it\u2019s myriad to say that our markets showed some resiliency in the face of disruptions in the financial markets. Revenue in our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory was down 8% quarter to quarter, or $42 million. Desktop was down 12% and notebook was down 4%. Within desktop, the softness was unit-related as ASPs actually increased slightly from the second quarter. As we transitioned our performance segment GPUs to 55nm, we re-established performance leadership, which helped ASPs. Within notebook, it was the reverse, as units increased but there was a slight decrease in ASPs. ASPs for the Montevina refresh are lower in general, but gross margin is still good. GPU gross margin improved in the quarter from the low levels in Q2. MCP showed strong growth of nearly 19% quarter to quarter, or $31 million, as we\u2019ve ramped volume production of MCP79, which is the GeForce 9300 and 9400 series. Total MCP79 revenue was more than $75 million in the quarter. Professional solutions, including our workstation business, grew by 11%, or $20 million, quarter to quarter. The consumer business was relatively flat quarter to quarter and had growth in the Sony royalties offset by a decline in the mobile business. For gross margin, we improved our GAAP gross margins to 41% and our non-GAAP to 41.9%. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is stock-based compensation of $3.6 million and $4.5 million for a royalty dispute. Operating expenses in the quarter were $311 million, which includes $8.3 million of restructuring costs. We are pleased with our progress in restraining our OpEx. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 5,293, which is down by 260 from the end of the second quarter. Depreciation was $49.3m, up $3 million from Q2, and capital expenditures were $109 million, that includes the Transmeta license. Within the interest and other income, there were three discrete items that caused an impairment charge totaling $8.8 million. On the tax rate, the renewal of the R&D tax credit resulted in a tax benefit for the quarter of $745,000 and a year to date tax rate of 7.7%. The result of all of this is that GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.11 for the quarter and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.20. On the balance sheet, cash and equivalents and marketable securities were $1.3 billion, which is down by $352 million from the second quarter. We repurchased $300 million worth of stock during the quarter. The operating cash flow was a positive $43 million for the quarter. Accounts receivable were $608 million, which is down $72 million from the second quarter, and DSO was 62 days, also an improvement from the second quarter. Inventory grew by 92 million quarter to quarter and the DSI grew to 90 days. The growth in inventory was primarily in new GPU products and in MCP79 as we ramped volume. We believe that channel inventory decreased slightly from Q2. And 90 days of DSI is about as high as we would want, and we will work to bring down the inventory levels in Q4. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities declined by $131 million during the quarter. On the outlook, given the economic uncertainty, it is probably unrealistic to give any outlook at all, and certainly a precise one. So I would caveat our outlook that there can be a wide range on the outcome. I also believe it is unrealistic to expect any sort of robust Christmas spending on the part of the consumer. Therefore, we believe our revenue will be down for the fourth quarter and a point estimate with a wide range of approximately 5%. The revenue line is the most difficult to forecast. We believe gross margin will be relatively flat, and operating expenses will also be relatively flat. This means that gross margin in the range of 41% and operating expenses of approximately $310 million. Other income should improve over Q3 and the tax rate for the fourth quarter should be approximately 13%. With that, I'll turn it back over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We are driving several initiatives to strengthen our competitive position while expanding into new segments and markets. First, we captured lost share in the performance segment. We have superior performance and market changing differentiators like CUDA. With our efforts this quarter, we are now properly cost positioned as well. Second, increase our exposure to the notebook market by using our new motherboard GPU to bring five times better graphics performance to Intel notebook platforms, the fastest-growing segment of the PC market. Third, with the announcement of Adobe's Creative Suite 4 and our QuadroCX accelerator for CS4, we have expanded our market footprint beyond gamers and industrial designers to include the creative generation. Gamers want performance, and with the GeForce GTX280 and 260 and the recently-announced 3-way SLI, GeForce delivers the best performance at each price point. And gamers buy new GPUs to play the latest games. The top games this fall are Crysis Warhead, Far Cry 2, Call of Duty World at War, Fallout 3, and Dead Space. Gamers will experience up to 30% faster frame rates with GeForce GTX GPUs. Enthusiasts want the fastest machines. This fall, that machine is built on Intel's new Core i7 Bloomfield CPU and our new 3-way SLI technology. And for the first time, SLI is available on SLI-licensed Intel X58 motherboards as well as nForce. Reviewers all over the world have concluded that a 3-way SLI configuration with GeForce GTX280 is unambiguously the fastest. Fast 3-D graphics is important, but the market wants and needs more than just more of the same, more than just graphics. We believe the industry must deliver new and surprising capabilities that delight and awe the world again. To do so, it requires revolutionary technology. With NVIDIA's CUDA parallel computing architecture inside every new GeForce, we believe we can. There are amazing software algorithms for applications like computer vision, image recognition, physical world simulations that are possible, but only if computers are 100 times faster. With CUDA, those capabilities are possible today. In his new GPU era, the GPU does more than just graphics. Whereas the competition has just graphics, GeForce with CUDA gives you graphics plus. Graphics plus means that your GeForce has lightning fast graphics and because of CUDA you get much more. You get physics processing on the GPU. Our PhysX physics engine enables games to do realistic simulations of physical properties in a world 20 times faster than a CPU alone, like dust blowing in the wind, water running in a stream, and natural looking clouds. The PhysX engine has been adopted by game studios all over the world. It is incorporated into the number one game engine in the world, Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine. PhysX is free to developers, and is the only physics engine that is accelerated by the 100 million GeForces in the world. A pipeline of developers and games supporting PhysX will be announced in the near future. With graphics plus, you get image and video processing. There is a ground swell of new applications enabled by CUDA, from digital photography to the excruciating process of converting movies for your iPod. Users are performing more processing-intensive tasks than ever. Elemental Technologies announced their BadaBOOM transcoder. Pegasus, Nero, CoreCodec have announced plans or demonstrated CUDA acceleration in their video processing players. AreSoft, CyberLink and Corel have announced applications that utilize the massively-parallel array of CUDA processors in our GPUs to do sophisticated computational super resolution algorithms to magically enhanced DVDs to1080p HD resolution. The result is simply awesome and frankly surprising. And finally, this quarter we will announce a groundbreaking product that is starting to create buzz throughout the industry. Stereoscopic 3-D glasses for GeForce. This is a product we have been working on for over three years. We are going to bring the 3-D experience that is sweeping the movie industry to PCs. We will reserve the exciting details for launch. We previewed this at NVISION, and the enthusiast press was entranced. BizTech wrote that \u2018I have to say the effect is amazing. I seriously didn't want to stop playing.\u2019 GotGame said that what they were seeing was pure undiluted awesome. Software developers are thrilled too. Mark Rein, the CEO of Epic Games stated that the Age of Empires Stereoscopic 3-D demo they showed in the NVISION keynote looked absolutely amazing. Stereoscopic 3-D is a great example of how consumers continue to demand more of graphics hardware. With our graphics plus initiative, we are moving the industry forward and bringing new and exciting innovations to delight the world again in a way that just graphics simply can't. The fastest-growing segment of the PC market today is notebooks. Notebooks are now 55% of all PCs shipped, 140 million units this year and growing at 25%. Although visual computing is also important for notebook users, the tight space and power constraints have caused the adoptions of GPU in notebooks to lag desktop PCs. We are addressing this by creating ever more power efficient GPUs and by integrating all of the chipset functionalities into the GPU to conserve space. A couple of weeks ago, Apple was the first company to announce our new GeForce 9400M, designed for Intel processors and which integrates three chips into one for amazing space savings. It performs five times faster than current integrated graphics. Apple was the first company to announce and today, Toshiba announced new notebooks based on 9400M. Toshiba announced a gaming notebook that has three NVIDIA GPUs inside of them, the 9400M and two 9800 GTs in SLI. There is a pipeline of design wins and new design win momentum for the 9400M is extremely strong. With the 9400M and others on our roadmap, we now have exposure to the growing notebook market like we have never had before. Another brand new market for us is the creative professionals and consumers. These are professionals who use Adobe's award-winning tools to create digital content such as movies, commercials, ads, games and Web sites; or consumers making home movies, digital photo albums, or the millions of movies that are being shared on YouTube. As the resolution of images and movies increase and as the image processing effects become ever more sophisticated, the editing experience is painful even with the fastest Quad Core CPUs. That is why Adobe and NVIDIA engineers worked so closely for the past several years to GPU accelerate all of the CS4 applications. The result is amazing. John Loiacono, Senior Vice President of Creative Solutions at Adobe, said that a critical element of CS4 was to capture the enormous power of the GPU. The difference is astounding. Performance is important to creative professionals and with the NVIDIA GPU, they are sure to be able to interact with images and videos in a much faster, smoother, more engaging way. The creative generation is significant expansion of our TAM. Adobe estimates the addressable market to be 6 million creative professionals and over 38 million creative non-professionals. To put these numbers in context, the total Quadro professional industrial design TAM today is only 4 million units. So another 44 million potential new users represents a very significant addition. We still have much work to do to be where we would like to be, but we made great strides this quarter. We transition to 55nm, and have a great lineup with graphics plus. With our single-chip notebook GPU, we have a market-changing offering for notebooks, the fastest growing segment of the PC market. And at Adobe and Quadro CX, we have expanded our TAM by over 40 million people, 40 million new visual computing users. We are happy to take your questions now.\nOperator:  Thank you. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  Thanks. I guess my first question is around your gross margin outlook; Marv, maybe a question for you. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about 55nm and a lot of discussion about that yields look like. I wonder if you can address that issue and also talk about what your ASP assumptions are in that gross margin outlook.\nMarv Burkett:  Well, we are doing just fine with 55nm. The yields are just fine. The assumption with regard to ASPs is that I think that it is exactly like we told you last quarter. We don't see major changes in ASPs in any particular segment going forward. The issue is, what is the volume of each of those segments? And I said with regard to the outlook (inaudible) probably a lot of variability in those segments. I think that Jen-Hsun would tell you that we are focused on regaining some market share in what I would call the performance and high-end portion of the desktop GPU market that would enhance ASPs. So I guess that I feel comfortable with our outlook on ASPs.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  Okay, and maybe as a follow-up, also for you, Marv; if you look out over the next four quarters or so, you pick a time frame, what is the potential for NVIDIA to do incremental cost cutting versus what you have already announced and beyond what is just the potential, what is the intention?\nMarv Burkett:  Well, the intention is to hold the line on operating expenses and grow revenue. We are totally focused on our opportunities to grow revenue. We have some significant opportunities and we do not want to jeopardize those by doing something foolish in cutting operating expenses. I am happy with the job that we have done so far, but I'm not focused on further cuts in operating expenses and focused on revenue growth.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup:  Okay, thanks.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider. Please proceed.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs:  Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just as a follow-up to the gross margin question, could you talk about your progress in the 55nm ramp, when you feel you will be at \u2013 fully on production of 55nm and how much 65nm inventory do you have remaining?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We have 65nm inventory remaining, but everything we are ramping now is 55nm; and everything on the high-end that we are shipping now is 55nm.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs:  Okay, fair enough. And I guess as a follow-up, in terms of the market that we have seen over the last few quarters, notwithstanding the macro weakness affecting desktop GPU demand, there seems to be a pretty precipitous share of shift between desktops and notebooks. Can you address your outlook over the next several quarters, whether you think that there is some kind of breakpoint where the rate of desktop share doesn't decline as much going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  The desktops \u2013 what the market shows is that desktop units are relatively flat and that the growth is coming from notebooks. It is not so much that the total units are flat and there is a shifting of units from desktop to notebooks. And so desktop units are relatively flattish and notebook growth is clearly much more significant; and our focus on the desktop is continuing to bring exciting new products and ideas to the marketplace that causes people to want to come back and buy new PCs. We have to recapture our share. We lost some market share recently and as we were transitioning and \u2013 but those things are all behind us now and we're focused on going after the share that we lost. In terms of the notebook market, we recently introduced the 9400M. This is the chip that was in the MacBook and the MacBook Air and also the MacBook Pro. And this particular chip is really amazing. It integrates three chips into one; a lot less real estate on the motherboard; much, much lower power and as a result \u2013 and it is also our first Intel processor notebook GPU, the first one we have ever built for a motherboard GPU. And so this is a very new market for us that we are growing into. You already saw the initial success that we have announced and there are many more that we would like to announce in the near future. But this is a very important growth opportunity for us. And so for the first time, we have exposure to the vast majority of the fastest-growing segment in the PC industry.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs:  Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMark Lipacis \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  Thanks for taking my question. First question, perhaps for Marv; can you give us a sense of a more normalized gross margin and operating margin target that you guys have and if you care to take a stab at when you might be able to reach that?\nMarv Burkett:  No, I won't take a stab as to when we might be able to reach it. I don't see anything long term that is an impediment for us getting back to where we were before in the mid to higher 40% range and obviously we are focused on that. In Q2, we took a step backwards, now we have to recover. Part of that recovery is going to be regaining market share in the performance enthusiast segments, part of that recovery is going to be transitioning to 55nm and beyond. So we are focused on gross margin improvement, but I do not have a timetable of when we get back.\nMark Lipacis \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  Fair enough. Second question; you are successfully transitioning into 55nm now. When would be a reasonable time to expect to see 40 nm products hit the market? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We haven't announced any 40nm products yet.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKrishna Shankar \u2013 JMP Securities:  Yes, Marv, can you give us the revenue mix in the quarter between desktop, notebook, MCPs, and professional solutions, just as approximate percentages?\nMarv Burkett:  Well, I think I did that because we said that the total GPU business was down quarter to quarter and the MCP business was up, so if you will take your baseline that you had last quarter and that data and put those growth rates or decline rates on them, you will come to the breakout of the revenue for the quarter. I don't have the percentage of the revenue within those, the total is up to 100%.\nKrishna Shankar \u2013 JMP Securities:  Okay, and then your guidance for the January quarter, are you saying basically flattish to plus or minus 5% for revenues?\nMarv Burkett:  No I think I said the point estimate was a decline of 5%.\nKrishna Shankar \u2013 JMP Securities:  Okay, all right. And then just a final question on the performance and enthusiast graphics with the new product line on 55nm, do you feel that you can continue to gain market share here in the January quarter and what is the outlook for that segment of the market, given consumer spending patterns?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We absolutely will regain market share and this is a segment where technology matters, performance matters, architecture matters, and we have the best lineup. Our challenge was never architectural leadership, our challenge was that we were caught flat footed at 65nm and our chip and board solution was just too expensive. And so, we have made that transition in Q2 and we are in Q3 and we are through that transition, and we are off and running. With respect to the robustness of the segment, historically, this segment has responded to new games. Gamers buy graphics cards to play new games, and this Christmas, we're going to have five very, very exciting new games coming out and if you are fortunate to have a GeForce GTX, your experience will be the best. And that is our focus now is to ship all these GeForces and get back to taking back share.\nKrishna Shankar \u2013 JMP Securities:  Great, thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Brian Piccioni with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nBrian Piccioni \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:  Thank you for taking my question. I notice that your days receivable seems to be contracting and of course one of the concerns that many people have in this environment is that that extends from customers being unable to pay. We have seen some smaller companies reporting similar-type experiences. I you making an effort to tighten your exposure to customers or is it basically business as usual?\nMarv Burkett:  We have always watched our receivables very, very closely, been very diligent about that credit terms and payment. So, I would say it is business as usual. We are not doing anything any differently. Our receivables, even in this environment are in very good shape, very current, no overdue receivables.\nBrian Piccioni \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:  I see. And you mentioned fairly sizable impairments, your interest and other income, would that be related to your portfolio management efforts or were these just other sort of charges that jumped out of nowhere?\nMarv Burkett:  No, it is a little bit of everything. There is some impairment on some investments that we made, there is some impairment on some of our cash investments, and there were some realized losses. But each of them individually was not significant.\nBrian Piccioni \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:  And just as a final comment, I guess more or less to be viewed as hopefully non-recurring.\nMarv Burkett:  I certainly hope so, Brian.\nBrian Piccioni \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:  Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS Investment Bank. Please go ahead.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS Investment Bank:  Thank you very much. Marv, let me just go back to the subject of the guidance. I know you said the mid point is down 5. Just concentrating on the way most companies are guiding recently, can you give us some color as to what could drive the range? I know you are not disclosing what that range this, but give us some color as to what could drive the range, because it is really tough to understand how this minus 5 midpoint, that is coming out much better than most of the companies within the industry is guiding. So can you just give us a little bit of color as to how to handicap that range please?\nMarv Burkett:  Okay, you have got to understand that there are some businesses that are less impacted by the volatility out there today. Our workstation business is very solid and obviously we have had a very good quarter last quarter. And so I view that as solid going forward. I would expect another solid area to be our MCP business with the products that Jen-Hsun talked about, the 9300, 9400M products. Those will do well and could even indicate some sort of revenue growth. The big swing factor in all of this is what happens to desktop revenue. And as Jen-Hsun says, we are focused on regaining some market share in that area, but my caution tells me that it could be a weak market in the fourth quarter. So those are sort of the factors driving that outlook.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS Investment Bank:  Now that is helpful. Let me just ask you another question; were there any impacts from licensing the SLI for X58 motherboards within this quarter?\nMarv Burkett:  There was no revenue impact.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS Investment Bank:  Okay, and then just another question. This is for Jen-Hsun. With the three GPU notebook announced by Toshiba, how much more of this type of notebooks should we expect to see, is there any pipeline for such coming, Jen-Hsun?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  You know, we probably shouldn't announce our customers\u2019 products on their behalf, but the basic technology is combining SLI and hybrid GPU into one system. So, in one mode, the 9400M is a chipset, it's an SLI chipset and it communicates with the external dual GeForce 9800 GT GPUs; and in another mode, the 9400M is the graphics chip so that the two 9800 GTs could be shut off and conserve battery power. And so, this is the way \u2013 this technique is a way to both get very, very high-performance for gamers, while considering battery life whenever they are not playing games. So it is a really fabulous technique for delivering that discontinuity, if you will. So this is a technique that I think other people may decide to adopt.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS Investment Bank:  And then just one last question, Marv. Your inventory exiting next quarter, if you do hit the minus 5 midpoint guidance, how should we think about inventory given the jump we have seen in the current quarter, what should be a target for we should model inventory for the next quarter?\nMarv Burkett:  I don't know about the end of next quarter. If we achieve that target, we would see inventory coming down probably. So we still have the same target of inventory in the 60 to 75 days of DSI. That is still our target.\nUche Orji \u2013 UBS Investment Bank:  Okay, good. Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan Securities. Please proceed.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Yes, thank you. Hi guys. I would like to I just poke around on gross margins a little bit more. What percentage of your mix in Q3 was 55nm GPUs, you had mentioned the high end you are moving over aggressively. I am just trying to get a quantitative sense as to the mix now and for Q4.\nMarv Burkett:  Well, most of high-end were 65nm in Q3.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I would say across the board, most of our volumes were 65nm. You are talking about what we shipped.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  That\u2019s right.\nMarv Burkett:  Yes. What we shipped was 65nm, what we built was all 55nm. And what we are shipping now is mostly 55nm.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Okay. Is it true that the chipset gross margins right now are greater than your desktop gross margins?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes, they are close.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  They are close?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I would say that you are probably right. But it is not a huge difference.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities: \n \u2013 :\nMarv Burkett:  Yes for Q3.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Backward looking for the quarter, I would be surprised if forward looking, if it is the same way.\nMarv Burkett:  Yes. What Jen-Hsun is saying is he expects improvement in the GPU margins going forward and the MCP margins are going to be relatively flat.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Okay. And as it relates to the sequential change in your gross margins, is that mostly mix or is there a segment-by-segment unit cost reduction or changes in things sequentially. Can you kind of walk us through the moving pieces?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  There is all of the above. In some cases you are getting transition, more 55nm, less 65nm, that helps. In other cases you are ramping up and experiencing revenue growth in a lower gross margin line, i.e., MCP. You are going to have lower revenue in a high gross margin line, Sony royalties. So, it\u2019s all mixed together.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Okay. And what were your memory sales in Q3?\nMarv Burkett:  $22.3 million.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Okay. And then last one from me. When you look at your order book and your visibility right now is it the same, better or worse than this time when you set your guidance last quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  No visibility in either case.\nShawn Webster \u2013 J.P. Morgan Securities:  Okay. So, no change there. Okay, thank you.\nMarv Burkett:  Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  Yes. I was just curious that you haven\u2019t really talked about a lot of products. But we haven\u2019t talked about consumer products, and in particular, Tegra. Can you talk about those kind of products tend to have a good Christmas, maybe this year is different. And I was wondering when Tegra will begin to contribute to revenue? And what about design win activities, that kind of stuff? \nMarv Burkett:  Tegra is doing really well. And I\u2019ve said that Tegra was not ready for production this year because the design win process tends to be longer. And I also have said that Tegra is coming out party is really spring of next year. So, I look forward to talking to you much more about that, spring of next year.\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  Okay, how is the consumer business in the meantime?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  What do you mean by consumer business, David?\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  You know you folks still have some graphics business with Motorola?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes, it is insignificant. \nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  Insignificant?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Insignificant, David. Yes. \nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  Essentially, I shouldn\u2019t worry about that at all in Q4?\nJen-Hsun Huang: \n, :\n :\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  Okay. Marv, if I look at next year, your different segment of the business, I would assume that I should get growth out of your chipset, that\u2019s the highest probably of absolute revenue growth. And then Tegra should be behind that. In a difficult economic environment, if you execute well on GPU side, can you actually grow revenue at all?\nMarv Burkett:  The answer, I think is yes. But don\u2019t forget Tesla. I mean, in terms of significant revenue growth, obviously Tegra and the MCP business; but Tesla is also in that same category.\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  That\u2019s tens of millions of dollars?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We hope it is more than that. Here is the way I would break it down. GeForce desktop, our growth opportunity comes from capturing share back. Our MCP business, obviously greater exposure to notebook is a wonderful thing. Then Quadro is a growth business, Tesla is a growth business, and Tegra is a growth business. We know those three product lines are all going to grow next year.\nDavid Wu \u2013 Global Crown Capital:  I see. Okay. Thank you.\nMarv Burkett:  Thank you, David.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with American Technology Research. Please proceed.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter you made a significant comment about the demand you were seeing in the marketplace regarding mix shift. Can you tell us if you\u2019ve seen a continuation there, any changes and \u2013 just an update?\nMarv Burkett:  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any change. I think the \u2013 are you referring to, Doug, the \u2013 what we call the sort of disappearance of the low end of the discreet desktop?\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  Correct.\nMarv Burkett:  Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any change to that. That\u2019s becoming in our view a mobile market.\nJen-Hsun Huang: \n :\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  All right. Can you update us as far as ongoing negotiations to secure capacity at leading edge nodes going forward? I know there were some concerns about your partner committing enough capital to meet the demands of a $4 billion company. Can you discuss any progress you may have had there?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Well, I would think there was \u2013 I am hoping that we grow next year. And I think we have a good shot growing next year. But considering there is so many people are backing out of orders and reducing inventory and slow on wafer starts and thinks like that. I would think that getting capacity would be a lesser concern now than before. And 40nm is a solid node, but so as 55nm. And we\u2019ll use as much of both as we can. And so what continue to work with TSMC and they\u2019re our wonderful partner. We both obviously want to make sure that whatever opportunities are there in the marketplace for us that we are both doubtful about going after it. So, I think we are both on the same side of the table.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  And my last one, Marv, just a little bit of a housekeeping question for you. You\u2019ve spent $300 million buying back shares, did you have an average share price to that or can you offer us some guidance on where you think the share count will be next quarter?\nMarv Burkett:  Price was $12.99. I thought it was a bargain at that time. Now I have no comment about the shares going forward. That would be a function of a lot of different things, options issues, people leaving, repurchasing, anything.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  What\u2019s left on the repurchase authorization?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  About $1.3 billion.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 American Technology Research:  Great. Thank you.\nMarv Burkett:  Thanks, Doug.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James: \n :\nJen-Hsun Huang:  It is really, really hard to do. If you think about the current PC architecture, to deliver that functionality requires four chips. And now with the new laptops with 9400M, it only requires two chips, the CPU and the GPU. We know that Intel is working towards two chip architecture as well, the CPU and then the chipset. And as you know by now that project has delayed by a year now. And so, it is hard to do. It\u2019s a lot of functionality to integrate into one chip. And it took us a fair amount of work to build something like that for the notebook as well. So, now we have a chassis. It sits next to an amazing processor, the Core 2 Duo; the best processor that frankly anybody in the world has ever built. And it is fast and it is low power. And so between the Core 2 Duo and 9400M, it makes a wonderful notebook. So, our intention is to introduce a few more versions of this chassis and continue to enhance the experience of notebooks going forward. And so that\u2019s \u2013 so I am really, really excited about 9400M. This was a very, very hard project for us, and for anybody in the world to have accomplished them. And so I think this is an investment that\u2019s going to payoff for several years.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James:  Okay. Thanks. And as a quick follow up, is there any update on or status on the notebook GPU recall, you guys took a charge for last quarter. And is there any risk to a desktop recall on that same \u2013\nJen-Hsun Huang:  It has been relatively quite actually. And we are working with all the OEM still. And nothing has really changed. And so, I don\u2019t know that there is anything new to report. We are working \u2013 everything was \u2013 so far, things are consistent with our model, if not a little bit better than that. And so we are just working with our OEMs and making sure that, number one, they understand the issues and that they are taking immediate and appropriate steps to improve whatever thermal management techniques are available in the notebooks; and then working with them to support the end users, if an end user where to report a problem. And so, that\u2019s our strategy and we are focused on that. Nothing has really changed this quarter.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James:  Okay. Thank you very much.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes. Thanks a lot Hans.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nTim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Thank you so much. Could you in this conference just remind us with respect to the new architecture what sort of time line you are looking at in terms of introducing that next year? And then just a follow on the prior question, what are the key milestones in terms of getting thorough clearance associated with any of the issues lingering from the recall or the issues that you had in terms of write down that you\u2019ve already taken, I think $196 million?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Tim, I had to admit, I didn\u2019t completely understand your English. First part of it, I am sorry about that. The second question I think I do know the answer to. We have completely transitioned out of that material set. All of our OEMs are perfectly comfortable with a new material set. And we are seeing no impediments and issues anywhere as a result of that. If anything at all, our OEMs are pleased that we stand behind our products, and that we are working with them to overcome the issue for both of us.\nTim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital:  So, you think that the $196 million is going to cover it for sure?\nMarv Burkett:  Well, don\u2019t know until we are done. But our \u2013 nothing that we\u2019ve seen so far would suggest that we should change it at this time. What was your first question?\nTim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital:  First question was in terms of the major offering initiative, you go from 65nm, 55nm, then down to 40nm, you have in terms of new products, a new architecture I believe that\u2019s likely to come out in the middle of calendar \u201909. Do you have any updates there in terms of A, the time line and, two, what some of the milestones maybe for that offering?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  I see. If you told you, then the competition would know that too. So, I find myself \u2013 I want to tell you, I can wait to tell you. It\u2019s going to be a fabulous processor. It is \u2013 we are working really hard on it. It is a very, very large undertaking. And building a new architecture of this magnitude, it\u2019s a multi-$100 million undertaking anymore. So, it\u2019s a big, big deal. I\u2019m very excited about it, and I can wait to tell you about it, hopefully next year.\nTim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Do you think that that is a key point in terms of share either increasing, again for you, or do you think the 40nm introduction before that maybe a turning point in terms of market share dynamics?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  We lost some share recently because of our transition and our competition surprised us with a significantly lower cost and we won\u2019t cut off guard and we shouldn\u2019t have been. But we\u2019ll not cut off guard now and it\u2019s time for us to go get our market share back. We have a better architecture, and our architecture is much, much more robust in a lot of different ways, much more futures. It\u2019s not just graphics. It has physics processing and has image processing and video processing, and I mentioned earlier that we are going to introduce really amazing new capability called Stereoscopic 3D. And so those capabilities are simply not available when you just have a graphics chip. And so our focus as a company is to expand the GPU market. We are trying to expand the GPU market by enabling the GPU to do more than just graphics. And so, we are going to continue to do that. And over the years, we have increased the size of the GPU beyond any one\u2019s expectations. And I think that our imagination surely at the moment exceeds everybody\u2019s expectation in the world today. And so I think that you are going to find GPUs and supercomputing clusters. You are going to find GPUs, multiple GPUs in your workstations. Some of it for graphics, some of it for computing. You are going to see GPUs used or video editing and image processing, and physics simulations. And GPUs will become more and more valuable and do more and more computation for your PC. So, I think that is our primary focus. So, I expect that we are going to continue to grow our GPU business and grow the overall GPU, Tim, because of our innovations.\nTim Luke \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Thank you, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thank you.\nOperator:  We have no more time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to reporting our progress for Q4. \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for today. Thank you for joining us and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Good afternoon and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter ended July 27, 2008. On the call today for NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marv Burkett, NVIDIA's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to take care of some general administrative items. Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call. During this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures about diluted net income per share, tax rate, and gross margin when talking about our results. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on the investor relations page of our website at www.nvidia.com. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or John Petty Research. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. Also, shareholders can listen to a live webcast of today\u2019s call via the investor relations page of our website.

Therefore, questions around our financial expectations should be asked during this call. At the end of our remarks, there will be time for your questions. In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response, we will allow one follow-up question. With that, I will now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q2 was a challenge for NVIDIA. We reported revenue of $893 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.13, significantly below our original expectations. The simultaneous impact of desktop PC end market weakness around the world, adjustments of our desktop GPU ASPs in response to competitive pricing, and the delayed ramp of our next generation MCP substantially contributed to our revenue shortfall.  We also noted that we would be taking a non-recurring charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty, repair/return replacement and other associated costs resulting from a weak die/packaging material set in certain previous generation GPU and MCP products using notebooks. Although the failures are only seen in a small percentage of all the chips we shipped with this material set, the repair cost of a notebook can be expensive. In total, we took a charge of $196 million. We will continue to support on OEM partners on responding and resolving end customer issues.  We underestimated the price performance of our competitor\u2019s most recent GPU, which led us to mis-position our fall lineup. The first step of our response was to reset our price to reflect competitive realities. Our action put us again in a strong competitive position but we took hard hits with respect to our overall GPU ASPs and ultimately to our gross margins. The price action was particularly difficult since we are just ramping 55-nanometer and the weak market resulted in taking longer than expected to work through our 65-nanometer inventory. Throughout the second quarter, we observed a general weakness in the desktop GPU segment, consistent with the results published in Mercury Research Q208 Graphics Report, desktop standalone GPU shipments declined over 23% from the first quarter, mostly in the low-end GPU segments. We believe the decline was primarily due to a weak economic environment, driving a mix shift to lower priced PCs, as well as a continued mix shift to notebook PCs.  Until we can offer motherboard graphics for Intel platforms, our penetration of notebooks and low cost PCs will remain low. We hope to start production this quarter.  There were several bright spots in our business. We see continued strength in our professional solutions business. The Quadro business grew 38% over last year. The mobile workstation marketplace is growing at 30% a year and over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve gone from around a 40% share of this market to over 90% share.  Despite the challenges we faced in the second quarter, we remain optimistic about our growth opportunities. There are a number of steps we are taking now and in the next several quarters to regain our growth momentum, which I will outline later in the call.  Let me now turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. My remarks today will cover the second quarter of fiscal \u201909, including comments regarding both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter. Included in the quarterly results is a charge of $196 million to cost of revenue for a warranty issue, which we previously disclosed. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is this warranty charge and the charges for stock-based compensation. A full reconciliation is included in our press release and on our website.  As Jen-Hsun stated earlier, revenue for the quarter was $893 million, which is down 23% from Q1 and down 5% from the prior year. The issues with regard to revenue in the quarter are almost entirely focused on the desktop GPU segment. Desktop GPU revenue was down 40% quarter to quarter and down 25% year to year. The remainder of the business combined was down 10% quarter to quarter and up 11% year to year.  Desktop GPU units declined by 20% but more importantly, desktop ASPs declined by 25% quarter to quarter. Jen-Hsun has already gone over the issues here, so I won\u2019t repeat them.  Notebook GPU revenue was actually up quarter to quarter by 8% and up 43% year over year. Professional solutions revenue decreased by 12% quarter to quarter as expected after an exceptionally strong Q1. Memory in the quarter was down by 41% to $21 million.  The decline in both desktop unit volume and ASPs created significant pressure on margins. The 25% decline in ASPs falls directly to the margins. As a result, overall corporate margin decreased to 16.8% for GAAP and 39.1% for non-GAAP. The decline in desktop ASPs did not carry over into notebook. Notebook ASPs were relatively flat quarter to quarter.  GAAP operating expenses were $305 million, down almost $7 million quarter to quarter. We were able to start the process of limiting OpEx growth. During the quarter, we added 195 new employees and ended the quarter at 5,553 employees. Much of the growth in the quarter was new college graduates.  Depreciation in the quarter was $46 million, up about $5 million from Q1. Capital expenditures were $63 million, which is down $139 million from Q1. However, the Q1 capital additions included $150 million for the purchase of property in Santa Clara. The Q2 additions of $63 million included $25 million of test equipment.  Despite all of the issues, cash flow from operations was still positive in the amount of $90 million for the quarter. Interest income and other was $9 million, which is down about $1 million from the first quarter, primarily due to lower than average cash balances and lower interest rates during the quarter.  The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 17% while the GAAP tax rate was a benefit. Going forward, we expect the GAAP tax rate to be 23% and the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 17% for Q3 unless the R&D tax credit is renewed in the quarter.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was a negative $0.22 per diluted share and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.13 per diluted share.  There were no stock repurchases during the quarter. However, this week, our board of directors approved an increase in our stock repurchase program from $1.7 billion to $2.7 billion. Through July 27, 2008, we have repurchased 68 million shares under our existing stock purchase program, for a total cost of $1.16 billion.  On the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities were $1.66 billion, which is up $36 million quarter to quarter. Accounts receivable were $679 million, up $28 million, and DSO was at 69 days. This reflects the profile of shipments during the quarter. We have not experienced any problems with receivables.  Inventory was $432 million, up only $12 million quarter to quarter as we did a good job moderating production volumes.  Accrued liabilities, which is up $247 million in the quarter, includes the accrual for the warranty charge. There are no other highlights on the balance sheet.  On the outlook, revenue will be the most difficult to forecast. We are expecting our market for desktop PCs to grow less than seasonal. While we expect growth in MCP, Sony, and desktop, other business units may be flat to slightly down. Therefore, we expect total revenue to grow slightly.  For gross margins, we would expect small improvements until we can make the transition to 55-nanometer. This is in process but we have inventory of the 65-nanometer parts which will have to be sold first.  Operating expenses will be up from the second quarter approximately 5% but we will try to reduce that growth as much as possible.  The GAAP tax rate will be 23% and the non-GAAP tax rate will be 17%.  With that, I will turn it back to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. The visual computing universe is expanding and is driving exciting growth opportunities for the GPU. Visual computing is no longer just about graphics. We are driving revolutionary advances in four distinct areas -- photorealistic rendering, image processing, such as video processing and computational photography, parallel processing for the simulation of complex algorithms like real world physical properties, and rich displays, such as 3D touch U.I. and 3D stereoscopic displays.  We have been innovating and investing in these four areas for some time and plan to launch products and initiatives soon.  At the core of these growth strategies is CUDA, our general purpose, massively parallel computing architecture. CUDA is a new mode in all of our GPUs, starting with the GeForce 8 family. CUDA is not GP/GPU. The programming model is not triangles and texture maps. When in the CUDA mode, our GeForce Quadro Tesla processors behave like a general purpose processor and is programmed using C and a C compiler. Nearly 100 million CUDA compatible processors have already shipped in desktop PCs, notebook PCs, and workstations. Our GPUs are CUDA compatible from top to bottom.  And the many years of products on our development pipeline are all CUDA compatible. CUDA is already the world\u2019s highest volume parallel computing architecture and the adoption of CUDA is accelerating. Developers all over the world are using CUDA to dramatically accelerate their applications, ranging from nano-molecular dynamics, computational photography, end body simulation for astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, such as options risk analysis, and tomographic reconstruction.  Developers are seeing accelerations ranging from 10X to 300X. CUDA is clearly revolutionizing super-computing around the world and dramatically accelerating the time to discovery from life sciences research to the search for alternative energy sources.  Over 100,000 copies of the CUDA C compiler have already been downloaded since we launched CUDA almost two years ago, and nearly 52,000 copies of the CUDA C compiler were downloaded in Q2 alone, and the rate continues to grow rapidly.  HPC Wire readers chose CUDA as the most significant HPC, which stands for high performance computing, software of 2007. Our website links to over 100 published papers that reference CUDA, but we estimate many times that have been published worldwide.  Over 50 schools and universities worldwide now include CUDA as part of their computer science curriculum or in their research. We recently sponsored a new parallel computing lab at Stanford University and appointed the first two CUDA centers of excellence, the University of Utah and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Both universities are leaders in parallel computing and like many others, have adopted CUDA. We are honored by their investment around CUDA and thrilled by the work that they are doing in parallel computing.  CUDA has opened up a new and exciting market to us. With our Tesla product line, we are poised to revolutionize a new class of personal super computers. Through CUDA, we have discovered a pent-up demand of researchers around the world desperate for super-computing performance but cannot afford the enormous expense to run and maintain a super computing cluster. We will even revolutionize super computing clusters. Because of the dramatic acceleration using CUDA, our Tesla product line will reduce the space and power consumption of clusters by 10 to 20 times. This translates to either more performance possible in any server room or millions in energy savings each year.  Linux Magazine likened the introduction of GPU computing to the great cluster disruption that transformed data centers in the 80s. They added that we could be at the beginning of another paradigm shift.  We will start to ship our Tesla processors this quarter. The Tesla C1060 computing is the world\u2019s first teraflops processor, while the S1070 teraflops -- a few missing words there -- delivers four teraflops per one new configuration. Tesla and CUDA look to be change agents for a multi-billion dollar market.  One of the most important applications of CUDA is the simulation of physical properties of objects and environments. The most popular demo at the press launch of the GeForce GTX 280 was the natural motions backbreaker. Backbreaker uses NVIDIA's PhysX engine to simulate the motion of players.  PhsyX is the world\u2019s most pervasive physics engine available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, and PC. PhsyX allows game developers to use physical world simulation on the GPU to create content automatically, making the game feel and behave like the real world.  We have registered over 26,000 developers using PhsyX and are seeing over 4,000 PhsyX SDK downloads per month. Nearly every game in development today will incorporate PhsyX simulation to enhance realism while moderating the escalating cost of game art.  The PhsyX engine runs on any PC; however, when accelerated by a CUDA compatible GPU, effects like cloth, soft body, particle, and fluid simulations can speed up 10 times over a quad-core CPU alone. PhsyX adoption is accelerating rapidly. Game engines, including Unreal engine 3, Gambrio, Trinigy use it. Middleware developers such as Natural Motion, AISeek, Speed Tree are licensees. There are over 150 titles shipping and well over 200 titles currently in development.  The visual computing revolution is happening and it is all around us. On August 25th to 27th, along with companies worldwide contributing to the visual computing universe, we are hosting NVision 2008, the world\u2019s first mega even dedicated to the visual computing movement. This will be one of the largest events ever held in San Jose and will be attended by game developers, designers, artists, programmers, engineers, scientists, researchers, system OEMs, and gamers and technology enthusiasts from all over the world.  For gamers, NVision \u201908 includes a massive LAN party and the finals of the Electronic Sports World Cup.  For artist, we\u2019re hosting Demo Scene, Machinima using games to create movies, and digital art events.  We\u2019ll have an exclusive showing of the new 3D movie, Fly me to the Moon, hosted by Buzz Aldrin and its director, Ben Stassen. We\u2019ll have technical tracks for content creators, developers, artists, and scientists.  We are also hosting the emerging company summit in which 60 new companies meet the financial community to discuss breakthrough products using the power of visual computing.  We got tripped up in Q2. Some things we can\u2019t control but there are many things we can. We\u2019ve dusted ourselves off and we are now intensely focused on changes and improvements that will enhance our performance in the future.  For all who have followed NVIDIA over the years, you know what we can achieve when challenged. We will surely overcome this challenge as well, meanwhile continuing to drive the visual computing revolution we started.  We\u2019d be happy to take your questions now. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Cowen & Company:   Thanks very much. Jen-Hsun, when you talk about gross margin improvement and you talk about improving slightly until you fully get to 55-nanometer, how should we think about that trajectory over the next couple of quarters? And then, how much of the gross margin improvement is going to be because pricing has now stabilized because you have readjusted your products to the right price points and how much of that comes from cost improvements?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, with respect to the price adjustment, our price going into Computext, which was the June timeframe, was just wrong and we miscalculated the competition. Now that we\u2019ve properly calculated and gauged the competition, we\u2019ve reset our price to it and we have a strong position going into the fall.  So my expectation is that pricing is going to be stable going forward. From this point out, I guess the real focus is gross margin improvement.  There\u2019s all kinds of levers we could pull and we ought to be working on all of them. You\u2019ve seen us improve our gross margins in the past and we will improve our gross margins going forward, so the company, as you can imagine, is very, very focused in this area now and even more focused in the past, and so we just have to go figure out how to get our costs in line and our gross margins back up.  It\u2019s not a singular thing that explains it all away. Our situation was particularly aggravated because we were the first to 65. We had such a large momentum of 65-nanometer products and when the market slowed down unexpectedly for us, we ended up with a lot more 65-nanometer capacity than -- or inventory than we like.  All of our products are now 55-nanometer and all of them are ready to ramp and many of them have ramped but until we consume the 65-nanometer capacity, or inventory, excuse me, we\u2019re not really going to be able to benefit from the cost reductions of the 55.  But that\u2019s not the only thing that we need to do. I mean, the company needs to do a lot more and I expect the various groups around the company to be doing a lot more in gross margin improvements. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Cowen & Company:   Okay. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney with FTN Midwest. Please proceed.\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest: I had a question about the charges and your view of what might still be out there. There are some concerns that there may be more product failure than in your opening remarks. Jen-Hsun, you remarked that you felt like you were going to continue to support the partners. Do you see that support leading to potential more write-downs in the future?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re not expecting more write-downs in the future. When we scoped out the problem, we had -- we felt we had enough data to project out the anticipated failures from the various platforms that are out there. This doesn\u2019t happen to all of our chips and it doesn\u2019t happen to most of the notebooks that are out there. There are only a few examples of them and of all the notebooks that have shipped. So we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation but -- and we thought that we were relatively conservative but we\u2019ll see how it goes. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Midwest: Okay, and then if I could, just a question on the motherboard GPU product. You remarked that you were ramping production. When do you think that becomes -- could you give us a timeframe for when that becomes a more significant share of your revenues, and perhaps give us some numerical targets that we should expect in terms of the share of output?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I can tell you that we are building a lot of them right now. I can tell you that from a technology perspective, it is a solid year to maybe year-and-a-half ahead of what the competitor has in this space. In terms of GPU computing and -- you know, many core programmable processing on the motherboard, it is the only solution for from what I can tell several years out. So we have a very significant advantage relative to the competition.  We also have some very exciting design wins -- nothing that we can announce today but hopefully we\u2019ll learn about them in the near future. So this is an important project for us. We\u2019ve put a lot of engineering into it and I am expecting it to be a really exciting product. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Morgan. Please proceed.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: I just wanted to talk real quickly about desktop GPU again. Can you help us better understand what you are expecting in terms of timeline for the desktop GPU to stabilize? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I wish I could tell you. Part of it has to do with the economy. Some of it has to do with the U.S. currency and what we found is that there was a pretty strong shift from mid-range desktop PC segments or products to entry PC and some of it to notebook. And so -- and we also saw that the U.S. OEMs were stronger because of the weak dollar relative to the European system builders. And our European business tends to be substantially larger in terms of GPU attach.  And so there\u2019s a lot of things that conspired against us but at the core of it, I think that the weak economy played a pretty significant role. We didn\u2019t really -- we didn\u2019t lose any share. The marketplace just -- the market just got soft on us and so it\u2019s hard to say exactly when it\u2019s going to recover but I think that time will tell. \nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: And then just a quick question on gross margins, and I guess two parts here; first off, I understand you guys have some 65-nanometer inventory to work through. How much is there and how long does it take? And then second, if Marv, you could talk about some of the moving parts on gross margins in Q3, fiscal Q3. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, how long it takes us to work through it depends on how many we sell in each quarter. I think we\u2019ll see some improvement in Q3 and some improvement in Q4 in the transition to 55-nanometer. We\u2019ll have to see how quickly we work through that inventory.  Some of the moving parts on gross margin going forward is that I think as Jen-Hsun said, we\u2019ve seen prices stabilize in the desktop GPU area, so the improvement in gross margin there is going to have to come from cost reduction. In MCT, which will become we think an increasing portion of our business, obviously it is not at the gross margins of the rest of the company, so that could be a slight drag. Offsetting that, we expect nice growth from the Sony arrangement, which is obviously very, very high gross margins, so that would be a benefit. So there\u2019s lots of moving parts. When you put it all together, we expect some slight improvement in gross margins. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda with Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed.\nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: A couple of questions; one, could you talk a little bit about your handheld and Tesla and Tegra product lines, what sort of revenue expectations you have, either for later this year or maybe possibly next year? And I have a follow-up, please. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Tegra is doing very, very well. The design wins are -- I think everybody would be excited about the design wins when they come out, and the engineering teams are heads down trying to ship these products. They won\u2019t ship until the early part of next year and so I\u2019m not expecting any revenue contribution from Tegra this year but hopefully next year it becomes a real business and hopefully a real substantial business.  Tesla, you know, this is a brand new category for the world and this is not a -- this is using GPUs for super-computing and it\u2019s not GP/GPUs as I explained earlier but it\u2019s the CUDA mode of GPUs. It\u2019s an array of general purpose processors with a modern CPU instruction set that\u2019s compilable by C and C++ in the future and this is a revolutionary product. I mean, if you look at the speed-ups, it took us nearly 20 years to improve the performance of computers by 1,000 times and yet, over the course of one year, researchers are discovering they can speed things up by 20, 50, 300 times using one GPU. And when you put more GPUs in the system, you get linear speed-up. And so this is revolutionary stuff and we are getting just an enormous amount of enthusiasm around the world. And despite the availability of Tesla, people are building homemade super computers in universities all over the world. I mean, as I traveled the world this last summer, every university I went to has a home-made super computer based on NVIDIA's technology.  So I think that this is a market that is eager for disruptive product and as such, it\u2019s kind of hard to predict exactly how big the market is going to be. But I think that there are quite a few researchers around the world and they are all desperate for more super computing horsepower to advance their research.  And so I think my back-of-the-envelope would suggest this is a multi-billion dollar business opportunity and if you look at the number of CPUs that are sold into clusters, we have an opportunity to really, really dramatically capture a lot of that share. \nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: I have one follow-up on your [TT200] series. I think you said that you haven\u2019t loss share and it\u2019s been a pricing issue. It seems like your competitor is getting reasonably good reviews, so do you think that you are going to maintain your share but your gross margin is going to be lower because of having to lower prices? Or does 55-nanometer kind of correct that, where you can -- your margins will go up and your share will be maintained? What sort of dynamics do you expect there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our competition has built a nice product but nobody ever said that our product isn\u2019t awesome and the nice things that people write about their product is that it\u2019s well-priced. But if you take a look at our products, the GeForce GTX, it\u2019s not only a great graphics product. Because of CUDA, we\u2019re going to be able to accelerate physics in the hundreds of games that are out there and you saw early review, or you should be seeing early reviews of our physics processing and all of the reviews are fabulous. I mean, what\u2019s not to like about increasing performance by 10 times? And so there\u2019s a lot of exciting things that we are doing around physics.  CUDA also enables transcoding and video processing and we know that video transcoding is probably one of the killer apps around the world today. I don\u2019t know how many million PCs are running all night long transcoding a move to put it onto an iPod. If we could just make it super real-time, just think about the amount of energy we are going to save for the world.  And so millions and millions and millions of PCs are spending all their nights cranking on video transcoding and we are going to make it so that you can transcode faster than real-time. And that\u2019s a capability that we have, and we invested in CUDA and so our GPU is slightly larger. Our computing performance, if you look at using folding at home as a surrogate, which is a Stanford approaching folding application that -- it\u2019s the only application, in fact, that runs on a CPU, a cell processor, and GPUs. And if you compared our performance to that of our competition, it\u2019s not just 50% faster -- it\u2019s four times faster. And so our computing performance is really, really good and it\u2019s an area that we\u2019ve invested a great deal in, and it makes our die size a little larger but I also believe that this is how we are going to revolutionize visual computing.  We can\u2019t just keep selling chips that make graphics run faster and cheaper. I mean, that\u2019s all very nice and it\u2019s all good but we need to advance the visual computing field in some remarkable and important way, and parallel computing is one of the most important investments that we are making.  So take a look at the stuff that we are rolling out now. People are really excited about the price points that they see and then on top of that, you get all the benefits of CUDA and GPU processing that we bring, and physics processing that we bring. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ernst with Hudson Square Research. Please proceed.\nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Three quick questions, if I might -- do you see any second order impacts from the chip packaging issue on notebooks? Is there any loss of design wins that could come out of that issue with your OEM partners? Two, with the rise of the ASUS EEPCs and all the many look-alikes and the [inaudible], the new Dell network out today, do you see that having an impact on your overall notebook market share or do you think you have a roll in those ultra-light portables? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Frankly, on the work that we are doing supporting our OEMs to help them repair and to support their end users, frankly all of our engagement with all of our OEMs, they have been just delighted by the work that we are doing. Obviously this isn\u2019t something we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think it\u2019s the right thing to do. And so each case is a little different, so we have to look at each case carefully but our open-minded approach and our good partnership approach is welcomed by all the OEMs. And so if this is going to be anything at all, it should be a positive.  I missed some of the early parts of your second question but I think it is related to the ultra mobile PC. We don\u2019t really have any offerings in that space. We have offerings in the space that I think is probably even more important, which is the mobile Internet device. The single most important mobile Internet device today is the iPhone and that is much, much smaller and has a much more rigorous thermal and computing requirement than what is possible for a new MPC, if you will. And I know exactly how to use an iPhone and I know exactly what kind of enthusiasm the market has for it, but a UMPC, I haven\u2019t figured out exactly how to use. So I think that the MID is a real important area. We are doing to see hundreds and hundreds of millions of MID/smartphones that come out over the course of the next several years and I think this is going to be the second personal computer revolution and Tegra is designed to hit that sweet spot, and so that\u2019s our focus.  \nDaniel Ernst - Hudson Square Research: Understood -- to follow-up on both those, maybe just a few more, on the back-end, is there an opportunity to recoup some of the costs that you are having on fulfilling the OEM [inaudible] program, either warranty or recoupment from your packaging partners, where the issue derived from? And then a follow-up on the MID question -- so Jen-Hsun, are you saying that you don\u2019t believe the ultra mobile, UMPC market will be large enough to address or you just don\u2019t think your technology addresses that type of computer?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have no comments about the recouping. We don\u2019t know and it\u2019s too early to tell.  With respect to UMPC, that\u2019s just not our target. I mean, there are a lot of things that are not our targets and that just happens to be one of the things that is not our target. We are much more targeted at the MID and the smartphone marketplace where we think that the segment is desperate for a well-designed computer on a chip, and that\u2019s what Tegra is, and we also think that\u2019s an area that is where growth could be really significant. So that\u2019s our target and that\u2019s our focus and frankly, from our initial engagements with the marketplace, we\u2019re delighted by that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Jen-Hsun, a couple of questions; the way NVIDIA introduced GPUs into the marketplace, a single GPU at the high-end and you cascade going forward into higher volume segments -- has that strategy changed in relation to what AMD has done here with their strategy?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hans, you might recall, we were actually the world\u2019s first GX2 and I forget which chip we did it with -- was it 7900? I think it was 7900 we introduced the world\u2019s first GX2.  We\u2019ve got nothing against GX2s and recently, we just had another GX2 with the 9800 GX2. It has its advantages and disadvantages and so I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any particular philosophical approach that we take here. We just have to look at the market and build the right product.  From a scalability perspective, single-chip is always better than two. I mean, if you take a look at the scalability of crossfire and you compare that to SLI, if you take your top 200 most popular games, SLI or GeForce GTX 280, the scalability across those 200 games is 100%. Every one of those 200 games are going to scale when you put a GTX on it. When you put SLI on it, those 200 games, the vast majority of them will scale, maybe 90% of them will scale. And with crossfire, a lot less will scale. And so when you use an X2 with crossfire, you are just going to see a lot less scalability. There are many games that don\u2019t scale and there are some games that even get worse in scaling.  So you just have to take it case by case and -- but we think our approach is the right approach. The best approach is to do both. If we could offer a single chip solution at 399, it certainly doesn\u2019t preclude us from building a two-chip solution at something higher. So I think that having the right price, right product at each price point and the best-performing product at each price point is the most important thing.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Okay, and a quick follow-up then -- thanks, Jen-Hsun -- the current headcount, are you guys comfortable with that, given the current environment? A lot of silicon valley companies have cut heads and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s something that you guys are thinking about. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Our OpEx is too high and we need to moderate that and the management team is very focused on moderating that. The first thing to do is just stop growing the OpEx. Now, we had a lot of things that were scheduled for the second half of the year that we are very committed to and we think it\u2019s the right thing to do, one of which was NVision 2008. This is a very, very important event for the visual computing industry to have. It\u2019s the first one and it\u2019s a recognition that the visual computing industry, the visual computing ecosystem or the visual computing universe or movement is here, that there are hundreds of companies that can participate in visual computing and come to a conference that\u2019s dedicated to visual computing. So I think that\u2019s a really, really important investment to make and we are going to continue to do that.  There are other initiatives that we are really committed to do. For example, the launch of all of the CUDA applications and products that are derived from CUDA are just coming out. You know, although researchers around the world have been benefiting from CUDA, most consumers have not and we are going to launch exciting products this second half related to that, and so that\u2019s really, really important for us to do and it\u2019s going to really significantly differentiate our product stream. Instead of just graphics processing, we\u2019re going to do parallel processing and physics processing and image processing and video processing and we are just going to keep rolling those things out because CUDA makes it possible. And so those efforts need marketing support and we are committed to do that.  So there are some preplanned OpEx increases already but aside from that, we need to make sure that we do our best to moderate or improve our OpEx and bring it back in line relative to our business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with American Technology Partners. Please proceed.\nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: Jen-Hsun, just building off of sort of that OpEx question, you talked also about reducing costs. Are there some cost savings to be done in the cost of goods sold side for the gross margin improvement going forward? Other than just straight shrinks, are there architectural things here that can be done?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are all kinds of ways to improve costs. You know, the -- how I start, holy cow. As I\u2019m trying to answer your question, a list of 2,000 things just popped up in my head. So the answer is yes.  Improving gross margins is not just my job or Marv\u2019s job. This is the job of 5,553 employees and anybody who is on our payroll needs to be figuring out how to improve our gross margins, and people who aren\u2019t on our payroll ought to figure out how to improve our gross margin.  So the answer is, Doug, it\u2019s an enormous issue and we are frustrated as hell that we got ourselves in this position. Some of it we can control, some of it we couldn\u2019t but we should have done the things and we could have done the things we could have controlled, and so we are going to go do it. And so the beautiful thing about a disruptive quarter like this, from a company\u2019s position perspective and the type of work that we are doing, nothing has changed, and our opportunity hasn\u2019t changed. But this is a wonderful wake-up call for all of us and it\u2019s a -- you know, no greater time to heighten the awareness of gross margin improvements at NVIDIA. \nDoug Freedman - American Technology Research: In recent analyst days, you\u2019ve put up some slides showing how increasing GPU and taking down the CPU actually improves the user experience. Have you seen any change from the system configuration side that that\u2019s starting to happen? Any way that we can track that or anything you can do to help us understand the marketplace?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, it\u2019s possible. If you take a look at our performance segment, I think the performance segment -- hey, guys, help me if -- I think I\u2019m right here, but our performance segment, the performance segment increased year-over-year by about 40%. So the performance segment is growing.  Now, this last quarter, the mid range PC market really declined and the mid range desktop PC market happens to be our low end GPU market. And that part of the marketplace really, really collapsed during the second quarter. But the high-end marketplace was healthy. There we had to adjust our ASPs but the high-end PC marketplace -- not the high-end PC marketplace, the high-end GPU marketplace, the performance GPU marketplace from $149 and above, is robust and it grew a lot year over year.  So I think -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to shifting, nor is it that important. The most important thing is that our initiative is really about helping people understand that there are a lot of different ways to design computers and a lot of different ways to improve your user experience, and that\u2019s really ultimately our focus, is to enhance user experience. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital. Please proceed.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: On the transition to -- I know this is not the only problem that you have but let\u2019s say by the end of your fiscal \u201909 year, from what I piece together, actually the whole company top to bottom on the GPU side would be on 55-nanometer. So the die shrink part of the problem should be behind you. And I was wondering about this testing problem that you have had in the last six months. Would that be behind you as well?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Testing problem?\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Well, I think you weren\u2019t able to test enough good chips and some of those chips sort of got thrown away. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh, that\u2019s improved a lot. The ops team is very focused on that, David, and I think that that has improved a great deal. In fact, I looked at the metrics just this morning and it\u2019s improved a lot quarter over quarter. So I think there is still a lot of work to do and that\u2019s one of the areas where gross margins can improve. We need to dramatically reduce the amount of scrapage that we have as a company and those are great opportunities for gross margin improvements that doesn\u2019t affect price and it doesn\u2019t affect our market position and only improves our earnings. And with respect to your first comment, hopefully by the end of the year, we should be top to bottom 55. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Can I follow-up with one quick one? I understand from various websites that the tape-out has already occurred for the 40-nanometer part that you have been designing out of your B foundries. I assume that means you will be going to production in the new fiscal year fairly early. Is that more or less correct?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we made the mistake of having a bad quarter -- let\u2019s not make the mistake of pre-announcing our products. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Okay. Marv -- \nMarvin D. Burkett: Yes?\nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you all for joining us this quarter and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2009, "date": "2008-05-09 01:48:08", "content": "Executives: Michael Hara - Investor Relations Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Marvin D.

On the call today for NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, NVIDIA's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marv Burkett, NVIDIA's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I would like to take care of some general administrative items. Your lines have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer segment of today\u2019s call. During this call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures about net income, diluted net income per share, and gross margin when talking about our results. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on the investor relations page of our website at www.nvidia.com. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or John Petty Research. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Please be aware that if you decide to ask a question, it will be included in both our live transmission as well as any future use of the recording. Also, shareholders can listen to a live webcast of today\u2019s call via the investor relations page of our website. The webcast will be available for replay until the company\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its second quarter fiscal 2009. During the course of this conference call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, including statements as to the importance of and uses for the GPU and CUDA, our financial outlook and projections, the impact, performance and availability of and demand for our products and technologies, the impact of PTL, our growth and strategies, and the future of computing. The company\u2019s actual results may differ materially from results discussed in any forward-looking statements.

Consistent with the requirements under Regulation FD, we will be providing public guidance directly in the conference call and will be unable to provide significantly more information in offline conversations or during the quarter. Therefore, questions around our financial expectations should be asked during this call. At the end of our remarks, there will be time for your questions. In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response, we will allow one follow-up question. I will now hand the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we reported revenue of $1.15 billion for our first quarter. Compared to last year, revenue grew 37% and GAAP net income increased 34%. Year over year, our GPU revenue grew 55%, MCP revenue grew 31%, PSB revenue grew 44%.  Our overall GPU units grew 42% while ASPs grew 10% year over year, a trend reflecting the growing importance of the GPU.  We gained share in virtually every graphics category year over year -- desktop GPU, notebook GPU, and notebook integrated graphics. For the performance segment, which is a reflection of technology leadership, we estimated our segment share is 90%.  Overall our graphics market share grew from 30% to 33% year over year. However, if we accounted for double attach, which happens when a PC has both integrated graphics and GPU, our market share is approximately 42%. Double attach happens because integrated graphics chipsets are often the same price as discrete chipsets. The market buys an integrated graphics motherboard but then turns it off when a GPU is added.  Our first quarter reflects the growing importance of GPUs as our computing experience becomes increasingly visually rich. Let me turn the call over to Marv to discuss our financial results. I will return in a moment to talk about how we will continue to lead the visual computing revolution and shape the computer industry.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. Today we\u2019ll be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is stock-based compensation and its tax effect.  As Jen-Hsun stated, revenue for the first quarter was $1.15 billion, which is up 37% year to year and down 4% quarter to quarter. Our revenue was in line with our expectations.  For the first quarter, GPU revenue, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory, grew 45% year to year but declined by 8% from the fourth quarter. The components of GPU had significant growth year to year. Desktop GPUs grew 44% year to year. Notebook grew 99% and memory declined 36%.  Quarter to quarter, both desktop and notebook declined by about 8% and memory was down 22%.  MCP grew 31% year to year and declined 4% quarter to quarter. The star for the first quarter was the professional solutions business, which includes workstation products. It grew 44% year to year and 21% quarter to quarter. The consumer business declined by 24% quarter to quarter and 37% year to year.  All in all, most of the revenue was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. ASPs held relatively flat quarter to quarter.  Gross margin was disappointing. We didn\u2019t manage our product transitions as well as we would have liked and this resulted in a decline in gross margin to 44.6%. We can do better. The issues in gross margin were focused primarily on product transition issues in the GPU business. Therefore, margin for the GPU business segment declined by almost two full percentage points quarter to quarter. Again, it was not an ASP issues, as ASPs held relatively flat. We had hoped and expected to make progress in improving the yields for the new products. This did not happen.  Margin in the professional solutions business remained very good. Margin in MCP were down because of the movement to the integrated chipsets, but that was expected.  GAAP operating expenses were $312 million, which is up 8.6% quarter to quarter and in line with our expectations. Most of the increase was in R&D as we absorbed several acquisitions that we made recently. Headcount grew by 373 during the quarter and our ending headcount was 5,358. Year to year the headcount is up by 1,284.  Depreciation in the quarter was $41.4 million, up by around $4.5 million from the previous quarter. Capital expenditures were $202.2 million, which included a purchase of property in Santa Clara for approximately $150 million. Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the quarter.  Stock-based compensation was $42 million for the quarter, up from $34 million in Q4, as we had stock options issued for the new hires and the semi-annual grants, and the volatility portion of the binomial calculation has increased based on what is happening in the stock market.  Other income dropped by $7 million quarter to quarter. This was a combination of several factors. The impact of the continuing weakness of the dollar on our foreign currency denominated liabilities resulted in foreign exchange losses of approximately $4 million in the quarter. Also, the lower cash balance and the lower interest rates drove down the interest income.  As we expected, the tax rate was 17% for the quarter. The lack of a renewal of the R&D tax credit will cause our tax rate to remain at this level until the renewal is passed. When it is passed, we would expect the tax rate to drop to the 13% to 14% level.  The end result was that GAAP EPS was $0.30 per share and non-GAAP was $0.36 per share.  On the balance sheet, ending cash was $1.62 billion. We completed three acquisitions for cash during the quarter, as well as paying the $150 million for the property and $124 million for stock repurchases. None of our marketable securities required any valuation adjustments.  Our accounts receivable ended at $652 million, down $15 million from the prior quarter and DSO was 51 days, up from 50 days in the fourth quarter. There are no issues of delinquent receivables.  Inventories were $420 million, up $62 million from Q4, as we built inventory of new products, both announced and unannounced. The older inventory declined as we had expected. The result is that day sales in inventory ended the quarter at 60 days, which is more than the last two quarters DSI of less than 50 days. These inventory levels are in line with our DSI targets.  Net property plant and equipment increased by $162 million, which included $150 million for the purchase, for the property purchase that I mentioned earlier.  Both accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased for the quarter and the total decrease was $91 million.  On the outlook, Q2\u2019s revenue was historically the most difficult to forecast. In the past, we\u2019ve been surprised both favorably, as in last year, and unfavorably, as in five years ago. Having said that, we have no reason to believe that Q2 will be anything other than seasonal. Seasonal to us means a decline of 5% plus or minus.  As I stated previously, we were disappointed in our gross margin for Q1 and we intend to correct some of the issues. Therefore, I would expect the gross margin will increase and while the exact magnitude may be difficult to predict, something in the 100 basis point range is not unreasonable.  Operating expenses stepped up in Q1 as a consequence of the acquisitions, new hires, and other reasons. As I\u2019ve said before, we intend to moderate any increases going forward. Therefore, operating expenses for Q2 should be flat to very slightly up. We will still be hiring but the rate will moderate and other expenses will decrease. The results should be flat to slightly up.  Other income should recover in Q2 unless the dollar continues to weaken. If it is stable, other income will be up in Q2. The tax rate should stay at 17% until the R&D tax credit is renewed. I don\u2019t expect that to happen in Q2.  With that, I will turn it back over to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Marv. The transition from G80 to G92 was challenging and dragged our margins. Every few generations, because of how our new products are aligned with process nodes, a new GPU is both faster and cheaper. As a result, it is difficult to move the stack down to layer the new GPU on top of the stack. This was the case in the G80 to G92 transition. G92 was both lower cost and higher performance than G80, so therefore repositioning G80 while ramping G92 aggressively forced us to sell out G80s at lower margins.  Going forward, although we still have some G80 inventory to work through, we believe we are in an excellent competitive position. We are also launching new exciting products in Q2 and the move across the board to 55-nanometer is expected to help margins. At our analyst day in April, I outlined NVIDIA's basic strategies -- one, focus on visual computing and be the unambiguous world leader; two, continue to create GPU software or system architecture innovations that deliver the wonderful user experiences that we are famous for; and three, make the GPU evermore programmable and more useful for general purpose computing.  Our strategy is driving growth in several ways. Our innovations are growing TAM and driving share in the visual computing centric markets like gaming PCs and workstations. We are also seeing increasing ASPs as more of the total system spend is shifting to the GPU. We are seeing this trend all over the world. We call this the optimized PC design movement, where OEMs are rebalancing the system spend to optimize performance for applications that are increasingly visual.  As GPUs become more programmable and general purpose and are now used to enhance photo and video processing, we are starting to see growth from broad adoption of GPUs in mainstream consumer PCs. Consumers now use their PCs to create and enjoy their home movies and photos. They use their PCs to watch high-definition movies, gather with friends and hang out in an online virtual world, or enjoy some crazy videos on YouTube.  And as the home base of your iPod, many are using the PC to convert movies into a format that can be played on their iPods. This is called transcoding.  We call this new generation of consumer PCs lifestyle PCs. This segment of the PC market is one of the fastest growing, as we can see by the success of Apple and Adobe. This new PC segment is a growth segment for GPUs. The GPU\u2019s ability to manipulate images, video, and graphics dramatically enhances the computing experience and as we recently demonstrated at our analyst day, the GPU can speed up transcoding, one of the most processor intensive applications, by nearly 20 times.  The marketplace is clearly bifurcating into generic PCs and those that are built for specific needs of the users. PC manufacturers worldwide are no longer designing PCs based simply on the speeds and feeds, but with the total user experience in mind.  As for large segments of the marketplace like CAD workstations, gaming PCs, video editing, video/photo editing workstations for creative professionals, media centers, and now lifestyle PCs, the visual experience is front and center and cannot be compromised.  Globally we see the movement towards usage optimized PC design taking hold and increasing momentum. Here are some quotes from the press around the world: here in the United States, Popular Science: \u201cbut in some cases the GPU makes a big difference. 3D video games are a given but intensive graphics are creeping into many other applications.\u201d Computer Resellers News in India: \u201cAre graphics chips the better CPUs? More and more experts support this thesis. Many system builders supposedly recognize the trend already and would assembly PCs with better GPUs because the CPU is losing its importance while the meaning of the GPU is increasing continuously.\u201d [Vlasadenta], Poland: \u201cWhen creating optimal PC set, it is totally pointless to equip your computer with an expensive CPU and add integrated or slow graphics solutions. You should do the other way around -- install expensive dual-core CPU -- inexpensive dual-core CPU and support it with more expensive GPU.\u201d [Lorjenitor Individual] -- my daughter should be happy about me speaking French -- France: \u201cIt is true that since the PC has existed, only the processors seemed to be important, to the point of often giving its name to the computer. But we are now in the era of the visual PC. All applications starting with Windows Vista and the Arrow interface exploit an intensive widening of graphics capabilities to the machines no longer using the CPU but the GPU.\u201d The growth of GPUs reflect these market dynamics as the new conventional wisdom. As I mentioned earlier, our desktop and notebook GPU units grew 42% year over year and our GPU ASPs increased 10% from a year ago.  In additional to visual computing driving our GPU growth, we have a new growth driver with the invention of CUDA. It is important to understand that CUDA is not in just any GPU. CUDA is a C programmable general purpose computing mode available only in our GPUs, from GeForce 8 and beyond.  In the CUDA mode, our GPUs transform and reconfigure its shader processors into a many core parallel computing processor. For example the GeForce 9800GT has 128 processor cores. CUDA enables a new parallel computing model that the industry calls heterogeneous multi-core computing, where the vastly different architectures of the CPU and GPU are used in a collaborative way to achieve huge speed-ups in computing. CUDA has raised the attention of programmers and researchers all over the world. Since its launch, over 60,000 downloads of the compiler, over 10,000 per month, have been downloaded by software developers, scientists, students, game developers and researchers around the world that have started programming with CUDA.  We recently released a beta version of CUDA 2.0 and for the Mac. We are constantly seeing reports of astounding application speed-ups. We are routinely seeing 20 to 200 times speed-up over multi-core CPU alone. Chevron has shown excellent performance using GPUs for computing in oil and gas exploration. Jack Collins, from the National Cancer Instituted, recently reported excellent results on AutoDock, a key application in cancer drug discovery.  [Gouda] and [Navcentric] announced EDA tools using GPU for computing optical proximity correction, or OPC, and [inaudible] for design.  CEA, the French Atomic Energy Authority, and Bull released news of a design win in super computing using NVIDIA GPUs.  Last week, we announced our sponsorship of Stanford University's new Pervasive Parallelism Lab, PPL. The PPL will develop new techniques, tools, and training materials to allow software engineers to harness the parallelism of the heterogeneous multi-core computing. Stanford now joins the growing list of prestigious research programs, including the universal parallel computing research center, UPCRC, both at Berkeley and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, each designed to accelerate developments in mainstream parallel computing.  We see computer scientists all over the world jumping into heterogeneous multi-core computing research.  As the world\u2019s leading supplier of GPUs, we are in truly exciting times. The new sensibility of OEMs optimizing PCs for visually rich applications is driving GPU adoption and spend. And with CUDA, we have transformed our GPU into a general purpose parallel processor at precisely the time when the CPU performance improvement is slowing and the industry is moving full-force to parallel computing.  We believe the GPU will be the most important process of this new era and will be a major driving force of visual computing and parallel computing revolution.  We are happy to take your questions now. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company.\nQuinn Bolton - Needham & Company: Just wondering on the gross margin, it sounds like it\u2019s just some transitional issues but you mentioned some new products that you built up in inventory and as you look forward into July and future quarters, can you talk about as you roll out these new products, is the architecture similar, different -- what can we be expecting about gross margin with some of these new products that you are building up in inventory?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re not ready to announce the new products yet but the gross margins of the new products are better than the gross margins of existing products. \nQuinn Bolton - Needham & Company: Okay, so think about it as more transitions as you introduce the new products, they tend to carry the higher gross -- higher than corporate gross margins?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. \nQuinn Bolton - Needham & Company: Okay, great. And then as you look into the second quarter, can you just talk about linearity of orders that you\u2019ve seen over the past month or two that gives you sort of the sense that Q2 looks seasonal at this point?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m trying to figure out -- we haven\u2019t seen Q2 yet. We are still going through Q2 and Q2 has a -- is a seasonal quarter for the industry on the one hand; on the other hand, this is also the quarter that we sometimes, as the last several years, we have many times announced new products during Q2 as we go into the back to school season. And so you know the back to school season starts I guess around late May and June and ramps pretty hard into July. And our fiscal quarter ends at the end of July and so it includes July. And so that tends to balance each other so it\u2019s kind of hard to exactly tell how Q2 will turn out because it just happens to be a seasonal quarter but we have the benefit of new products and we have the benefit of back to school, typically. And so we\u2019ll report on Q2 when we\u2019re done with it. \nQuinn Bolton - Needham & Company: Okay, and then just lastly, any comments on how you feel inventory in the channel is, especially on some of the older products ahead of these product transitions you just mentioned? Do you feel pretty comfortable with where inventory is?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The products that we are going to announce in Q2, there are no products -- we are done with our product transitions in Q1 and so the products in Q2 will layer into the existing product line. \nQuinn Bolton - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda from Deutsche Bank Securities.\nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. A question for either Jen-Hsun or Marv; when do you expect significant revenues from your TESLA product and the application processor product?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say significant I guess later this year but those design wins tend to be a lot longer. TESLA because they go into servers and super-computers and scientific computing applications, or [design] workstations. So they tend to have a longer design cycle. We are seeing a lot of enthusiasm out there but it just takes a little longer.  And as you know, application processors definitely take longer. Their design cycles are consistent with the design of the device itself and so we are really enthusiastic about both of them and they\u2019ve been wonderful investments for us, and I think they are going to pay off wonderfully. So we just have to wait until the end of the year. \nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. One other question about the CUDA platform -- could you help us understand what portion of the computing market, if you include both PC as well as high-performance computing, is open to the heterogeneous computing model that you are recommending and what -- maybe it\u2019s difficult to give an exact number but how should we think about how big that market can be?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that\u2019s a good question. I happen to think that within the next five to 10 years, no longer than 10 years and probably around five years, the heterogeneous multi-core computing will be the way of computing for all computers, whether it is video processing or image processing or whether it\u2019s in the area of games obviously for graphics, but more importantly in the future for simulation, physics simulation, artificial intelligence simulation. You\u2019ve been hearing about how the expense of creating content continues to go up and the reason for that is because these worlds are more and more expansive and it\u2019s hard for artists to create the entire world. And so just like movies, they use -- movies uses a simulator for cloth simulation, otherwise they would have to animate all of the cloth, all of the clothes that the actors wear, or hair simulation or in large crowds, they use crowd simulators, which is basically a form of artificial intelligence.  And so we are going to see more and more simulations as a way of creating content in online games, in virtual worlds, in videogames, and of course in the area of mainstream users -- you know, it\u2019s -- you know that videogames is really a mainstream application anymore but in the area of photos and videos, you are going to see a lot of computational techniques starting later this year from some very important applications. And so I ought not pre-announce some of their exciting products but consumer applications, lifestyle applications are going to start showing, using GPUs in some really, really exciting ways.  So I think heterogeneous computing is the future. I mean, it is as obvious as using the right tool to do the right job and there is no reason why heterogeneous computing can\u2019t be available to everybody. You know, we\u2019ve shipped 60 million CUDA GPUs already and we are on track to ship 100 million, 150 million GPUs a year and in a couple, two, three years, that\u2019s several hundred million PCs will have heterogeneous computing in it. So I think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that heterogeneous computing is here. The question now is what are the exciting applications that are going to come.  And just one more comment -- in the last 20 years that I\u2019ve been in the computer industry, the CPU or the computer has improved in performance a staggering 1,000 times. It\u2019s a staggering 1,000 times. And that\u2019s clearly one of the most aggressive improvements in performance of any technology or anything that humanity has ever seen.  And yet CUDA, in the hands of all these 60,000 software engineers around the world, and it\u2019s easy for you to find applications and reports of CUDA applications written, people are seeing 20, 50, 100, 200, 300 times speed-up. In just one year, we\u2019ve helped the computer improve its performance by 100 times. That kind of a step-up and that kind of a discontinuity in computing performance has just never happened. And so that\u2019s the reason why Stanford and Berkeley and UIUC and just about every supercomputing center on the planet and scientists all over the world and software engineers in all the major software companies that you and I both know are all looking into heterogeneous multi-core computing.  I think this is clearly the future. \nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: Last question, Jen-Hsun; may be a little difficult to answer in a public forum but in the past you haven\u2019t been too shy, so your best friends in Santa Clara, have any of their actions, public talk, et cetera, affected either pricing or any success or future potential of the chipset business? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think any dialog around GPUs is welcome for me. I would love to have Good Morning America cover GPUs. If any city -- Santa Clara, Toronto, Austin -- any city who would like to have a dialog around the importance of heterogeneous computing, GPUs and what we could do as an industry to advance computing is a welcome conversation. So I think all of that conversation around GPUs and graphics is all good for us. I welcome all of it. \nArnab Chanda - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley - Piper Jaffray : I have a couple of questions relating to balance sheet items. Are there any troubles in production lead times still out there? And your inventory turns are still above the historical norm of five to six and I\u2019m just curious whether we might see a continued rise in the NVIDIA held inventory. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Our day sales in inventory are 60 and that\u2019s where I\u2019d hope to get it because then it\u2019s down at 50 or below, that\u2019s too little inventory. Once you have it at 60, the real issue is what is in the inventory? Is it old stuff that is moving slowly or is it new stuff where you don\u2019t have enough of it? And I would say at this stage that I am very comfortable with the inventory, both the profile and the amount of it. Are we going to build inventory? Yeah, I think we\u2019ll build inventory as we go into Q3 and Q4 and with the expectation that revenue usually increases significantly in Q3 and Q4, so I wouldn\u2019t have any trouble at all with building inventory in Q2, providing it\u2019s the right inventory. \nGary Mobley - Piper Jaffray : Okay, and production lead times? Are there any issues still there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re still growing as a company so production lead times continue to be a challenge for us but you know, our fab partners are working hard for us and they are doing their best for us. But you heard me say that our GPUs, and GPUs, just so you know, are the most complex -- recognized now the most complex processors the world makes and we ship 100 million a year and so it may look easy but it is the largest pieces of silicon that anybody makes, period.  And so when I said that we grew our GPU units 50% year over year -- \nMichael Hara: 42. \nJen-Hsun Huang: 42% year over year, that\u2019s a very large number. I know that none of the foundries grew 42% year over year and I know that the PC industry didn\u2019t grow 42% year over year, and so you can just imagine our wafer starts. And so our fab partners are really working hard for us. I would like -- I would love to grow another 50% year over year and there is certainly every opportunity for us to do that, and our fab partners just have to -- you know, they have to all pitch in and help us get there. \nGary Mobley - Piper Jaffray : Lastly, could you provide some comment on the consumer business, sort of the ebbs and flows going on there with the different components? Is that revenue and might we see some stabilization in this business going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think stabilization in consumer businesses, that\u2019s probably a -- what do they call it, an oxymoron? Jumbo shrimp? You know, that\u2019s the nature of the consumer business and the thing that I do know is this -- that PS3s are doing great. The Blu-Ray/HD war is over. The PS3 is benefiting from both second generation titles. They are benefiting from first party titles that are coming out in the near future. That\u2019s going to be pretty hot and they have Blu-Ray. And if you don\u2019t know this, you should go get one. It\u2019s pretty affordable. PS3 is the world\u2019s best Blu-Ray player, period, flat out. It\u2019s just a fabulous Blu-Ray player.  So I think PS3s are going to do great. They are in the process of transitioning to a new process node and so we are looking forward to how they ramp into the holiday season. \nGary Mobley - Piper Jaffray : Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Could you maybe within the desktop GPU segment comment on your expectations for Q2 in terms of pricing, and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any incremental pricing actions by some of your competitors there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It\u2019s hard to exactly predict what happens in the short-term, but I know what the general trends are. The general trends are the GPU is benefiting from an industry-wide recognition that visual computing is important. The GPU is doing more and more things because it is more and more programmable, and with CUDA, we\u2019ve made the GPU a completely general purpose parallel processor. And so these things will cause it to be adopted more and therefore that will increase units. It will increase its TAM, you know, places that you would have never thought a GPU would go would include a GPU. And it would also increase its ASP because it is more and more useful.  And so we are seeing all of those mega-trends, and so I think that with respect to Q2, we know we are announcing new products and so that\u2019s always helpful but I can\u2019t control what the competition does. \nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly on the R&D spending, Mark, do you expect that you can hold that to roughly flattish levels from Q2 and then through the rest of the year, or do you expect that would tick up a little bit as we move to the back half?\nMarvin D. Burkett: I think if we continue to hire, it\u2019s going to tick up in the back half. I mean, we have our very strong focus on trying to hold it as flat as possible in Q2. I think at the analyst day I said the same thing. So our focus now is holding it flat for Q2. We\u2019ll see how successful we are. I would think it will tick up slightly. As I said before, I think we\u2019ll moderate the growth throughout the rest of the year. \nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAnalyst for Glen Yeung - Citigroup : This is Peter [Kirazaris] for Glen Yeung. In the guidance for gross margin being up 100 basis points next quarter, can you give me some sense of how much of that is your thinking on the improvement from manufacturing and how much of it would be coming from product mix?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, you know, 100 basis points should be -- we can do a lot better in terms of the manufacturing side, so I think that we don\u2019t need significant uplift in other areas in order to achieve the 100 basis point increase. What we do need is really superb execution internally and we are going to have to work very hard for that to happen. \nAnalyst for Glen Yeung - Citigroup : All right, so the 100 is really driven by -- it\u2019s correct for me to say it\u2019s driven primarily by the improvement in manufacturing, any mix would be upside to that, is that correct?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Yeah, probably. We\u2019ll see. \nAnalyst for Glen Yeung - Citigroup : And SG&A, should I assume that more closely tracks revenue? You\u2019ve kind of given us some detail around R&D spend but should I be thinking that SG&A then next quarter could be down a bit with the revenue and then it comes up in the second half of the year?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Our OpEx is not closely tied to revenue. It is closely tied to the number of people we have and projects we have going on. So if revenue goes up or declines, our SG&A doesn\u2019t track right along with it. So no, I think they are independent movements, Peter. \nAnalyst for Glen Yeung - Citigroup : All right, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayyib Shah from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Jen-Hsun, you are guiding to revenues in line with historical seasonality for the PC space. With the 9000 series ramping, it puts you in a strong competitive position in the desktop space. Do you expect to gain some share in the back-to-school season and if so, shouldn\u2019t you be guiding above historical seasonality?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Did I mention the -- we\u2019ve got to treat Q2 with respect. I think you are right that we have a very strong, a very good competitive position. We have fabulous products top to bottom and we are also announcing several new initiatives that you guys heard about at the analyst day.  One of the things is the modern benchmark is out. We\u2019ve been using -- the benchmark that the industry has been using has been around since 2006 and in graphics years, that\u2019s a long time, and so the new benchmark is out. It\u2019s called 3D MarkVantage and it\u2019s a modern benchmark and because its -- our GPUs, our modern GPUs are designed for modern applications. You would think that our position on 3D MarkVantage should be extraordinary and it is. So that\u2019s one thing and that\u2019s in the process of rolling out. The market doesn\u2019t really know it yet and I think you could see some early websites, go see some -- and you might just be able to Google it and find some reviews and you\u2019ll see that the reviews are really fabulous with GeForce 8 and GeForce 9, so that\u2019s one.  The second thing is we are going to announce this quarter probably the highest volume parallel computing application or software in the world and that\u2019s physics processing. It\u2019s used in almost every modern game and it is one of the most computational intensive things that you can do in a game and it now runs on CUDA on GeForce GPUs.  And then we are going to add on top of that -- hopefully we\u2019ll go into production later on in the quarter -- transcoding. It is probably the killer app today with the number of iPods that are being sold and iPhones that are being sold. People are downloading a lot of videos onto their portable media players and the transcoding of videos take forever. You have to start it up at night and give up your PC and go to bed and hope that it\u2019s done before you wake up.  And so we are going to accelerate the transcoding of movies to what is called super real-time -- it\u2019s much, much faster than it takes for you to watch is, and so I think transcoding is just going to -- people are going to be nuts over the work that we are doing in this area.  So not only are we -- do we have a fabulous position with our GPU lineup but we are adding three major things to it this quarter and I think that can\u2019t but help. But having said all that, I think we\u2019ve got to show Q2 its due respect. \nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Okay, and then the share shift in the notebook space, is that going to play out in the July quarter and then return the company to the normal seasonal trend in the October quarter, or are we likely to see a drag from notebook share shift in the October quarter as well?\nMarvin D. Burkett: It will certainly play out in Q2. You\u2019ll see that share shift start to take place in Q2. There will be a little bit of drag in Q3 but the major portion of it is in Q2. \nJen-Hsun Huang: But I think it\u2019s all-important to keep it all in perspective. I think first of all, the notebook GPU business is a lot smaller than the desktop GPU business and the market share that we lost is mostly in the entry level segment and so it\u2019s a small percentage of a small percentage, and so I -- I\u2019d just put it in perspective. I think in the final analysis, we\u2019d like to have all the business in the world but sometimes the profitability doesn\u2019t suggest it would be the most prudent thing to do. And so we\u2019ve -- we\u2019re going to keep fighting for our share but I\u2019d urge you to keep that in perspective. \nTayyib Shah - Longbow Research: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. Marv, I\u2019m just a little surprised at the commentary on the margin guidance just with respect to the entire benefit being from manufacturing. I guess if I look at your Q1, you did have some favorable mix in the sense that workstation being up 21%. That\u2019s a 70% gross margin business, and then your memory was down 20%, yet you were kind of light on margins, as you\u2019ve alluded to. So as we move into July, is there going to be another element that is going to be really helping the margin? Because I can\u2019t imagine that we are going to have the same favorable mix on those two product segments carrying into July. And then, as we kind of -- is it just a matter of getting -- you know, you\u2019ve gotten through the excess inventory in the GeForce 8X family and now you are going to have new products as well ramping, so the GPU margin should also improve on top of that manufacturing improvement? Any color there would be helpful.\nMarvin D. Burkett: Jen-Hsun outlined this -- the G80 to G92 transition has been difficult for us and it has certainly impacted the GPU margins. As I mentioned, the overall GPU margins were down 2 percentage points quarter to quarter. Now, that\u2019s a combination of both of those factors but what I was referring to is that you are going to get the benefit of one of those because you don\u2019t have to repeat them. The other one of the manufacturing improvements that we have to do is going to drive the other portion of it. So yeah, I anticipate that we won\u2019t get the lift that we got from the PSB business unit in Q1 and we won\u2019t get perhaps the lift in some other areas. But even taking that into consideration, we still believe that 100 basis points is reasonable. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think just to help amplify that and Marv and I have both talked about it but let me just add a fine point to it -- typically when you introduce a new product, it\u2019s either more expensive but it\u2019s much higher performance, or another way of saying it\u2019s much higher performance but it typically is higher cost. Or you introduce a product that goes into the mid-range or the entry segment and it is lower performance but it is definitely lower cost.  So those are the typical product transitions. I mean, typical as in out of every nine product transitions, out of every 10 transitions, nine will be that way. But every so often, the moon and the stars and everything kind of align and you get a situation like the G80 to G92 where G92 is both faster and cheaper. And it\u2019s a combination of both process improvement and also kind of the midlife kicker syndrome, in the sense that G80 was the first implementation of our CUDA architecture, and so G92 had the benefit of learning from big brother and we fixed a lot of the architectural things that we left on the table. And so G92 has that added kicker.  So when you are presented with a situation where something is cheaper and it is much more higher performance, it is really tough to manage through the transition. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: And I guess how much of what occurred with the G92, I mean, was this more of a function -- you know, we had obviously some manufacturing constraints in late fiscal 2008. I mean, were the forecasts just overly optimistic or was there maybe an air pocket of soft demand as we kind of went through April -- any comments there, please?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, we were in allocation on G80 and -- holy cow, until the day we had a bunch of inventory to sell at a lower margin, so it\u2019s -- part of it is the cycle times aggravate that. Part of it is seasonality and a large part of it is G92. G92 was such a good product, and you probably remember the reviews. I mean, G92 when it came out, the reviews were this is the perfect product because it was affordable and it was so high performance.  And so it\u2019s tough for G80 to compete against that and especially when the manufacturing was running full steam right when G92 came out. It\u2019s just hard to manage those kind of transitions. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: And last thing, Jen-Hsun, just with respect to these low-end notebooks that are coming into the market, if you kind of talk to the channel they are somewhat concerned about potentially desktop cannibalization accelerating this year. Intel has talked about actually their crossover occurring this year as opposed to next year. What does that mean for the GPU industry and how -- is that even a threat at all or do you feel comfortable with what you are doing with the hybrid graphics technology that over time, your attach rate, the GPU attach rate in notebooks will continue to increase and this really isn\u2019t that much of a threat as some of the channel is making out to be with their own business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, the crossover, be sure to understand what it actually says. As far as all the data shows, and certainly we did sell 40%-plus more GPUs this year than last, so they are going somewhere. What the data shows is that desktop PC growth is small but notebook PC growth is fast. And most notebook PC growth is mostly an extremely low cost notebook growth.  And so what it basically tells me, and my family is probably similar as other families, where people buy one or two desktop PCs but everybody has their own laptop. And so I think that increasingly, more and more families are that way, and so we are seeing that basic trend, that for every desktop PC, you might see one plus notebooks and that those notebooks will tend to be for personal use.  But I think the mega-trend though that we are seeing -- that is one trend that you are recognizing, and that\u2019s the notebooks, there are just more and more notebooks sold, but the second thing that you are noticing is that in the markets that we serve, there increasingly increased ASP and increased adoption of GPUs. We are not in the vast majority of the world\u2019s PCs yet. We still have a pretty large TAM to grow into  And so within that TAM, I expect that ASPs of GPUs will continue to grow as the usefulness of GPUs continue to grow and as people recognize that their PCs are more visual than ever, they will use more GPUs.  So I think the growth opportunity is still pretty healthy out there. \nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple on inventory -- did you guys write down inventory in Q1?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, we always write down inventory but -- \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Beyond normal?\nMarvin D. Burkett: No. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay, and then for --\nMarvin D. Burkett: It was normal. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay, thank you. And on the channel inventories, can you describe how the inventory that your OEM and channel partners are looking right now -- is it normal, a little higher than normal and maybe give some color on trends there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It\u2019s higher than normal but I think that during this time of the year, it tends to be higher than normal and it\u2019s sort of the opposite of saying -- corollary of saying seasonality. But don\u2019t forget that this is also the time right before back-to-school season, so as you\u2019ll recall last year about this time, inventory grew in the channel and then shortly after that, back-to-school ramps up and it also went into June and July and back-to-school and before you know it, it\u2019s fall. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Right, so higher than last quarter but not higher than what you would normally expect this time of year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t think so. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Okay and then as far as the guidance for Q2, the down 5% -- if I\u2019m reading my notes correctly, it looks like you\u2019ve guided over the last three years for a flattish to slightly up for Q2. Is the visibility you have now less than normal? Are you trying to predict what\u2019s going on in notebook? What\u2019s making this year a little bit different from the last several years?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, notebook is -- the share loss we\u2019ve talked about in notebooks doesn\u2019t represent 5% of our top line, and so -- as I\u2019ve already explained.  I don\u2019t think there is -- I feel like I\u2019m the only person that is maybe watching CNBC but there is no harm in a little caution into this Q2. \nMarvin D. Burkett: We\u2019re just nervous. It\u2019s the stock market. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I feel like maybe I just landed on another planet, but we have a great product position. We have a great product position and we have really exciting products coming out and there\u2019s two major trends that are happening that\u2019s going to drive GPU growth. One of them is visual computing and the other one is parallel computing. They are not related. They are completely different things that are happening and we find ourselves at the epicenter of both.  And so I\u2019m excited about our growth prospects, but Q2 is Q2 and we ought to just -- if we come out the other end of it and surprised ourselves, so be it. But a little conservatism going into it is not a terrible thing.  \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan Securities: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heidi Poon from Thomas Weisel Partners. Please go ahead. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners : I\u2019m wondering if you could give us an update about the motherboard GPU business in terms of where you see pricing going to in the second half. And also, you announced a VIA platform on the analyst day, so could you give us an update on the design activities?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let\u2019s see -- Marv, you already mentioned about MCP business, where we grew MCP business over 30% year over year. \nMarvin D. Burkett: And it went down 4% quarter to quarter. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t know of any major reasons why the MCP business would change in terms of its characteristics, and let me tell you why. I think the DX10 -- in order for you to be Vista Premium certified by Microsoft, you have to have DX10 capability I think it\u2019s by August or something like that, either July or August. And so DX10 -- and the second thing is that the new benchmark is out. It is the benchmark that the entire PC industry, the entire supply chain uses to determine the worthiness of the product. And so you need to have DX10 to have any meaningful capability on that benchmark, and so you have to put DX10 onto every GPU.  My sense is that our leadership in DX10 is going to be pretty substantial and so I -- we expect to bring that on to the motherboard in the near future and so we are excited about that. I don\u2019t anticipate anything except that graphics will be harder and harder to do, and our separation relative to the rest of the industry in terms of graphics leadership, as you\u2019ve been tracking and others have been tracking is diverging, or our lead is increasing, the rate of our lead increase is increasing, I think. And so I\u2019m enthusiastic about the work that we are doing there.  The VIA platform, we are still in the design and so it\u2019s a little bit too early to make any significant announcements. We are not planning to have production until spring of next year. I think it highlights that the VIA processor is very good and it is -- and it runs Vista Premium. It tells you that if you want a Vista Premium platform, a processor less than $20 certainly and soon, in another year or so, less than $10, with a sufficient GPU will give you a great experience on Vista Premium. And so that tells you something about the future of computing. This is just the first signs of it, that visual computing and computing can be done quite nicely in even very cost effective solutions. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners : Great, and lastly just a little bit more on mobile -- when you talk about having more substantial revenue in mobile by the end of the year, is that mostly related to the portable navigation device platform, or one that you discussed at the analyst day or are there more things to explain?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have some interesting announcements that we\u2019d like to make and give me an opportunity to make those announcements properly, so just watch this spot. I think mobile computing, and you\u2019ve seen the demonstrations of APX2500. I mean, everybody I\u2019ve shown it to, everybody who has seen it is just amazed at what capability you could put into a chip, a full computer that can fit on a chip that is smaller than the size of a dime. The entire computer, including the CPU and the GPU and the video encoder and decoder and high definition video and -- the whole computer can fit on a surface smaller than a dime and draw [inaudible]. So imagine what you could build with something like that and give us an opportunity announce it properly and it will get you excited about it. \nHeidi Poon - Thomas Weisel Partners : Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. A question for you, Marv; if I look at PSB, how much of the revenue this quarter was already TESLA that was recognized for the quarter?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, first of all the PSB revenue does not include TESLA. \nUche Orji - UBS: Okay, the second question, if I may just follow-up on that, if I look at PSB, one would think that given all the issues associated with financial service fees and upsizing, that that may affect that revenue, but obviously that hasn\u2019t. Can you just talk me through a little bit more what is driving the resilience of this business? Obviously this has been a great business for you, both top line and margins.  And also on the competitive front, are you seeing anything, given that AMD talked about reviving or driving Fire GL of its brand? I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that significant, but if you can just say anything on the competitive front, Jen-Hsun, that would be helpful. Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: At the highest level, the most important thing to recognize is that in every single industry, they are going digital. So where people used to use drafting boards and paper and pencil, they are doing digital, whether you are making comic books or designing buildings in China or designing the next airplane or car or whatever it is, everything is going digital. And so I think that that\u2019s a perfectly conventional wisdom and observation.  And as more and more of the -- but the pipeline can go digital because technology affords it to. We have to make the technology good enough so that you could do more things in digital. Let me give you one example.  We have to create amazing technologies in order to replace clay modeling of cars, because it has to be so realistic that you no longer have to build the entire model. That saves millions of dollars, it cuts an enormous amount of time off the design cycle for these car designers, but it requires an enormous amount of technology. And so those kind of -- whenever we reach those plateaus with technologies like Quadro Plex or some of the work that we are doing with our Scene Graph work, a lot of it has to do with software and multi-GPU scaling and just -- they are all systems or system architecture or software solutions. When we can reach these new plateaus, all of a sudden we convert an entire pipeline, work pipeline that an industry has into digital and that increases the TAM of workstations.  I think we are still very well into the early days of it and the reason for that is because what all of these companies want to do, they want to visualize, they want to design, they want to simulate -- you know, to simulate the dropping of a cup or a toaster or a cell phone, simulate the electromagnetic emissions of a cell phone. Simulate a car crashing and doing all of that from the comforts of an engineer\u2019s desk and not have to share a super-computer with people.  You know, styling, showrooms -- we\u2019re starting to see Quadro showing up in showrooms so you can pick your own color and choose your car. This is a new application. I have no idea how many showrooms are all over the world but every car company wants to do this now, put digital displays into showrooms. And they are power-walls -- enormous, enormous amounts of technology.  And I\u2019ve just talked about the car industry. And then further, they want to do inventory management. They want to do training, so that the mechanic can have interactive displays of the manuals instead of out-of-date prints.  There\u2019s so many different ways that visual computing can still transform the industrial workflow, and so we are really just seeing the beginning of it.  And then once you are done transforming the workflow, then you have to duplicate it. Don\u2019t forget outsourcing. Whenever you -- if a German company, auto company has a manufacturing plant in Asia and then they put one in India, guess what? They\u2019ve got to install the same workflow in those two countries. You could make the data virtual but you can\u2019t make a computer virtual, yet. And so there is still that globalization factor.  And so there is quite a bit of growth yet I think in PSB and I am enthusiastic about our position within it.  With respect to Fire GL, our workstation business is not called a GPU business, as you probably noticed. You called it PSB. It\u2019s a solutions business and a solutions business entails a lot more than building a chip. It\u2019s about understanding the processor, having an extraordinarily deep understanding of the software and the workflow and the pipeline, having experts all over our company and all over the world for our company who are assisting these designers work through their design pipelines or their design problems. So it\u2019s a -- and our entire ecosystem of partners where Quadro certification and being Quadro compatible is now the way people talk -- I want Quadro compatible workstations or my software is Quadro compatible, or this workflow is Quadro compatible.  And so these kind of investments took us 10 years to get here and it is just not about a graphics chip. It\u2019s not about an adding card and it\u2019s not about how big your frame buffer is. All of that just shows that people don\u2019t understand how these designers think. \nUche Orji - UBS: That\u2019s helpful, Jen-Hsun. I mean, it\u2019s amazing [this business can continue to apply] and [inaudible] stronger than equal. In terms of your ability to allocate capacity to keep driving this business, do you think there\u2019s any constraint in the future that, from a capacity standpoint, that could become an issue? Especially if you had to balance this against your G92 series that\u2019s ramping as well. So are there any capacity constraint issues to think about for the near term?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m not sure I understood the question. \nMichael Hara: Capacity constraint to the PSB business, is that what you are asking?\nUche Orji - UBS: I\u2019m asking because given the strength of the underlying growth in this business, are there -- because I remember a couple of quarters ago where you had to make some decisions in terms of allocating resources through capacity to PSB and that bounced back. If I look forward in the future, do you think that there is enough foundry capacity to keep driving the underlying growth in this business, along with your other businesses also, especially on the G92 that\u2019s ramping?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I see. You know, the PSB business is not a -- when I heard capacity, I was surprised by that because in terms of total units, it\u2019s not insignificant. It\u2019s very large. We ship more Quadro solutions in one year than all of the other workstation companies in the history of workstations ever shipped. So it is a large number.  However, in the totality of all of our units shipped, it\u2019s not -- it would never get in the way. The only thing that when you said capacity that comes to mind for me was intellectual capacity. This is an intellectual capacity business. And I would love to have 100% more people who understands this business and has the skillsets of the people that are in that business instantaneously tomorrow. So if you find those people, let me know right away. \nUche Orji - UBS: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much, Jen-Hsun. Thanks for the time. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.\nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Just in the April quarter, you obviously had some very sort of robust sequential strength in workstations and I was wondering if you could give any color on how -- what would have driven that sequential up-tick. And then, as you go into the July quarter, do you have any color on how you would expect some of the different segments to look, or do you think it is going to be fairly even in terms of the 5% seasonal decline between the core units? And then lastly for Marv, I was wondering if you could just remind us how you perceived normal seasonality for the back half of the year and how you think that may shape within the current macro context. Thank you. \nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, I don\u2019t think there was any one particular segment of the workstation business that drove the growth quarter to quarter. I think it was across the board. They did well in all kinds of areas in Q1.  Jen-Hsun, do you have any comment about that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The only thing that I would say about our workstation and our professional solutions business is it has exceeded everybody\u2019s expectations and it is still growing. And I think that we are not following any market research in terms of the size of the market. We are beyond market research. I think that there\u2019s a -- when you are the market leader and you have grown the market as large as it has ever been, and yet you still see -- you still see headroom for growth, you just never know how big it\u2019s going to be.  Our customers don\u2019t know how bit it\u2019s going to be. Many of our sales people don\u2019t know how big it\u2019s going to be and you just have to go back to first principles, I think, to figure out how big it\u2019s going to be.  I think it\u2019s not really that easy to predict what PSB will do this year or next quarter but you just have to look at the underlying foundations of what makes the PSB business grow and what that business is all about and you will see the significant opportunities ahead of it. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Any other segment color for July? It sounds like you are saying notebooks will be slightly towards the lower end of -- any guidance on desktop, or any color on notebooks or workstations for July?\nMarvin D. Burkett: I think that notebook, as it makes the transition to Montevina will be -- probably decline more than corporate. We outlined a 5%. It\u2019s probably going to decline more than that.  I think the -- \nJen-Hsun Huang: But just to make sure that that\u2019s not because of share. That\u2019s just a transition thing. Everybody\u2019s notebook business is, in this transition, going to be slightly down but in terms of stabilized share, you don\u2019t want to communicate that it\u2019s going to be off by so much. \nMarvin D. Burkett: No, it\u2019s a transition quarter. I think that\u2019s the color for notebook. I think the big swing factor that you had no idea on or great difficult in projecting is what happens in desktop. We have some new product in there which could surprise us, both in strength and we\u2019ll see as we go through the quarter.  I don\u2019t think that in our projections we are expecting huge growth in anything but also not huge declines. I would guess it\u2019s more what we\u2019d call seasonal.\nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And what about second half seasonality?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Well, the normal seasonality that we see after I\u2019ll call it the 5% decline in Q2 is 10% plus growth in Q3. That\u2019s what normally happens. We\u2019ve had many years at 20% quarter to quarter, so it\u2019s 10% plus. And then you go into Q4 and it\u2019s slightly up from Q3, single digits. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And you feel you wouldn\u2019t get that this time, Marv?\nMarvin D. Burkett: You know, you tell me what\u2019s going to happen to consumer worldwide. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Fine, but as of now, you are planning for that kind of fairly broad but normal seasonal range, or how should we think about framing expectations?\nMarvin D. Burkett: We have no reason to have any different plans this year. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And margins, gross margin for the continuation of the year, how should we think about framing expectations for that after this weakness in the first quarter? Do you think you\u2019ll see steady improvement through the calendar year?\nMarvin D. Burkett: We\u2019ll talk to you in mid-August about Q3 margins. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And lastly if I may, so you are saying channel inventory is slightly higher, and your inventories, you would look to build some further inventory for the sequential improvement in the calendar third quarter -- that\u2019s correct?\nMarvin D. Burkett: Correct. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: And then, excuse me, lastly if I may, the ASPs in general, they seemed to be solid this quarter. How do you generally see the framework for ASP through the calendar year, i.e. through this second quarter with the lower revenue and how should we think about it? Should we think about it being stable from here?\nMarvin D. Burkett: You know, ASPs have been stable to slightly up for years now, so if you look back over what\u2019s Jen-Hsun has talked about, 10% growth in ASP year to year. I don\u2019t know why it would change. \nTim Luke - Lehman Brothers: Right. That\u2019s excellent. Thank you very much, guys. Good luck. \nOperator: Thank you. At this point, it is now my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mike Hara. Please go ahead. \nMichael Hara: Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to reporting on our progress for Q2. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which was posted on our website. One final note; we have announced the date of our Financial Analyst Day, which is set for April 7. With that, let us begin. GPU demand increased throughout the quarter, with GeForce and Quadro revenues growing to combined 22% quarter on quarter, and 97% over the same quarter a year ago. There were supply constraints from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and I expect the condition to persist. We continue to invest to drive market growth and share gain. NVIDIA innovates around the basic PC platform to create differentiated solutions and experiences, and in GeForce, gives the PC great graphics for video games and multimedia; Quadro transforms the PC into a workstation for designers; adding Tesla turns a PC server into a supercomputer; ION brings snappy graphics and multimedia to netbooks; and Tegra is fuelling the mobile computing revolution. Each of our product lines enable a rich experience through architecture and an ever-growing composition of software. Momentum for Tesla and CUDA continues at a strong pace ahead of the new Tesla 20. In November, CSIRO, Australia's premier supercomputer center officially opened the GPU supercomputing cluster. Researchers in Australia will use GPUs to address emerging scientific challenges in astronomy, medical imaging, and water resource management. The Tesla group also had its biggest show of the year this quarter at Supercomputing \u201909. The most significant news of Supercomputing \u201909 was the GPU cluster in Japan that won the prestigious Gordon Bell Award. In the category of price performance, a team led by Tsuyoshi Hamada of Nagasaki University, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Bristol and Riken conducted simulations used to study the evolution of star clusters with unprecedented efficiency. Supercomputing \u201909 was not a GPU conference, yet 12% of the papers presented and half of the posters used GPUs. 75 booths, which is one out of four, featured CUDA, compared to 33 booths and one booth at SC08 and SC07 respectively. HPCwire Readers\u2019 and Editors\u2019 Choice awards were presented at the conference, and NVIDIA received an unprecedented five awards. There are now approximately 3500 CUDA citations on Google Scholar, nearly 1000 CUDA videos on YouTube, and 1000 applications featured on CUDA Zone. Over 300 universities now teach CUDA, up from 40 just 18 months ago. That is a new University teaching CUDA every other day. For notebook PCs, users faced an impossible choice between performance and battery life. GPUs give the PC great graphics and snappiness, but consume more power. That is why we have invented Optimus, a powerful combination of software and hardware innovation that provides the performance of discrete graphics, while still delivering great battery life. Unlike earlier attempts at hybrid solutions, Optimus is seamless and transparent to the user. Notebook check reported \u201cWe are excited about Optimus, switchable graphics solutions will finally grow up, and offer to end users in all laptop classes distinct advantages\u201d. Engadget stated \u201cWe have always thought switchable graphics made a lot of sense on laptops. NVIDIA\u2019s new Optimus technology looks like it is going to bring it to the mainstream in a serious way\u201d. Seven models are available now, and we expect more than 50 systems will be available by summer. Optimus is unprecedented and unique to NVIDIA. We believe Optimus has the potential to expand the overall footprint for discrete GPUs by increasing the GPU attach rate for the notebook segment. Mobile computing will be the next personal computer revolution and it is just at the beginning. This was clearly evident at this year's Consumer Electronics Show. The undeniable trend of computing is surely smaller and more mobile. CES was the coming-out event for tablets, and the perfect venue for us to unveil our next generation Tegra mobile processor. It is the world's first processor for the mobile web, specifically designed for the high resolution needs of tablets. Tegra combines lightning quick browsing, streaming 1080p video, and Flash 10.1 acceleration with an immersive 3-D user interface and days of battery life. The combination gives habits access to the whole web, just as if you were at your desk. The entire Internet is an apps store when you have a native web experience. Facebook alone is host to more than 500,000 applications. An uncompromised browsing experience is what makes Tegra so disruptive. For the typical consumer, a Tegra tablet will meet all of their computing needs in a more convenient form factor that is instant on, always connected, and offer days of battery life. OEMs and carriers alike are equally excited about the potential of the tablet platform. NVIDIA, Motorola, and Verizon privately demonstrated streaming 1080p video, highlighting the combined capabilities of Tegra and a Motorola 4G wireless modem operating over the Verizon LTE pre-commercial network. We had multiple next-gen Tegra design wins in tablets, smartbooks, and smartphones, with the first of these expected to ship in Q2. 3-D stereo was the other big story at CES. 3-D Blu-Ray was everywhere, and 3-D TV is ubiquitous. ESPN announced the first 3-D network. NVIDIA has been a pioneering force in 3-D stereo, and this was clear at the show, where we took 3-D Vision to the next level, with 3-D Vision Surround. 3-D Vision Surround is the world\u2019s first consumer multimedia multi-display 3-D solution, that allows users to span 3-D content across three high-definition monitors or projectors for a truly breathtaking and immersive gaming experience. 3-D Vision is a great fit for high end notebooks. Asus launched its first 3-D notebook at CES, with more OEMs following suit in Q2. Over 420 games now support NVIDIA 3-D Vision. SLI defined high-end gaming, and we believe that 3-D stereo will do it again. We are very excited about Q1. Fermi is in production, and we plan to launch many new GPU products in the coming months, but we will save the details for later. With that, let me hand the call over to David.\nDavid White: Thanks, Mike. Q4 was another good quarter, driven by an improving PC market and better mix. Revenue was $982.5 million, above guidance, and up 9% sequentially, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of strong results. GAAP gross margin was 44.7%, significantly higher than guidance. GAAP OpEx was $304.4 million, in line with guidance and GAAP net income was $131.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share. The core GPU business had another strong quarter. Within that, our desktop GPU business was up 19%, notebook was up 27%, and workstation graphics was up 25% in the quarter. Demand was strong, but we were again constrained by supply across the board. Gross margin improved sequentially as a result of several factors: cost reductions due to yield improvements and reduced waste, favorable mix from our professional business, better mix within the PC GPU business, and increased revenues. Inventories at the end of the quarter were up 19% to $330.7 million. Inventory days on hand were 60 at the end of the quarter. Inventory in the channel remains low at around five weeks. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.73 billion, up approximately $94 million from the third quarter. Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011; revenue is expected to be flat, constrained by supply; GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be flat. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could clarify a little bit on your supply constraints facing for the first quarter. I am assuming that means that you are going to see seasonality in legacy products and you can't get enough of the new to offset it or maybe wrap some color around that, please?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Seasonality question, you know, we \u2013 the seasonality in the PC industry, Q1 is generally a down quarter, and if you take a look at \u2013 if you look at what most companies have guided, they have guided down sequentially. We are guiding flat, and if we had a sufficient supply to support the ramps of the products that we are going into production with right now, we would guide further up. You know, our company is currently in a growth phase. There are new products in many new markets, as well as going into a new product generation. So there is a lot different reasons why we are expecting to grow and our suppliers are working as hard as they can for us and their yields are improving. However, we remain constrained.\nAlex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities: Okay, if I could get a follow-up on your Optimus technology, when are you expecting that to ramp in force in the market and where do you see the earliest adoption occurring?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Optimus is going to show up in notebooks and it is designed for notebooks and you should expect to see it starting to ship in the April timeframe, I think will be the first laptop, and then it will just start ramping, about 50 models or so and we are getting new models as we speak and we will ramp throughout the year.\nAlex Gauna \u2013 JMP Securities: Okay, thanks very much. Congratulations, nice quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Yes, thanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva with Kaufman Brothers. Please proceed with your question.\nSuji DeSilva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Thanks. Can you guys help us understand what the impact was on the quarter from the constraints and perhaps on the guidance as well just to give a sense? I just wanted to understand where the 40 nm constraints come off at this point.\nJen-Hsun Huang:\n :\nSuji DeSilva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Great. And then one other question on MCP, I know you are going to fold that into GPU going forward, but can you help us understand what your [inaudible] of that product by itself or should we not, should we think of it as more being surely folded into the GPU in terms of forward revenues?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There is a \u2013 let me make a comment and then I will have David make some comments. The first thing is that our MCP business was down quarter to quarter and we are expecting it to grow quarter to quarter for Q1 and we are in the process of ramping what has been internally code-named MCP-89, a 40 nm chipset, and we are really excited about that. And so next year, the chipset business is going to do nicely for us. On top of that, we have created two new technologies that over time, will supplement the MCP business that we are transitioning out of. One of them is called the ION. You know, ION will do for netbooks what GeForce does for PCs. And we today have the \u2013 I think Acer announced today \u2013 well, I am pretty sure Acer announced today at the Mobile World Conference our first second-generation ION design win. And so my sense is that over time, the netbook market will segment just as the PC market has and there will be basic netbooks, based on Atom, and then there will be netbooks that are premium netbooks that are designed to deliver the best possible experience and those people are calling ION netbooks. And so, we can capture 10% or 25% of that marketplace, a market that is currently [inaudible] and also the fastest-growing segment in the PC industry, ION should be a nice business for us. And then the second technology Mike was talking about earlier called Optimus is really a game-changer for us and it solves the single largest issue that has kept GPUs from growing further into the notebook marketplace and that is power dissipation or battery life. And so Optimus allows us now to automatically completely invisibly from the user to switch off to completely zero-power state and consume absolutely no power when it is not in use and whenever the user uses an application that can benefit from a GPU, we instantly turn on and the user never knows the difference. And so you now have the best of battery life as well as the benefits of a GPU, the performance of a GPU, you know, without any compromise. And so those two technologies I think not only will help us grow our opportunities in the marketplace, and hopefully make up more than plenty of the MCP business that will decline a couple of years from now.\nSuji DeSilva \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Okay, thanks, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Suji.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your questions.\nDan Morris \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Guys, this is Dan Morris calling in for Rick. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the gross margins, you know, you have expanded it pretty nicely over the last two quarters. As I look at some of your new products especially Tesla and Tegra, you guys are ramping over the next few quarters, it seems like you have a nice tailwind mix. Could you just talk to us a little bit about expectations for gross margins and further opportunities for margin expansion?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the only thing I would add, Dan, is we don\u2019t typically give guidance out past the first quarter, but as we have talked about previously, you know, we expect our Quadro, our Tesla, and our Tegra business to become a greater part of our mix over time as those businesses ramp. Those three businesses all carry a gross margin that is above even our current corporate weighted average. And so, as those products ramp and become a richer part of our mix, we would expect to see further lift in our gross margins. And you know, we have indicated in the past that we expect Tegra to, you know, ramp substantially in the second half of the year. We would reiterate our belief of that and hopefully with that, you know, we would see some margin expansion with it.\nDan Morris \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. And as a follow-up, could you just talk about the pricing environment in GPU and you know, what happens in the second half, assuming that the 40 nm capacity issues remain?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, you are asking a question for a state of supply that we are all hoping for, which is when they abate. My sense is that supply will remain constrained for at least the first half of the year, and as we ramp further new products into the marketplace, you know, I surely hope that the supply situation will be there to sort it. In terms of pricing, you know, we increasingly are shifting our focus towards products and markets where we have a great differentiation. And if you look at the products that we offer today in mass market, GeForce for example, increasingly, CUDA brings unique capabilities to it. We are the only supplier of 3-D stereo in the PC market and 3-D Vision only works with GeForce and so we are increasingly developing capabilities that are very differentiated on top of our processor brands. And so hopefully, those differentiations will be valued in the marketplace and accordingly reward us with a price medium over time.\nDan Morris \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: All right. Thanks, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot, Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital. Please proceed with your questions.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital: Hey, guys. Nice job on the results. Can you talk a little bit about attach rates for GPUs, both in desktop and notebook, where were they, where are they, where do you think they can go?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I don't think this quarter the GPU attach rate changed substantially. And so, I will review the numbers again but my last look at the numbers, it was relatively stable. If anything, on the notebook side, it increased slightly in my recollection. And so, yes, there we go. Okay. So Chris just showed me some numbers on the desktop side, they were flat and on the notebook side, they were up about five points. And so, my guess is that people are increasingly recognizing the importance of the GPU, and there are so many things that you do now that the GPU adds value to. And the videogame market is obviously still very large, the online game market is very, very large and people who are enjoying high-definition movies on their PC or just want snappy graphics where two processors simply does a better job than one, you know, for their PCs, they are increasingly recognizing the benefits of GPUs. The other thing is that in the consumer market, the GPU attach rate is just much higher and the consumer segment is really the fastest-growing segment right now. And so our sense is that the GPU attach rate is going to continue to grow. The separation between the integrated graphics, whether it is on a chipset or on a CPU, integrated is integrated. That comparison to a discrete GPU is in fact the technology is growing further and further apart. The GPU is in fact becoming more and more advanced relative to integrated graphics versus previous years. And so my sense is that this trend is going to continue.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital: I must thank you for preempting my follow-up. So I will ask another one, which is, I guess for David. How do you see operating expenses tracking over the rest of this year, just generally, should it be sloping up, are you guys going to be increasing your investment levels, any color there would be great for the models?\nDavid White: Well, we guided flat, obviously, and I think as we talked about last quarter, you know, our Q4 just ended was a 14-week quarter. And so, we had more expenses in that quarter than what we would typically carry. We got it flat because as you recall last year, we had a number of temporary cost reduction measures in place which we are restoring, some of those are which related to wage reductions and so forth that a lot of our employees were carrying. So those tended to offset one another, and as you see, we got a flat in Q1. I would expect that we would be roughly flat in the first half of the year and we will just have to wait and see how revenue shapes up for the second half to give any further guidance beyond that.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital: Let me ask one more question, which is, do you think your customers are building inventory, meaning, is any of the revenue strength you guys are seeing temporary inventory build and does that hamper second half's revenue seasonality? Thank you so much.\nDavid White: If you look at our channel inventory, which is where we sell a lot of our vast majority of our desktop GeForce business, that channel inventory has been roughly stable throughout the year. It has been teetering in the three to four week range. We had a one-week uptick in that in the fourth quarter. This is probably the first sign we have seen of any uptick in channel inventory now this year. But we still consider that pretty modest, you know, certainly well below where it has been historically and as a result of even those low levels, we continue to have stock-out situations, which we try to obviously avoid. So right now, I don't think we have got really any indicators that would tell us that we have got an inventory build going on, either in the channel or even at the OEM companies that we sell to. So, at some point, we know that supply will catch up with demand and you know, I think we just have to be very alert to make sure that we see the early indicators of that and we can respond as early as we can.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me just make a comment on top of that \u2013 everything David said was right. At the highest level, the last couple of years, we have invested in R&D pretty aggressively. And we invested in R&D so that we could drive our top-line growth. And so, if there is anything at all, and because as we go into this year, we have so many new products, whether it is Tegra or the Fermi architecture, or the Tesla product line, or some exciting new product lines that we are planning for Quadro, all of these growth opportunities are a result of the R&D investment that we have made. And so if there is anything at all, we would just love to have the supply to support the growth. And so, we are looking forward to that.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the call. Jen-Hsun, I want to make sure I understood a comment that you made a little bit earlier when you were talking about the supply constraints, you were saying that the order of the supply constraints, if you didn't have the supply constraints, you could have done another couple of hundred million dollars in revenue. First question, did I hear that correctly and second of all, can you help us understand a little bit is that really just focused in GPU where you could have had that extra revenue and can you help us give us any color on who is not getting parts, you know, is it notebook, is it the channel, can you give us a little bit of granularity there, if I did understand that correctly?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I was trying not to give you an exact number, and I probably shouldn\u2019t have given you a number at all. Because we really don't know when supply \u2013 we knew that during the quarter, channel inventory was too low. When David says that channel inventory was five weeks, five weeks average in fact means gap outs in many regions around the world. And you can only measure channel inventory really in the final analysis to what the average is, but we know that certain regions are much harder than other regions and it is hard to keep them from stocking out. And the second thing is OEMs, without exception, notebook OEMs were handing out the whole quarter and we worked quite hard to keep them from gapping out throughout the quarter, and we weren\u2019t successful most of the time. And so, there were challenges in fulfilling the demand that we did have throughout the quarter.\nDaniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA: Am I correct in assuming that you were talking about really GPU, there were no shortages in chipset or in Tegra or in Quadro?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Tegra and Quadro, Tegra\u2019s production ramp is rather modest right now, and Quadro\u2019s volume relative to GeForce is small, although the revenues are high, the actual units are relatively small. And so, frontal analysis, whenever you have a gap-out situation over in your highest line products, and in our case, it would be GeForce.\nDaniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA: Okay. And just a follow on that, is this giving you any pricing power, you know, was there any contribution to the gross margin, obviously, if you are posting a good gross margin number. Are you getting some pricing power because of this?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we certainly haven\u2019t raised prices on the marketplace. This is the benefit of being this constrained that you could make adjustments on product mix. But those adjustments are still rather hard to do because customers are lined up and we have made commitments to customers with respect to the parts that we would ship them. And so, to the best of our ability, we try to honor those commitments. And so supply constraints are \u2013 it makes the market a little bit less disruptive from a pricing perspective, because people are mostly focused on fulfilling demand. And this helps us with some amount of modest mix benefits. But overall, we haven't raised prices on the customers.\nDaniel Berenbaum \u2013 Auriga USA: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks. You know, when you take into account all the moving pieces at NVIDIA for this upcoming year, you know, think about the MCP business versus think about Tegra for example. When I look at what would be a seasonal year, if we assumed it would be a seasonal year for PCs, should we expect above, below, or average seasonal growth for NVIDIA?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Right now, we are constrained at least to the first half, right? So, seasonality, I don't think is going to have a significant bearing on what revenue we are going to put up on the top-line. Our top-line is going to be more dictated by allocation than it is by the normal end-user seasonality. The second half is anyone's guess.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup: Yes, okay.\nJen-Hsun Huang: If you look at the moving parts, it kind of boils down to the \u2013 Fermi is going to be a growth driver for us. We have, you know, we are in mass production now of Fermi and Fermi not only ships into the GeForce market and brings incredible new capabilities to that market, Fermi also grows into two other markets. One is Tesla and OEMs are lined up and designing servers and high performance supercomputers dedicated to Tesla, supercomputers are being built around the world waiting for the new Tesla. And so, this Fermi architecture grows into new markets, it also creates new types of products for our Quadro family and so those are new growth drivers. So the Fermi architecture is really important to us. The second is 3-D Vision. You know, 3-D is going to be really big and is going to redefine, as Mike says, what a gaming notebook is going to be, just as gaming PC is going to be, just as SLI did a few years ago, defined what a gaming PC is, 3-D Vision will now. And so you have already seen the Asus Tech notebook, Acer has a product now, Dell just announced their product today, and we are expecting 3-D Vision to be adopted by nearly every PC OEM in the world. They will also be adopted by the workstation market. So 3-D Vision is going to be important. And then lastly, Tegra is a brand-new product line for us. And so those are all growth drivers and then I think I said last time and I think this time I would reinforce that statement that the MCP product line will do well this year, although it is our last chipset for Intel processors. You know, we are expecting MCP-89 to be far, far superior to what you can see get on an Avondale or any integrated CPU from Intel today and so I think we are going to see it do quite nicely.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun. One point of clarification and one other question. On the clarification perspective, you mentioned that you obviously see a supply constraint and yet you were able to build inventory yourself. Is that because you are forgoing sales this quarter in order to build the right inventory for next quarter and then the question is, just on the workstation side of the house, notwithstanding your point made on Fermi just now, how sustainable do think the workstation strength that you are seeing is as you look beyond the current quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The inventory situation happened as a result of wafers that came in late in the quarter that we couldn't get through our backend process and then shipped to customers. And so the backend process includes [inaudible] and with the complexity of the GPUs these days, requires quite substantial battery to go along with it. And so we just couldn't get it through the backend to ship to customers. Customers were clamoring for parts all the way through the end of the quarter. So we will ship it to them as soon as we can, we just couldn't get it through the backend. Your second question is about workstations. I think the workstation market is going to continue to improve from this point forward. You know, the vast majority of the world\u2019s industries held back on spending towards the latter part of the year before and the early part of this last year. And technology has really, really moved forward and until and unless they invest in tools, unless they invest in computing, they really can't build products. And so, the Quadro business has improved quarter on quarter. I think it was some 20% or so. You know, my guess is that \u2013 and it is still off of its historical highs. And this historical highs I think is going to ultimately be \u2013 you know will exceed that in some period of time, because back when we had the historical high about two years ago, I think a year and a half ago, with the recession, the world wasn't nearly as globalized from an industrial design standpoint. China wasn't nearly as progressed from a design perspective; it was a manufacturing powerhouse, but it now it has turned into a design powerhouse as well. And so you are going to see that projects are being worked on by teams on the same projects around the world and so there would be people in Europe working with engineers in the United States working with engineers in China and to do that, you have to use the same database and you have to use the same architecture, and so my belief is that the workstation market is going to 2.9 for the next couple of years.\nGlen Yeung \u2013 Citigroup: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I guess, could you talk a little bit about your customer order patterns at this point and clearly, your supply constraint, but are customers putting as much backlog on you today as they were three months ago and so in the context of that plus the supply constraints, how should we think about what is likely to happen for Q2 in terms of revenues?\nDavid White: Yes, I think I can answer that, James. You know, if you look at the last three quarters, we have opened each of the last three quarters with a fairly healthy typical backlog at the start of each one. In fact, that has been at near-record levels, at least as far as I can tell. And that has helped significantly with linearity of product deliveries, linearity of collections for example et cetera, and has made our businesses a little bit more predictable than what has been as well because we have had less turns business actually generate within the quarter. And as we go into Q1, our backlog \u2013 the opening position is in relatively the same position it was at the beginning of Q4. And so, we will open Q1 with a fair amount of our business already visible to us.\nJen-Hsun Huang: And in terms of Q2, the benefit of Q2 is it is going to benefit from quite a few growth drivers that are firing at the same time. We have got new GeForce products, new Quadro products, new Tesla products and Tegra products and 3-D Vision products all cranking. So this is \u2013 we are just beginning now of a new product cycle and this new product cycle is driven by a revolutionary architecture called Fermi. And so we are really excited about that and can\u2019t wait to get to it.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thanks. That was very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just briefly, I think you talked about 40 nm products being 19% of shipments last quarter. Can you give us an update of what that was this quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have really not broken that out this time. I think we have decided that it would be just better to show the vector and the vector was up 178% quarter to quarter.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: 40 nm?\nJen-Hsun Huang: For 40 nm, yes.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint AmTech. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: Great, and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Can you guys talk a little bit about what drove the change in stock-comp reporting? Is there any sort of underlying change to the compensation structure that you are working with the employees?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You mean the fact that our non-GAAP now includes stock-based compensation, is that what you mean, Doug?\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: Correct.\nJen-Hsun Huang: There was really no change in compensation at all. In fact, if you look at the commentary and so forth, I think you would see that it is relatively flat quarter over quarter. What really kind of guided is that we would like to get closer to a GAAP reporting structure and most of the analysts and so forth now report GAAP and non-GAAP numbers and so forth and so our thought was that would just remove one more layer of noise in our story by reporting GAAP when we can report GAAP and only have to talk about non-GAAP when there is an extraordinary item that we need to discuss.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: All right, great. And if you could talk a little bit about use of cash and what your thinking is on the buyback of your shares, we are now sort of seeing dilution creep up every quarter, you are almost back to where you were. I believe when you were at this level in the past, you talked about wanting to hold dilution down. Is that still something you are thinking about?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, it is certainly something that we have discussions on and sometime this year, will probably be more \u2013 be able to talk more openly about what is the plan on dealing with it.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: And then my last one is really, the Fermi architecture, how quickly do you guys think you are going to be able to take that architecture to the full product line? What is sort of the \u2013 what expectation should we have as far as getting those into the mainstream and if my understanding is correct, you are going to launch that at the high end.\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, all of that just depends on 40 nm supply and we are trying to finesse it the best we possibly can. You know, for the entry-level products, the truth is that the new architectures, the very, very entry-level GPUs are probably not extremely well appreciated anyhow. And so, you know, the reasons why people buy the new architectures tend to be early adopters and they tend to the game enthusiasts or workstation designers or creative artists or \u2013 there are very specific reasons why it really enhances their experience. Our current generation GPUs are fabulous and all the things that mainstream consumers would use their computer for. You know, all of the high-definition videos, even plays 3-D Blu-Ray. We are the only GPU that processes 3-D Blu-Ray completely in the GPU. All of them have CUDA and they are all compatible with the Fermi architecture, and now, all of them have Optimus. Right? So I think the mainstream GPUs are really fabulous and has been enhanced recently with some really great features and so my sense is that they are going to continue to do quite nicely in the marketplace. And then we will just transition as fast as we can.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: All right. And is there any change to your expectations in the ramp for Tegra during the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, not much has changed. We are currently working on quite a few tablets, and these tablets are \u2013 some are tablets and some are tablets with keywords and there is all kinds of different form factors, there is five-inch versions, there are seven-inch versions, there are 10-inch versions and some are being created by computer companies, some are being created by consumer electronics companies and some are created by mobile companies. And everybody has a slightly different perspective on how they would take it to market, some really excited about that. Today, I think it is just literally today in Barcelona, Adobe and NVIDIA demonstrated the world's first interactive reader on a mobile device, a magazine reader on a mobile device. And the Wired magazine demonstrated an interactive version of Wired, and if you get a chance to see it on the web, it is just really stunning, it is just completely stunning. You know, the experience of reading a magazine that comes to life when you touch it on a Tegra tablet is just really something else. And so, now we have the full Internet on Tegra. Flash 10.1 is completely accelerated on our GPU. So the 100 million websites around the world now just work. You have multitasking, so you could read a magazine, close it, go look up something on the web, close that, and come back to read your magazine exactly where you left off and you could also enjoy digital magazines and future digital books. And so, I think this form factor is really going to do nicely and I can't wait to start ramping it.\nDoug Freedman \u2013 Broadpoint AmTech: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Aberle with Caris & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Aberle \u2013 Caris & Company: Good afternoon. My question is, so given the scenario where 40 nm supply is constrained throughout all of 2010; my guess is you guys have to make some pretty tough decisions on how to allocate the supply that you do have. Given you guys are transitioning GPU, desktop, and notebook over to 40 nm, Tegra 2 is 40 nm, Tesla 2 is 40 nm; how do you guys make those decisions as we roll through the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I said that supply was going to be constrained; I didn't say supply was going to be constant. We are expecting a big year, but frankly, if we had more supply, we would have a bigger year. And so, we just have to keep working at it. You know, [inaudible] is doing a fabulous job improving their yields and if you just look at from August when we first started ramping to now, the yield improvements have been done and the execution that their teams have gone through is just fabulous. This is a really extraordinary company and what they have done with 40 nm yields over the last several months is really fabulous. And so, if the trend continues, things are going to look a lot better and so we are hoping for it to continue, we are working hard together to make it improve and so I am hoping that supply will abate, I think that was the work I used earlier, sooner than later, because we can certainly use the wafers to drive our growth.\nNicholas Aberle \u2013 Caris & Company: Got you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Either way, we are still expecting a lot of wafers this year and improved yields and a lot more supply than obviously now.\nNicholas Aberle \u2013 Caris & Company: Yes, I mean in the scenario that you guys don't get all that you want, which sounds like you are at least not going to get all that you want in the first half of the year, I mean you guys are going to make decisions on how to allocate I was just curious on how you made the decisions to allocate that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are making the decisions now. We made the decisions last quarter. We are making decisions this quarter. And every commitment that we make, we need to fulfill. And so we have to be thoughtful about the commitments we do make. Our customers are working very closely with us now. Everybody has just done a much, much better job, aligning forecasts, and I appreciate that and so, we are making those trade-offs. And so, I think one of the things that you give up on is you give up on any amount of inventory, and we don't have very much inventory at all in the grand scheme of things, considering the velocity of our business. So there is not much buffer and everything is metal. That is one of the challenges of being constrained, but our most important objective is to meet the commitments that we have made to our customers.\nNicholas Aberle \u2013 Caris & Company: Got you. We haven't really talked about PlayStation 3 much. I just curious was that a little bit soft during the quarter, what are your expectations for PS3 this year and given there is a transition coming up; do you expect to be part of that transition?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Seasonally, they are lower I think in our fourth quarter, just the way they ramp in the holidays and so forth. So it was seasonally weaker in the fourth quarter. You know, I think it would be probably an appropriate question what they think Sony's business is going to do over the next year. So I am not sure I want to answer the balance of that question.\nNicholas Aberle \u2013 Caris & Company: Thanks, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks a lot, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda with Roth Capital Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Roth Capital Partners: Thank you. I have a question about gross margins. You know, Jen-Hsun, this is basically, as far as I can tell, pretty much a record gross margin, maybe even better than your record if you assume this on a non-GAAP business, exclude this dot com. It seems like your new products basically have better gross margin than your current business, as that mix improves, this should only get better. Is there a target that you would like to let us think about longer term where you think you can get to?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me answer it in pieces. First of all, I don't think this is our record. And secondarily, it is not at the internal targets. You know, our business is increasingly moving from a great shift business to much more of a software rich business. If you look at our Quadro business, it is nearly all software. You know, the enormous R&D that we invest in Quadro and in the technology we create for Quadro is all software, because for anyone else, it is still built on NVIDIA GPUs. So you see the same thing with GeForce now. The work that we did in 3-D Vision, tons of software. The work that we did with 3-D Blu-Ray, tons of software. You know, so the work that we do with CUDA, the work we do with Physx, tons of software. So I think increasingly, that is going to become the nature of our business. Tesla is just all software, right, software tools and software compilers, libraries and I mean these are the profilers and debuggers. I mean, it has become increasingly a software-oriented type business and that is where our differentiation really is and that is where NVIDIA has historically been really, really excellent. And so in order for us to differentiate the basic commodity platform and turn it into an extraordinary experience for gamers or scientists or digital creators or for clouds or for netbooks or for tablets, it is increasingly a software business. And so that is where a lot of our differentiation becomes and I think if you think about our business from that perspective, our gross margin of the 44 points or the 44.7% that we had this quarter should be far from our expectations.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Roth Capital Partners: Okay. And then one question about your \u2013 products, so if you look at Tegra, you have talked a lot about the tablet potential there. Where do you see taking that business? You think that will be confined to tablets or are you expecting to take them to smartphones and then, with Fermi, is there a possibility with ASP growth that you could offset normal seasonality when it starts to launch significantly in the second quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think Fermi will vary substantially offset any seasonality; that is my expectation. Because Q2 is going to be the quarter when Fermi is hitting the pull stride, and it won\u2019t just be one Fermi product, there will be a couple of Fermi products to span many different price ranges, but also the Fermi products will span GeForce and Quadro and Tesla. And so we are going to be ramping now on Fermi architecture products through Q2 and we are building a lot of it. So I am really excited about the upcoming launch of Fermi and I think it will more than offset the seasonality that we usually see in Q2. And then the question about Tegra, you know, our focus on Tegra is initially on the markets where high resolution and snappy performance is really important. You know, what NVIDIA is really great at is multimedia and great snappy performance, high-performance computing. And so, if you want a great experience with a touch tablet and the resolution is high and it is in high-def, choosing NVIDIA, choosing Tegra is really your best choice. And so we are going to focus our energy on the marketplaces where we could add the most value and initially, those are tablets, but we are seeing a lot of over-the-top TV opportunities and engaging a few of those and you also heard that Audi has standardized on NVIDIA graphics starting this year in America and in the year 2012 everywhere around the world. And we are just expanding from there. So I think the Tegra opportunity is quite large for us, and we are just going to focus on where to start from where we have the most value first.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Roth Capital Partners: Thanks, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks, Arnab.\nOperator: And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you.\nMichael Hara: Thank you, everyone.

We are making a few changes to our format moving forward. As you may have noted, we posted David\u2019s financial overview on our website prior to today\u2019s call. In addition, I will be providing the corporate overview and Jen-Hsun will be available for the question and answer portion.  With that, let\u2019s begin.  We continued to make good progress in the third quarter. GPU demand continued to steadily increase, driven by a health market environment and new applications that require GPUs. Our unprecedented investments in parallel computing are creating change and opportunity and are the foundation of our growth in the coming year. We believe we are in the midst of a giant leap in computer graphics. The GPU continues to advance the most parallel of applications, 3D graphics, and it is now poised to revolutionize a wide range of industries by making parallel computing mainstream.  Consumers needs have changed and the GPU is key to meeting them. The Internet is today\u2019s killer app and social media, video, and digital photography have seen massive growth.  These are highly parallel tasks that are much better suited to a GPU than a CPU. From handhelds to data centers, today\u2019s most important computing problems are parallel. For handheld devices, parallel computing on GPUs delivers rich media and enables an uncompromised Internet experienced. The first TEGRA devices, Microsoft Zune HD and the Samsung M1, started shipping in Q3.  PC gamers are aggressive adopters of new technology. Just as SLI permanently changed the meaning of high definition gaming, PhysX and 3D stereo are bringing an even more profound change, making games surprising and magical again. Because of the extraordinary impact PhysX has on game playing experience, it has the potential to be a defining feature of gaming PCs, just as SLI is today.  Parallel computing also provides 3D stereo for movies and photos and remarkable speed ups for photo and video editing. In the future, even PCs that already have a graphics controller integrated with the CPU will require a GPU for compute.  Professional users will greatly benefit from the combination of computational graphics and parallel computing. Even for pure graphics applications, parallel computing is being used to make images more realistic by simulating the real world from PhysX to photons. Movie production houses that worked on Terminator Salvation and Star Trek ran color grading and image processing 20 times faster using parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs.  Our leadership position and innovative software, parallel programming language, development environment, libraries for PhysX, ray tracing, scene management, and many other aspects of a visual computing solution will not only solidify our market share, it will expand the size of the business.  Data centers are constrained by space, power, and cooling so the improvements from parallel computing and performance per cubic foot are game changing. TESLA development clusters are at 33 of the top 500 super computing sites. Oak Ridge National Labs announced in September that it plans to build the world\u2019s most powerful super computer with our GPUs.  But GPUs in the data center represent more than just evolution. They are a discontinuity that opens up new application and grows the entire market. For example, we recently announced a reality server, a powerful combination of GPUs and software that streams interactive photorealistic 3D applications to any web connected PC, laptop, netbook or smartphone from the data center, a rendering that used to take hours and require highly skilled technical specialist can now be developed interactively by designers and artists. Reality server is an example of the future of 3D web applications.  Momentum behind parallel computing is unlike anything in the industry. We held our first GPU technology conference last month and even after closing registration early, we were over subscribed by 50%. 1500 people from over 40 countries listened, learned and shared during 200 hours of sessions. At one point, more than 35,000 people were watching online.  Also at GTC, we announced a revolutionary [inaudible] compute architectural. [inaudible] based products will become the foundation of our most powerful processors ever, targeted for both graphic and computation. We continue to invest deeply in programmability and [FIRMY] now provides the capability to write applications in C++.  We have created a development environment, code named Nexus, which integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio, the world\u2019s first unified programming environment for a parallel computing architecture with the CPU and GPU in a co-processing configuration.  NVIDIA's growth strategy is simple and singular -- be the absolute best in the world in visual and parallel computing, to use GPUs to transform computing experiences. The GPU will be incorporated into all kinds of [inaudible] platforms beyond PCs. By focusing our R&D efforts to advance visual and parallel computing, we are creating breakthrough solutions to address some of the most important challenges in computing today.  Let me now hand the call over to David. \nDavid White: Thanks, Mike. Q3 was a strong quarter, driven by an improving PC market and better mix. Revenue was $903.2 million, above our guidance and up 16% sequentially, making the third consecutive quarter of top line strong growth.  Gross margin was 43.4%, 41% on a non-GAAP basis, significantly higher than guidance.  GAAP operating expenses was just under $284 million, marginally above guidance and GAAP net income was $107.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Non-GAAP income was also $0.19 per diluted share.  Our core GPU business was particularly strong, up almost 25% sequentially. Within that, our desktop and notebook GPU segments were up 19% and over 41% respectively quarter over quarter. While demand was strong, we were supply constrained throughout the quarter, particularly in our 40-nanometer products. 40-nanometer products for desktop and notebook constituted 19% of our total GPU revenue in the quarter.  Our professional business saw another quarter of growth, up 11% sequentially. While revenues in this business are still well below their levels of a year ago, quotation activity continues to gain momentum and is encouraging. Gross margin improved sequentially as a result of several factors -- significantly higher than anticipated unit sales of GPUs; improved 55-nanometer yields as well as other cost reductions; and more favorable product mix across businesses, and particularly better mix within the GPU business itself.  Inventories at the end of the quarter were essentially flat compared with the prior quarter. Inventory days on hand improved to 47, calculated on a non-GAAP basis, a 4-day improvement over the second quarter. Inventory in the channel remains very low at around a month. With demand outstripping supply, we don\u2019t see OEMs in the channel building inventory. Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 is as follows -- revenue is expected to be up slightly, approximately 2% from the third quarter. While revenue for 40-nanometer products is expected to grow significantly quarter over quarter, we expect 40-nanometer products to be supply constrained throughout the quarter; GAAP gross margin is expected to be 40% to 42%, essentially flat with Q3 excluding the insurance reimbursement; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $305 million. This is up from the third quarter due primarily to our fourth quarter comprising 14 weeks versus the usual 13 weeks, as well as costs relating to a record number of product bring-ups.  This concludes our formal remarks so at this time, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Operator. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Broadpoint Amtech.\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech: I guess I would start with we have seen several quarters now where you have significantly exceeded your guidance. Can you talk a little bit about the business processes that you have in place to forecast your business and whether you are finding yourself sort of short of product going forward as a result of not really getting accurate forecasts from your customers in your channel?\nDavid White: Doug, our process starts really at the very base line of our field sales force and we gather forecasts from the field, both the OEMs and to the extent we can, through the channels. We also at the same time try and correlate that with what market forecasters expect to be growth rates in the various end markets we participate in. And from that, we set revenue plans and from that, we set wafer start plans ultimately.  I think the challenge for probably everyone in the industry right now is that demand has been more robust than what anyone has been able to particularly foresee and given that you\u2019ve got a 12 to 13 week lead time from the date you decide you want more volume to the date that you can ship that volume, we are being surprised by robust demand within that lead time and so it\u2019s a good thing in some respects. I think the down side for us has been that as a result, we are -- we have been supply constrained. But we do look at a number of different inputs as it relates in terms of compiling our forecasts and trying to challenge our crystal ball, so to speak. \nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech: All right. If we could move in and focus in on one segment of the business, the chipsets, it appears during the quarter you guys have made a little bit of a change in tone towards the outlook for your chipset business. Can you talk about that and can you talk a little bit about what is going on over with the AMD chipset, the downturn there you attribute to their supply constraints? Is there any thought that you might be also possibly experiencing some share loss in that piece of business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our primary AMD chipset today is a chipset called the MCP61. The MCP61 is the only single chip solution in the marketplace today and it enables the lowest cost solution for an AMD platform. There is really at this point nothing that I know how to do and nor do I believe anybody else can build a chipset that is as low cost at a system level as MCP61.  You know that the AMD market is primarily mainstream desktop and then you also know that for a variety of reasons, AMD CPUs lost share last quarter. And so when AMD CPUs loses share, they lose share primarily in the mainstream market and so that is basically what we experienced.  I don\u2019t think we lost any share within the AMD CPU market. I think the AMD CPU lost share in the mainstream desktop PC market.  If the AMD CPU recovers some share relative to Intel, we\u2019ll grow the MPC61 business again, and so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, certainly well beyond several quarters, the MCP61 is going to be a wonderful chipset for AMD processors.  The second question is a longer term about our chipset. You know that we have a dispute with Intel and it is now impossible for us to build next generation chipsets with all the allegations that they are making in the market and with the dispute hanging over it.  We have one major generation of the current architecture post MPC79. It is a really exciting new MCP next generation and we are expecting it to be very successful. The customer feedback has been quite wonderful and while MCP79\u2019s GPU capability already far exceeds that of Erindale, MPC89 will take it that much further and so MCP89 is our next major generation of this architecture, and so we have -- we are expecting our chipset business overall to do quite nicely through next year and beyond. The only thing that I have said and I want it to be very clear is that we have no intentions at this point of building a DMI based chipset but otherwise, we have ongoing investments as well as chipset developments in the current architecture. \nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech: Great, thank you for that clarity and I will jump back in the queue for the follow-ups that I do have. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank: I guess from an end demand perspective, first and foremost, beyond the limitations on the supply side, are you seeing any sort of abnormal seasonality or inventory related impact on demand as we look into the fourth quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, demand is really strong. We came into this quarter with very, very strong demand again. Last quarter we were supply constrained from the very first day of the quarter and it got more and more challenging as demand continued to grow. I think that Mercury Research showed that we lost market share. I think we did lose market share. We came out of the quarter not being able to fulfill several million units of demand [orders], not to mention the turns business that would have been on top of that. And so the demand on our GPUs at the moment is very, very high.  Is it because of Windows 7? It could be. You know, it\u2019s -- I hope that it is and I hope that it is because people\u2019s PCs are getting rather old and they could use a refresh. I hope that it is because the adoption of GPUs is higher than before. And so we are seeing very, very strong demand at the moment. I expect us to be supply constrained and the projections that we are giving you guys are a supply constrained forecast. And so I am expecting us to be supply constrained and we are going to fight really hard to make up as much as we can but demand is pretty strong out there right now. \nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank: I guess as a follow-up, also looking at your MCP business, it was helpful you hear how you think it is going to play out but if we try to get a little more granular on that, the fact that you are not planning to do any of the DMI side of things, you are at $250 million in revenues now. When do you think it starts to impact your overall chipset business that you are making the choice or Intel is forcing the choice that you won't be supporting the new architecture? When would we start to see that on the revenue side of the equation?\nJen-Hsun Huang: My sense is that we will see our -- and I am just giving you my crystal ball, who knows -- but based on our analysis, my sense is that our chipset business at a peak probably around Q3, Q4 next year, and no ramp down from there. And it just depends on available CPUs that we can connect to, customer demand for Ion, so on and so forth -- our competitiveness relative to Erindale CPUs. You know, Erindale has integrated graphics but MCP79 already has better GPU technology and MCP89 takes that even further and because Windows 7 requires Direct Compute and OpenCL and Direct Compute are becoming increasingly important, what we call GPU computing, I think that the disparity between our MPC and Intel\u2019s integrated graphics is growing, not shrinking and it\u2019s growing by leaps and bounds at the moment.  And so I think those are all [played] factors but without much estimation, I think that our chipset business is likely to continue to grow for the foreseeable future, or has the opportunity to grow, certainly. \nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: I guess first of all on the gross margins, could you maybe give us some quantification about how much of that improvement was driven by improved mix with the transition to 55 and 40-nanometer and how much was driven by better product cost based on that or better mix based on more workstations or just higher end GPUs?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t broken that stuff out but I think that this quarter, it\u2019s pretty clear that everything grew. We have -- if you were following us in previous quarters, you knew that 65-nanometer was an element of our gross margin drag that we had to work through and as of last quarter, we had worked that mostly out of our system and so we are freshly, we are all 55 and all 40-nanometer.  Gross margins on 55 and 40-nanometer products are similar. There\u2019s -- 55 is fine, it\u2019s a perfectly gross margin and so will 40 be. And so I think that in terms of our main business, core mainstream business, it would be not having any 65s or having very little 65s that plays the biggest factor.  The second thing is PSG overall growing is very high leverage for us. You know that our position in the workstation business is very high and it\u2019s high not because we have a fast chip only -- it\u2019s high because the workstation business is really a solutions business and we offer tools and compilers and what we call application acceleration engines like ray tracing engines and scene graphs and shader compilers and they are integrated into design tools and CAD applications all over the world, not just the ones that are available on the open market but the ones that are indigenous to the OEMs themselves.  And so Quadro FX and all of the software that we have developed over the years, of which we make enormous investments, it has assured us a position that is very, very high in that marketplace. We just add a ton of value. It\u2019s not just a graphics chip.  And so when that market recovers and it looks like it is recovering slowly every quarter, the margin leverage is very high.  And lastly, the consumer electronics market is also -- generates royalty payments and such and its gross margins are high too. And so I would attribute our -- most of that to be the gross margin drivers. \nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up, can you talk about the TEGRA business, maybe update us on your expectations for the revenue for TEGRA next calendar year? And then give us a sense for the split of applications you expect, handsets versus the rest of the consumer electronics space? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We have over 50 projects that we are working on at the moment to get shipping and that consists of portable media players, smartphones, what some people call tablets, what some people called pads, Internet television, and automobile. The automobile projects will ramp up starting 2012, in a couple of years. The other projects will ramp up -- we already shipped Zune and Samsung. The portable media players tend to go through shorter certification cycles, as you know. And then the others, you are going to start seeing projects ramping out into the marketplace starting in Q1 and so that\u2019s a very important part of our business and we invested for quite a long time in this area we call mobile computing and we were just certain that some day the vast majority of us are going to demand computing everywhere.  We are going to demand Internet access everywhere and the full web experience whenever we can. And so this is an investment that I think is really, really starting to come home to roost.  We are experiencing our -- we are experiencing as an industry the second personal computing revolution and I think everybody would agree that this is -- this second personal computing revolution will likely be more important and larger than the first one. And so how would I see the near-term revenues? It\u2019s doubling every quarter off of a small base and it is going to be a real -- it\u2019s going to be a significant part of our business in the near-term and as soon as it becomes a sizable part of our business near-term over the next quarter or two, we will break it out and report it separately. But at the moment, it is just growing nicely. \nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much.  \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.\nUche Orji - UBS : Thank you very much. David, let me just ask you about the impact of the extra week in Q4 on the revenue line -- I can see the impact on the expense line but should we assume that it is a linear progression such that it has an impact on the revenue line, just to make sure I can put the guidance in context?\nDavid White: Well, I think the 14th week wasn\u2019t as much of an impact on revenue as much as supply constraints was an impact on it, so the extra week didn\u2019t actually buy us really anything, from a revenue standpoint. \nUche Orji - UBS : Okay, just wanted to clarify that. Jen-Hsun, on professional solutions, I mean, just knowing how important this is for your margins, you said it looks like it is recovering. When you say that, what are the metrics that lead you to conclude that? Is it book to bill? Is it inquiries from customers? And if you can also shed some light as to what end market we are seeing some recovery on the professional solutions, just so we can get a sense as to the sustainability of the growth we saw this last quarter. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Good questions. Two parts -- for our OEM business, most of that business is pulled from hubs, so we just have to monitor the hub pulls. And so whenever they deplete the hubs, we fill the hubs and so monitoring the hub pulls is a good indicator of the business rate and the hub pulls are surely up.  And the second thing is what we call differentiated solutions and there are things like digital video pipeline that we announced at NAB recently, which allows you to stream live video, high definition live video right into a compositor for graphics like you see on TV. We composite the 3D graphics and then we stream that right out into broadcast. That used to require many racks of computers and now we literally do it on using one quadro plex format, one little tiny box. So for a DVP and an SVS, which is our scaleable visual solutions, you know how cheap, how inexpensive flat panel displays have become and so many companies are starting to put multiple flat panel displays into a power wall configuration because of its resolution and productivity capability and also mostly because it has just become so inexpensive.  We created a scaleable visual solution that allows you to span a single application virtually across many, many computers and displays, or put many applications up on that power wall.  And so the thing that we see there is just the traction of the interest there and the design pipeline that is building there. And then starting the end of this coming quarter and the next quarter, we are going into a new product cycle and that new product cycle is based on [FIRMY] and we are going to bring to the market for the first time in history the ability to do raytracing interactively in every single workstation. Customers really ecstatic about that capability and I can't wait to revolutionize graphics again. And so that\u2019s -- the short-term, it\u2019s the pull and the design pipeline, which we track very carefully, and then shortly after that, the ramping of FIRMY GPUs. \nUche Orji - UBS : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Can I just ask one last question, David? Let me just ask you about -- so if I look at the chipset business, moving the mix from more to Intel versus AMD, did that have any impact on ASPs, and by extension did that have any impact on margins? And that\u2019s my last question. \nDavid White: Well, yes, the MCP61, which Jen-Hsun talked about earlier, is a low-end product for us and it does have lower ASPs than the Ion does, obviously and the Ion does have higher margins, so that did help uplift margins, yes. \nUche Orji - UBS : Okay, great. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me just clarify -- MCP61 has lower ASP but higher gross margins. MCP79 has --\nDavid White: -- profit, gross profit. \nJen-Hsun Huang: -- gross profit dollars, right. That\u2019s what you meant, but I just wanted to clarify. \nUche Orji - UBS : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Congrats on the good numbers, Jen-Hsun. Thank you. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: I wanted to ask a question about the supply constraints that you are seeing today, across three different vectors -- one, does it give you, seem to give you better visibility now that you are getting some backlog building up? Two, is there a point at which it is going to cap your ability to grow your sales? And then three, do you think there is any impact to market share because of those constraints?\nJen-Hsun Huang: All good questions. One, I\u2019m about to get visibility all the way through next year, it seems and so yes, when we are this constrained, customers have to work with us really carefully to make sure that their needs are well understood by us. And we are short of those needs. We came out of last quarter several million units short. That\u2019s a lot of PCs. And we came into this quarter several million units short and my expectation is we don\u2019t make it up. So the answer to your number two question is it surely constrains our growth. I think that we should have made -- there is probably an opportunity for us to have done somewhere between $50 million to $100 million more last quarter and certainly this quarter. And so it is certainly constraining our growth.  Is it contributing to -- would it contribute to share loss? Sure. We demonstrated that this quarter. We lost, according to Mercury Research, I think it was two or three points of market share and it was completely attributed to lack of supply. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks and then just as a follow-up, when I think about your business over the next four quarters, even over the next eight quarters, it sounds like we will have a chipset business which peaks in the second half and then goes down. TEGRA, which is growing, workstation which can recover, PCs which are generally recovering -- but I wonder if you can specifically point to revenue growth as attributable to GPU compute specifically. \nJen-Hsun Huang: So let me see if I can break that down a bit -- I expect GeForce to grow next year, not only because the market will be healthier next year. There is real evidence that GPU adoption is increasing. There is -- and the enthusiasm behind FIRMY, our next generation GPU architecture, is just out of this world. I mean, it\u2019s just way over the top. And the reason for that is this is because the first brand new architecture we have created in four years and instead of an incremental change to DX11, this is a fundamentally new architecture and the performance is fabulous. And so we are expecting to be very successful with FIRMY and all of its derivatives.  And so that is one -- the second thing is quadro, my expectation will do much, much better next year than this year by several hundred million dollars.  And number three, TESLA, which is our GPU computing product for super computing and for high performance computing and cloud computing, I believe that is going to be a growth market and there is every evidence that with all of the adoption out in the marketplace and the OEMs finally realizing that this is the architecture of the future, they are all ramping up to build heterogeneous computing or GPU computing based servers, so I expect TESLA to grow.  And then I expect TEGRA to grow a lot next year, and so -- not to mention our core logic. There is a very good bet that it is going to grow next year and obviously it will be our last generation. We will make modifications and adjustments to it and so it is hard to say whether it will ship for two years or two-and-a-half years or three years but surely it will be more than one-and-a-half years. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Jen-Hsun, I just need you to clarify one thing, if you might -- when you say performance of FIRMY is great, are you saying that relative to your previous architecture or also relative to the current competition?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Both. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup: Great, thanks.\nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: A couple of questions -- regarding 40-nanometer, when does the situation get better? How are the yields coming along and what is your allocation from your foundry? Is it something that would allow you to get out of this perhaps earlier than your competition?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The yields are improving. I would say that without exception, yields are better today than it was at the beginning of last quarter. [TSMC] and Moores and his entire management team are just intensely focused on this and they are making progress every single day.  Yield enhancement [inaudible] is NVIDIA's number one strategic objective now. It is all we do. If floods my entire email. That is all I talk about. That is all I think about. That is all we meet about. And so it is of vital interest to both of us that we get 40-nanometer yields up to the levels that are absolutely world class. And I have no question whatsoever that it will and based on the work that -- and the effort that the TSMC team is putting into it, I have every confidence, complete confidence that we will get there, and soon.  Relative to the allocation, you know obviously, I don\u2019t know what other people are allocated -- all I know is this; we\u2019re not allocated enough. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Okay, and then a follow-up -- thanks, Jen-Hsun -- a follow-up on your commentary that you are going to make modifications to your core logic or your MCP89, I suppose. Does that mean you are going to come out with an MCP99 and what would that product look like if it is not DMI based?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well you know, one of the things you can count on with NVIDIA is that we are always really clever and we have to be clever because we are not -- we don\u2019t target the mainstream market. The baseline market is Intel integrated graphics. And it\u2019s kind of like the house brand. You know, when you go to Safeway, it\u2019s kind of like Safeway Select, it\u2019s the house brand.  Our brand is the differentiated brand and when you put GeForce with an Intel processor, you get the differentiated product and that\u2019s our business. It\u2019s differentiation. And we are going to keep working hard to look for ways to architecturally enhance the PC experience and the PC platform so that our OEMs and ultimately the end users would have the benefit of a differentiated platform over the generic baseline Intel integrated graphics. And so that is our strategy and we have not run out of ideas by a long shot. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum from Auriga USA.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Just quickly, and I apologize, I\u2019m in an airport, I missed some of this but did you say that there was any sell-through of previously reserved inventory in the quarter and did that help gross margin at all? And if so, do you plan on selling through -- is there more previously written down inventory which there is a chance of selling through next quarter? And then if the January quarter wasn\u2019t going to be a 14-week quarter, what would revenue guidance have been? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The answer to your first two question is no and no. We shipped everything we had. We shipped everything we had in Q2. We shipped everything we had in Q3 and if our customers were willing to chairs and furniture, I would have shipped that too. So we -- there was just nothing left and we were still short by a few million parts.  In terms of next quarter, our guidance would be exactly the same whether it was a 14 week or a 13 week, and that basically tells you were are completely supply constrained. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: I guess I\u2019m a little bit confused by that because certainly if there is an extra week, then you produce an extra week\u2019s worth of stuff, so if you are selling it as fast as you are producing it, is there not an extra week\u2019s worth of stuff to sell through?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Like I said, it is all supply constrained and if we have more time to build it, we certainly -- we would certainly build more but our demand is sufficiently high and we -- you probably already also know that we can only ship wafers that are outputted from the factor several weeks in advance. And so if you cut one of my weeks short but the wafers came out of TSMC, we would just rush it through the back end and ship it. And so if you cut our quarter down by three weeks, then it will surely affect our output but if you cut it back by a week, we will just increase our back-end capacity and ship more wafers that came out the week before that. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Okay, thanks. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital : Can you talk a little bit about the professional business prospects because I don\u2019t think those are 40-nanometer parts and I assume those are more available and if John Chambers is right, supposedly these enterprise projects should be loosening up as your third quarter numbers show. How much could you grow that professional business in Q4? And I have a quick follow-up after that. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Our PSG business is demand constrained, not supply constrained, so I agree with you there. And so we will ship as much as the market -- we will replenish as much as the market pulls. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital : Okay, that\u2019s good. Jen-Hsun, you showed -- I was at the show when FIRMY was previewed and you showed very good numbers on the computing side. Relative to your competition that is shipping products, you didn\u2019t talk anything about the graphics side -- should I assume that the graphics performance is equally superior to the competition that is shipping right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We didn\u2019t announce anything on graphics because it wasn\u2019t graphics day. When we announce GeForce and Quadro, we are going to talk about the revolutionary graphics ideas that are designed into FIRMY and so we are looking forward to do that in the near future. And so please be patient with us -- the market is anxiously waiting and we have enthusiasts all over the world that are waiting for us to ship it. You know, every four years or so, we revolutionize the GPU with a brand new architecture. If you remember the G80, what became the GeForce 8800, was probably one of the most successful products in the history of our company and we\u2019ve been doing incremental changes to G80 since then.  And now with FIRMY, it\u2019s another revolutionary architecture and I\u2019m expecting to take the GPU market up another notch. And relative to the competition, the market has really spoken -- although it\u2019s a fast chip, it\u2019s not that fast and it is basically an RV770 with DX11. And I think that you could incrementally make changes for a number of years but certainly not forever and we are going to really change the marketplace going forward with FIRMY and so that\u2019s our focus and we are trying to get it shipped as soon as possible. The demand is really, really strong for it and we will tell you about all the great graphics features when we launch. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital : The chip is a very big one. I was wondering, can you shrink it quickly?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, there are many derivatives of FIRMY and so each one of the processors are designed to be the right size of its market. You know, back in the good old days, everybody used to tell me that MP10 was too big and then MP20 was too big and MP40 was too big, MP30 was too big -- it\u2019s only too big if it doesn\u2019t do anything and if it is -- but if the performance is excellent, what consumers enjoy is something that is surprising and delightful and shocking and just the next level. And that is what we have built for them. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital : Thank you very much. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney with FTN Capital.\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : I wanted to try to get into the issue we\u2019ve been hearing about in the market. It\u2019s been noted that your higher end discrete graphics processor, the 270, 285, 290, that line, has been in short supply and we are wondering if you have made a strategic decision to de-emphasize that segment of the market or if you are supply constrained even at 55-nanometer, or if you have just seen demand tail off and that is why we have seen supply slow to a trickle here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the demand for GTX275 and 285 and 295 is really high. We have nothing left. We\u2019ve just got nothing left. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : So this is a supply -- \nJen-Hsun Huang: We shipped everything we could last quarter and we are not trying to keep any for a rainy day and so customers are just yanking parts of our hands and so we are just trying to keep up and our focus is just to keep up with our demand across the board. And the sacrifices that we have to make sometimes in our own channel products, particularly the high end so that we can fulfill OEM demand, is a sacrifice that we have to make and we made plenty of that this quarter and we will have to make some of it next quarter. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, and then if I could, a follow-up circling back to the chipset question, I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly, so your view on chipsets for next year is that you have a competitive advantage in your MPP79 and 89 that delivers graphics that is better than what Intel will even deliver on its Erindale platform and so are you thinking that PC bakers may want to have an NVIDIA chipset even alongside Erindale, or are you thinking that attach rates for discrete graphics will be rising on notebooks and that is how you plan to replace those chipset revenues?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I was just talking about chipsets and it is not -- MCP79 and MCP89 do not connect to Erindales. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : So when Intel switches to Erindale, do you have a substitute or do you just not think that chipset business or the switch to Erindale is going to occur quickly enough to materially affect your chipset business over the next calendar year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It will not switch over quickly enough. The market demand for core 2 duos are still really, really strong because core 2 duo, as you know, is the best CPU that has probably been designed by anybody on the planet in the last 10 years. The core 2 duo is not just fast but it is fast and low power and it is just exquisitely engineered. Core 2 duo is -- \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, so it sounds like -- \nJen-Hsun Huang: -- where it is today, and so core 2 duo is what we connect to -- core 2 duo, Celerons, Pentium Ds, Atoms, so on and so forth -- that is where MCP79 and 89 are targeted. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, I think understand better now. So you are thinking that Intel may not transition as quickly over the next calendar year as they have in the past when they have introduced new chips?\nJen-Hsun Huang: They don\u2019t ever transition as fast as you characterize it. They are transitioning and they transition as fast as they can and some people might want to go to Erindale and some people might want to stay with core 2 duo with an MCP79 and some people might stay with core 2 duo with an MCP89, and then some people might want Atom plus 79 and -- so the market is a big and differentiated place. Everybody doesn\u2019t want to build exactly the same thing. And the benefit of MCP79 and 89 is it allows customers to build different types of devices. The HP mini note that has the Ion chip in it, talk about the recognition that HP is getting. I think it\u2019s the only box from HP that I see reviewed. I don\u2019t remember a Lenovo notebook ever getting reviewed, with the exception of the Ion netbook that they recently shipped.  I think that the market is dying for differentiated type of products and so many OEMs will choose different strategies. I don\u2019t think everybody wants to build exactly the same thing. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, thanks. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : David, I was just wondering if you could give some color with respect to your revenue guidance, what you guided up 2%. Of the businesses, which ones do you think would be up in the January quarter?\nDavid White: Well, we don\u2019t typically break it out separately one business versus another but certainly our GPU business would be up higher if we had more supply available to us than what we have guided. As I think we indicate in our commentary and so forth, our PSB business, we are seeing some positive traction there. We would expect it to be up. So I think our business across most of our platforms will all be up. It is just that they are going to be modest as a result of supply constraints. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Just to get back to the [inaudible] on the guidance and the capacity constraints, which you have had somewhat longer now to address and you have the extra week -- should we construe then that your guidance, given the description of I think Jen-Hsun said very, very strong demand, is conservative, as it was last quarter or how should we think about that? And beyond that, do you have any sense of how we should think about normal seasonality at the beginning of the next year?\nDavid White: If you look at historical quarters and so forth, we have much more turns business generally to generate than what we have in the last few quarters and as we have ramped our products and so forth, we\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve had sufficient inventories in the past, you might say, to respond to some of the ramp that we have seen in the second quarter and the third quarter. But now we are to a point where we are really supply constrained -- I mean, my revenue is going to be determined not so much by our turns business we generate this quarter, it\u2019s not going to be determined so much by the opening backlog we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s really determined by the amount of supply we\u2019ve got available to us and we think we have a clearer picture at least of what that is today and our ability to build against that. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Do you have a framework for how we should think about seasonality for the beginning of next year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Next year is going to be an interesting first quarter because in fact, we will need more wafers than ever in Q1. And the reason for that is because -- and I mean more 40-nanometer wafers than ever in Q1 because we are ramping -- we are obviously fully ramping FIRMY for three different product lines, GeForce, Quadro, and Tesla. We will be fully ramping MCP89. We will be fully ramping TEGRA. Not to mention the 40-nanometer products that we currently have that are fully ramped up, and so I am expecting Q1 to be a pretty exciting quarter for us because we just have so many new products. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : So Jen-Hsun, do you feel it\u2019s going to be a growth quarter or do you think there will be the normal seasonality?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think we have a shot at having a growth quarter but again, it\u2019s going to be completely supply determined. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Just on the expense side where you\u2019ve guided it to 305, David, I think in prior updates you have been saying that you thought that the January period would be more like 270. You have the extra week but what are the other elements that have changed the expense guidance? And also, it looks like you are guiding the gross margin somewhat lower despite higher revenue. Could you talk about what are the elements of the mix that are suggesting that it will be lower?\nDavid White: So let me go to your operating expense question first -- if you look at our operating expenses and the guidance we gave on the quarter, it is really -- the 14th week is a fairly sizable element of the increase from Q3 to Q4. But there are a couple of other pieces that kind of enter into it as well that was listed in the commentary and one of them is the fact that we are in the midst of launching and bringing up a record number of new products right now and those new products each require engineering wafers, they incur expenses for tape outs, they incur expenses for marketing materials and launches and so forth and so all those things combined have our bring-up expenses running at roughly 2X the rate that they were just a couple of quarters ago. That will not be permanent. We would expect that to go down sometime in the second quarter because we will still be bringing up some of these products in the first quarter but we would expect it to come down.  And then the other piece that I think we also indicated is in our legal expense have gone up as well during some of this time period and so those are the primary elements of the bridge but I do believe it will come down in Q1 and I do believe it will come down again in Q2 as we get some of these bring-ups behind us.  Going back to your question as it relates to gross margins, our non-GAAP gross margin -- well, our non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter were 41% and we basically guided 40% to 42%, so I would say we guided flat. I wouldn\u2019t say we guided down. The extra -- \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : I\u2019m sorry, I thought it was the GAAP gross margin that you were guiding at 40 to 42 from the 43 level. \nDavid White: We are guiding flat with the GAAP gross margins and the non-GAAP gross margins would be pretty much the same if you pull out the insurance reimbursement we got. So if you pull out the -- \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : How big was that?\nDavid White: It was $25 million, so if you pull the insurance reimbursement out and whether you look at it on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, it is roughly flat quarter to quarter. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Okay. Just last thing -- \nMichael Hara: Tim, we need to move on to another question. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay.\nAnalyst for Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: This is Robert [Pickover] in for Craig. I guess understanding that demand is strong and the environment with component shortages out there, do you see any risks that the PC supply chain potentially overheated in 3Q due to a Windows 7 build-ahead, possibly spurring any kind of double ordering?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we are really not that close to meeting anybody\u2019s demands, so I am not really too worried about them ordering more. And so I don\u2019t -- I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue at the moment. Everybody is being allocated. I don\u2019t have a single customer who is not being allocated and so that\u2019s the first thing.  The second thing is that our growth is also coming from our professional solutions business, which I expected to grow, continue to grow. Our growth and therefore top line in margins will come from TEGRA, which consumes very little wafers but generates a lot of earnings. And so those two things, between TEGRA, our mobile computing business, and our TESLA server and cloud computing business, and our professionals business, I think we have a shot at growing through it all despite the supply constraints. \nAnalyst for Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And can you guys talk about what you are seeing in terms of pricing within your desktop and notebook GPU products in the quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think as you can imagine, the conversation is really on supply and most of our conversations with our customers are all very emotional and all related to supply. We wish we could give them more. They wish we could get them more and this is a conversation we have with 100% of our customers. There is not a single customers that we have not at some level let down during the quarter and there is not one customer we will not let down in Q4 and we all feel terrible about it and we are beating ourselves up over it and you can tell from my tone that this is something that I am obviously not very happy about. But we are doing everything we can and I know all of our suppliers are doing everything they can. \nAnalyst for Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: And does that imply that you are able to raise prices in this environment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t raise prices. There\u2019s no such thing. I mean, raising prices because demand is high is just bad mojo, man. You don\u2019t want to go there. \nAnalyst for Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.\nAnalyst for Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: This is [Simrin] in for Seth. Thank you for taking my question. I had a couple of quick questions -- the first is on the chipset business. Based on what you said in the call, it seems like you expect that the business could grow in 2010. I know that there are a lot of moving parts here but assuming that you don\u2019t get access to Intel\u2019s new bus, how do you think about revenues over the next few years? Are they expected to gradually roll off or do you expect a cliff in revenues based on transition from one processor family to the other? And the other question is on TEGRA -- previously you have indicated that TEGRA could possibly do close to $100 million per quarter exiting 2010. Based on the wins that you have right now, I just wanted to get an idea of what your visibility is on that sort of revenue number. Thank you. \nMichael Hara: Why don\u2019t we skip the first part of the question, if you will, because we answered that previously at length but I\u2019ll let Jen-Hsun answer the TEGRA part. \nJen-Hsun Huang: The TEGRA question, we have all these different projects in the pipeline and all of these projects are rather engineering intensive. You know, one of the things about the embedded business is that it takes longer to get into, it takes longer to ramp -- we\u2019ve been working on these projects now for -- some for almost a year and these embedded projects take a lot of custom engineering. And the benefit of the embedded business, of course, and the integrated business is that once you get designed in, then you ship for a lot longer and it\u2019s just a very, very different business than the PC industry, which has very rapid turns and very rapid cycles. And so it has some benefits and it has some dis-benefits and I think that long-term, long-term being a year, this is going to be just a spectacular business. I think that TEGRA is one of -- we are one of two or three companies that is at the epicenter and the strike zone of mobile computing and I think that -- I don\u2019t know how many companies wouldn\u2019t want to be in our position with the TEGRA processor right now but it is just right down the middle of where the most important areas of innovation and where the most exciting areas of computing is happening right now, so I can't be more pleased. We just have to be patient. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Michael. Please go ahead. \nMichael Hara: Thanks, everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter."}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2010, "date": "2009-08-06 23:38:10", "content": "Executives: Michael Hara - Investor Relations Jen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director David White - Chief Financial Officer \nAnalysts: Rick Schaeffer - Oppenheimer  Craig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay Tim Luke - Barclays Capital  Joanne Feeney - FTN Capital  Patrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan  Suji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers David Wu - Global Crown Capital  Shawn Webster - J.P.

With that, I will turn the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report revenue of $777 million, representing sequential growth of 17% from Q1. We reported a GAAP net loss of $0.19, which included an additional net charge of approximately $119 million to cover costs related to the die packaging material set issue which we previously disclosed in July 2008.  Although the number of systems impacted by this remains consistent with our initial estimates, the costs of remediation and repair has been higher than originally anticipated.  Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes the additional charge and stock-based compensation, was 36.3%, an improvement of 560 basis points over last quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $0.07 per share. We reduced inventory by another $48 million, which now stands at 51 days on a non-GAAP basis. We made good progress managing down operating expenses through efficiency projects. I also want to acknowledge the sacrifices NVIDIA employees are making so that our company can continue to invest in the important initiatives that we are passionate about.  Strategically, we are focused on two major game changing ideas. First, computing is evolving from central processing on the CPU to co-processing on the CPU and GPU. To enable this new computing paradigm, we invented the CUDA parallel computing architecture that is now shipping in over 100 million GeForce ion quadro and Tesla GPUs, representing a significant installed base for application developers.  After three years of evangelizing, GPU computing has surely reached the tipping point. CUDA has been adopted in a wide range of applications. In consumer applications, nearly every major consumer video application has been or will be accelerated by CUDA. We estimate there are over 1200 research papers based on CUDA. We\u2019ve highlighted 500 of them on CUDAZone.com.  CUDA now accelerates Amber, an important molecular dynamic simulation program used by more than 60,000 researchers in academia and pharmaceutical companies worldwide to accelerate new drug discovery. CUDA sped up Amber 50 times.  For the financial market, numerics and compatible announced CUDA support for their new counter party risk application and achieved an 18 times speed-up. Numerics is used by approximately 375 financial institutions.  There are broad ranging uses for CUDA including astro physics, computational biology and chemistry, fluid dynamic simulation, electromagnetic interference, CT [image reconstruction], seismic analysis, raytracing and more.  Another indicator of CUDA adoption is the ramp of our new TESLA GPU for computing business. There are now more than 700 GPU clusters installed around the world with new Fortune 500 customers ranging from Schlumberger and Chevron in the energy sector to BNP Paribas in banking.  And starting this fall with the launch of Microsoft\u2019s Windows 7 and Apple\u2019s Snow Leopard, GPU computing will go mainstream. In these new operating systems, the GPU will not only be the graphics processor but also a general purpose parallel processor accessible to any application.  Our second major initiative is mobile and embedded computing. It is increasingly clear that the combination of rich applications on the Internet and ultra low power computing technology will trigger the next computing revolution. Rich applications on the Internet can be connected to tiny yet powerful computers to enable amazing new experiences. Apple\u2019s iPhone, the poster child of such an experience, has revolutionized the phone as we know it. The Amazon Kindle has revolutionized how we enjoy books.  These are surly the first of many devices to be created that will require small form factor, energy efficient yet powerful processors. Some call this cloud computing, some call it web 2.0 but all agree it will revolutionize nearly every industry.  We created TEGRA to enable the next generation of these connected devices, one that will deliver the full high definition Internet connected experience. TEGRA is the industry\u2019s first ultra low power HD processor. TEGRA has been chosen for many next generation smartphones, smartbooks, smartpads, media players, TVs, and cars.  Let me now comment on each of our four businesses -- GeForce and Ion, Quadro, TESLA, and TEGRA.  GeForce and Ion overall grew a combined 11% quarter to quarter. GeForce offers unique capabilities that will define the next generation visual computing experiences like CUDA, which makes video and imaging applications like Cyberlink Motion DSP and Nero many times better. We estimate there are hundreds of millions of users of these applications to create, enhance, and enjoy movies from sharing videos to Facebook to transferring TV shows onto their mobile devices to be enjoyed later. With CUDA, video is the new killer consumer application for the GPU.  Second, PhsyX is a CUDA software engine that does physical world simulation and brings a new level of dynamics to games. Just today [inaudible] highly anticipated Batman Arkham Asylum announced support for PhsyX.  And then there is 3D Vision Stereo -- is quickly becoming the next big thing. From games to movies to photography, there is a groundswell of activity that will burst into the scenes in the near future.  We have announced 26 Ion designs to date. We currently have 9 Ion designs shipping with 17 more in Q3 and Q4. Ion is about bringing great visual experience to even the smallest, lowest power and most affordable PCs. The market wants a great experience on all PCs, irrespective of size or price. We have an exciting Ion roadmap and we look forward to announcing it when ready.  The GPU computing revolution has reached a tipping point. With the new operating systems, the GPU will be a general purpose parallel processor for any application. In Windows 7, GPU computing interface is called Direct Compute and OpenCL for OS10 Snow Leopard. And although the upcoming CPUs and chipsets may include integrated graphics, these graphics controllers lack the general purpose parallel processing capabilities needed by the new operating systems.  Recently John Petty, a leading industry analyst, forecast the global graphics market to grow nearly 22% in 2010, based in part to the rise of the GPU as a co-processor. The report states the continued expansion and development of heterogeneous computing and GPU compute will stimulate growth in 2010, enabled by Apple\u2019s and Microsoft\u2019s new operating system, new programming capabilities using OpenCL, Direct Compute, and NVIDIA's CUDA architecture will remove barriers to the exploitation of the GPU as a serious economical and powerful co-processor in all levels of PCs.  Quadro is our professional visualization solution and the standard for professional designers and creators. Revenue which has declined nearly 40% due to the broader economy affecting the automotive and other industries, was essentially flat from Q1 and appears to have reached bottom. Irrespective of current demand, we continue to innovate amazing new capabilities. This week we announced Axe, or Application Acceleration Engines.  Our suite of GPU accelerated software engines that are vital to software companies all over the world including Autodesk, [Desso], and RTT to name a few. AXE includes PhsyX for accurate physics simulation used in CAD to simulate contact of physical objects, a multi-GPU rendering engine and tools for managing large data sets.  One of the most exciting AXE engines is Optics, the world\u2019s first interactive raytracing engine used to generate photorealistic images. For the first time, designers can study and interact with a photorealistic rendering of their design. Optics is a must see to believe new visualization capability. We are currently engaged with 40 beta sites that are actively using our Optics raytracing module. When deployed, each Optics application will be powered by rendering servers with CUDA GPUs.  This week we also announced Quadroplex SVS, a plug-and-play solution for scaleable visualization. Quadro SVS will revolutionize the way professionals interact with 3D models and analyze large volumes of data in fields such as energy exploration, architectural design, medical research, and consumer packaged goods.  Any application can be distributed seamlessly to run on over four GPUs and displayed across eight displays to create an astounding 32 million pixels of resolution. We estimate that the total addressable market for Quadroplex SVS is approximately $100 million per year, growing at 10% to 20% per year.  TESLA is the industry\u2019s first GPU for high performance computing. The TESLA solution consists of compilers, tools, libraries, as well as the largest team of parallel computing experts to assist in software development.  TESLA is available as a module, a desk side personal super-computer or server for high performance computing clusters. TESLA achieved its first significant quarter of revenue with approximately $10 million in sales. Virtually every major OEM, including [Cray], Dell, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Silicon Graphics, or excuse me, SGI, Sun, and Super Micro now offers TESLA based solutions.  TESLA computing servers are installed in over 700 sites around the world. This quarter we supplied our largest single cluster to date with over 4,000 GPUs. To put this into context, this cluster would be the 12th fastest super computer on the top 500 list.  We have over 50 HPC specialized VARS currently selling TESLA today. We estimate there are approximately 1,000 VARS actively involved in the HPC market which we have yet to engage.  We estimate TESLA to address a $5 billion market opportunity for us over the next three years.  TEGRA is our mobile and embedded processor. We are very excited that our first TEGRA project has entered production. As reported in the press, TEGRA is the processor at the heart of Microsoft\u2019s new Zune HD. There are many more innovative devices in the works. There are 50 active TEGRA designs and many more in evaluation, currently ranging from smartphones and media players, 35 smartbooks and mobile Internet devices, and a growing number of embedded designs for IPTVs and cars.  We estimate that TEGRA will address a $4.5 billion market by 2010 and position us at the epicenter of the next personal computing revolution.  Let me now hand it over to David to discuss our financial details. \nDavid White: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. As Jen-Hsun indicated in his opening comments, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 was $776.5 million, up 17% from $664 million in the prior quarter and also higher than our estimate of up 5% sequentially.  Our second quarter has historically been a seasonally weak quarter for the industry, so we are pleased with our quarter over quarter growth.  We reported a GAAP net loss of $105.3 million, or $0.19 per share. This included additional net charge of $119 million to cover costs related to a weak die packaging material set that was previously identified and used in certain versions of our previous generation chips. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $0.37 per share in the prior quarter, which included a one-time charge of $140 million associated with a cash tender offer for the purchase of certain employee stock options.  Excluding this $119 million net charge, as well as stock-based related compensation, we reported non-GAAP net income for the quarter of $37.7 million, or $0.07 per share. This compares with a $0.09 non-GAAP net loss per share in the prior quarter.  Let me now turn to our individual businesses -- our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory -- represented 48% of our total revenue. In absolute dollars, it was up 5% quarter over quarter. The desktop segment of our GPU business was also up approximately 5% quarter over quarter with continued strength across almost all GeForce product lines, particularly in the higher end performance and enthusiast segments.  The proportion of our desktop revenue sold into the channel was consistent with last quarter with channel inventories remaining at approximately one month\u2019s supply on hand.  The notebook segment of our GPU business was down approximately 5% quarter over quarter. We lost some share in Q2 as the commercial Montevino refresh platform ramped. We expect to regain share as we ramp into the fall platform with our new 40-nanometer GPUs that are in full volume shipments.  Our MCP business, which represented 31% of our total revenue during the quarter, was up approximately 27% quarter over quarter. Consistent with our first quarter, demand was primarily driven by our chipset products designed for the mainstream AMD integrated desktop segment, which was up 55%. It was also driven by chipset products designed for the Intel-based notebook segment, including Ion, which was up 33%.  Revenue for our professional business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, represented 15% of total revenue and was up 10% quarter over quarter. Substantially all of this increase was attributable to TESLA.  As for Quadro, corporate demand, which comprised a substantial percentage of this business, appears to have bottomed at the levels we are currently at with signs that we may be in the early stages of an economic recovery.  Our consumer products business, which includes TEGRA as well as embedded entertainment, represented 6% of our total revenue. It was up in absolute dollar terms almost three-fold quarter over quarter. TEGRA and game consoles both saw significant increases.  Looking at the business as a whole, GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 20.2%. Excluding the net charges associated with the weak material die set, as well as stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 36.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin exceeded our estimates as a result of several factors.  First, we experienced better 55-nanometer yields during the quarter and our mix of 55-nanometer revenue also improved.  Secondly, our consumer business, which carries higher margins because it includes royalties from game consoles, was up as demand resumed on the consumption of excess consumer channel inventories in the first quarter.  And finally, margin in our MCP business was also up as a result of more favorable product mix.  GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $267 million. That\u2019s down $25 million from the previous quarter when you exclude the one-time charge for the stock option tender offer. This quarter-over-quarter reduction was primarily related to lower stock compensation expense resulting from the stock option tender offer we completed in Q1, the full quarter effect of wage reductions implemented in Q1, and lower legal expenses related to ongoing litigation, as well as numerous other cost reduction initiatives we have undertaken to improve the efficiencies of our operations.  NVIDIA's worldwide employment at the end of the second quarter stood at 5,506, essentially flat from the first quarter.  Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $352 million, which equated to a DSO of approximately 41 days, an improvement of 1 day from the prior quarter.  Inventories at the end of the quarter were $279 million, down $48 million, or 15% quarter over quarter. Inventory days at quarter end were 51. This compares with 64 days at the end of the first quarter and 144 days at the end of the fourth quarter.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to approximately $49 million, down slightly from $51 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $18 million, which as a result of cost reduction efforts were down slightly from the $21 million we spent in the prior quarter.  Accounts payable at the end of the quarter were $276 million, up approximately $50 million from the prior quarter, driven largely by our higher volumes. And our free cash flow for the second quarter was a positive $117 million.  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.47 billion, up approximately $128 million from the first quarter, with the principal contributors being cash earnings and lower inventories.  In closing, let me briefly comment on our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% from the second quarter. As for gross margin, we expect GAAP gross margin to increase in the range of 36% to 38%. The primary factors for this improvement are lower overall costs, 40-nanometer volumes, and form higher gross margin products like TESLA and TEGRA as they continue to ramp.  We expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million. This is up from the prior quarter as a result of increased tape-out and prototype activity, as well as increased litigation expenses. \n :  Diluted shares for the third quarter are expected to be in the range of 565 million to 570 million.  This concludes our formal remarks. At this time, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Operator. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rick Schaeffer with Oppenheimer.\nRick Schaeffer - Oppenheimer : Nice quarter. I have a couple of questions -- just one real quick, could you give us a little more like maybe incremental color on the $119 million charge? Maybe your confidence level that this sort of puts the [bump metal] issue to rest and if so, do you think this is going to make it easier for you guys to win notebook business, retake share going into the back half of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Rick, if you go back a year ago when the company first recognized this issue and we recorded a charge in the second quarter same time a year ago, that was based upon an estimate at that time that -- it included a number of factors that the company had to estimate and didn\u2019t have a lot of data on it at that point. At that point, we only had one OEM customer that we entered into negotiations with but here we stand a year later and we\u2019ve substantially negotiated agreements with almost all of the affected OEMs. We have more specific information as it relates to what the repair costs will be, not only our customers but other parties that are part of the ecosystem for supplying those products. So today we feel much more confident about our estimate, the range around that estimate. It is still an estimate. I won't say it will never change but we feel pretty good about the data we have today and our ability to estimate it at this point.  As it relates to the second part of your question, if you look at the people that are focused on the [bump crack] issue, it\u2019s really a small, very small portion of the company. The company -- the vast majority of the company are really focusing on the future of our business with very little distraction by [bump crack]. Certainly it\u2019s a distraction for some of our customers and so forth. It really isn\u2019t impacting the company or our ability to launch new products and for those products to be accepted in the marketplace. \nRick Schaeffer - Oppenheimer : So it really hasn\u2019t been much of a headwind for you the last quarter, I guess?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No. \nRick Schaeffer - Oppenheimer : Okay. And then just a follow-up -- could you quantify maybe how much of the second quarter gross margin improvement was related to better mix within GPU, you know, give us a number maybe? And also as part of that, how do you guys look at your market share in discrete going forward? I mean, are you guys sort of more focused on improving gross margin in the back half of the year there or do you expect to see sort of continued pricing pressure as you try to increase share there?\nDavid White: So on your first question as it relates to GPU margins, you know, we -- as I indicated in my comments, we have a number of products that cut across a number of different process nodes and this quarter, we were able to move more of our business into the 55-nanometer process node, so that changed the mix. And probably overall, it was at least a point you might say in the improvement we saw quarter over quarter. \nJen-Hsun Huang: And as we ramp up, Rick, as we ramp up our other businesses like TESLA and TEGRA, which are inherently higher gross margin products, our gross margin is going to continue to improve but the major factor is as you recall, several quarters ago we had nearly 150 days worth of inventory and a lot of that inventory was in 65-nanometer and the company has been really focused on making sure that we work through that 65-nanometer inventory and now we by and large worked through it and as we are now ramping aggressively 55- and 40-nanometer products and they are all fresh products, the gross margins are going to be much, much better with that.  Related to increasing margins or increasing share, the answer is yes on both. I mean, we believe we can increase margins by driving efficiency in our company and even though the velocity of this -- of the GPU business is incredibly high, we believe that extraordinary excellence can improve margins and you\u2019ve seen us do that before.  And on the other hand, we can increase the premium of our products in the marketplace above where it is today. Almost every single segment, there\u2019s a premium on our product and yet we continue to capture a very significant part of the market share and the reason for that is because our products have a much better reputation and it\u2019s always -- it\u2019s had a history of delivering wonderful experiences and this is a much more desirable brand. And so we focus on making sure that the GeForce brand comes with it unique capabilities that other people don\u2019t offer beyond just your basic graphics chip. And so you know that GeForce has the parallel computing capability called CUDA. It has PhsyX processing so that games could be much more dynamic and beautiful, and also this 3D vision investment that we are making that we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s going to turn into a watershed event towards the end of the year [and over to the next]. And this is -- you know that the entire film industry is moving towards stereovision and everybody is looking for ways to bring that capability or that experience to the home. And 3D vision is a pioneer in that space and from a technology investment perspective, we\u2019re just miles and miles ahead.  And so these kinds of innovative ideas are going to continue to help us drive our value in the marketplace and yet still grow our share. \nRick Schaeffer - Oppenheimer : Great, thanks. Congrats, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay.\nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Thanks for taking the question. Nice job on the results. Can you talk about what you are seeing out there on the attach rates for discrete GPUs today in this recessionary environment and where they might be going over the next year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019ve not noticed a shift, if you will, in attach rates per se. We know we have stronger attach rates in certain segments of the market than others for good reasons. For example, you heard in the comments that channel inventory is low. We keep our eyes on channel inventory because a vast majority of our discrete GPUs come from the channel, so although only 50% or maybe 40% of the world\u2019s PCs come from tier two providers, system builders, and channel integrators. The vast majority of the discrete GPUs come from those 40% and the reason for that is because the system builders and the system integrators rely on NVIDIA's brand and the additional capabilities that our chip provides, our processor provides, to offset the tier one brands that they compete against, whereas the tier ones tend to focus on the benefits of their own brand and utilize lower cost components related to, in this particular case, integrated graphics.  So our attach has historically been higher in system builders than the OEMs anyhow but -- and that really -- hasn\u2019t really shifted or changed for our perspective. And going forward, I think that all of the road signs are starting to become more clear. We\u2019ve been evangelizing this idea called GPU computing for some time and it\u2019s a very logical and common-sensical idea that they have to use the right tool or the right processor for the right job. And programs, modern applications today have a lot of instruction parallel parts of the software program but there\u2019s an enormous amount of data parallel parts of the program. And in the data parallel processor part of it, which could have been 3D graphics which we offloaded immediately and historically onto the GPU, but increasingly it\u2019s related to video and images and search and those kind of -- types of applications, in which case we created a parallel processor, a general purpose architecture called CUDA so that applications can offload that.  And so you are now starting to see more and more people talk about GPU computing. In fact, I think that there\u2019s almost no one that I know of in the computer industry who would tell you now that GPU computing or in general called heterogeneous computing is not the future of the computer architecture from industry analysts to Microsoft to Apple Computer -- you know, almost anyone who is developing the future of the computer architecture will openly admit that heterogeneous computing is finally here and it\u2019s the right approach going forward. \nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: As a follow-up, can you guys talk about where you are at with 40-nanometer? What portion of your output it might be over the next six -- you know, over the next couple of quarters and what the gross margin impacts there are as you pay more for wafers and potentially get more die per wafer? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think the general buzz around the industry is that we are by far the largest producers of 40-nanometer today and I think that that\u2019s probably consistent. We have shipped more and earlier than just about anybody, and we haven\u2019t spoken a lot about our 40-nanometer products because we have fabulous products that we are currently shipping and so we tend not to pre-announce products until the customers are really shipping themselves, and so we are ramping our 40-nanometer product now. By Q4, it will represent a very large portion of our revenue. It certainly won't represent the vast majority of it.  Early next year I think it will continue to grow and my expectation is by about the Q3 timeframe, it will represent the vast majority of our products -- Q3 time for next year. \nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: What\u2019s the gross margin impact on 40-nanometer versus 55?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our gross margins are higher on 40-nanometer products because they are fresher products and the die sizes are lower, are smaller and so they tend to be -- they tend to be more cost effective for us. \nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital.\nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Thank you. David, as you look forward and you have obviously seen a significant progression in the gross margin in the July quarter and you are guiding for it to be up again in October, how do you see this moving into the fourth quarter and next year? Should we think about you having the potential as you move to more 40-nanometer to be able to continue this upward trajectory by 100 basis points for the next few quarters, or how should we think about that? And at the same time, could you give us some feel for how we should plan and think about your OpEx going forward as you -- can you hold this 280 level or should we think about it beginning to grow now as the revenue begins to come back? Thank you. \nDavid White: On the gross margin outlook, there\u2019s probably three or so significant pieces of our strategy going forward to increase that. Certainly as you mentioned the 40-nanometer ramp will be an important element of that as Jen-Hsun just commented on a second ago.  The second will be the ramp of TEGRA and TESLA, which are both relatively two new platforms for the company, as they become a larger piece of our mix, their margins today and we expect to continue to be above what our corporate average is and so they will tend to lift the overall margins for the company.  Quadro at the same time carries higher margins than the aggregate for the company and so as the economic climate of our economy and so forth rebounds and as those two products, TESLA and TEGRA ramp, our overall mix is going to be very favorably impacted in our favor.  So we should see our margins continue to improve over the foreseeable -- you know, next four quarters or so. Will there necessarily be hiccups in the way? No one can guarantee that there won't be but clearly those are the important elements of our strategy and as they get executed on and we think that our [inaudible] will continue to make progress.  On the operating expense side, we\u2019ve indicated previously that our objectives were to get our total operating expense down in the $265 million-ish range. Today we ended roughly at that level but in our guidance, we obviously said it was going to go back up and so when you look at some of the reasons for that going back up, they are dictated by some of the litigation expenses that are going on which clearly won't go on forever. It\u2019s dictated by a convergence of a number of new products offerings that are all happening at the same time which obviously increased some of our expenses in the current quarter.  So I think we will continue to see expenses to come down from the 280 level but it will probably just be a little bit slower than what we initially anticipated it would be. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Just two quick follow-ups -- [Quadro] was up a lot. Could you give us a feel for what piece of that is beginning to be TEGRA and how should we think about that for the calendar fourth quarter? And then it looked like workstation was fairly flattish. Is it beginning to show some improvement in the quarter market in workstation? Should we begin to anticipate that for the second calendar half of the year? And maybe Jen-Hsun, with the introduction of Windows 7, how have you seen that or not impacting the market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I will just take a couple of pieces of that. I think they are in general related to gross margin and such. Our Quadro business appears to have normalized or stabilized and certainly the feeling that we are getting from our enterprise customers reflects what other people are seeing out in the marketplace, that the general economy appears to have stabilized some an that the automobile industry, which is a very large consumer of workstations appears to be in better health.  There are other growth markets now for the workstation market. Medical imaging is a very large part of it. Medical is -- and medical research benefits a great deal from a lot of recent attention.  We also aren\u2019t just waiting for the overall economy to come back, as I\u2019ve discussed earlier. We are creating new products that allow people to do new things that weren\u2019t possible before. This Optics raytracing engine, real-time raytracing engine that runs on CUDA GPUs is really a groundbreaking idea, is a groundbreaking capability. We have 40 beta sites going there and when they deploy, they deploy in relatively large configurations because it\u2019s -- the type of models or the visualization task is quite significant. And those could -- those 40 beta sites are just as many as we can support. You know, the number of companies out there who would like to accelerate their time to market through better visualization of their designs is -- well, you could imagine how many that would be. It literally would be every single company in the world would like to do that.  And so this is something that is of great importance and we\u2019re driving that pretty hard.  We also know that high resolution displays and projectors are becoming more affordable than ever. The Sony 4K projectors, digital projectors are very affordable and people need scalable resolution, scalable visualization solutions to be able to address that and so we created a new product called Quadro SVS. And the Quadro SVS virtualizes both the application as well as the display, so you could literally run one application across up to four GPUs completely virtualized and invisibly, and then you can take the output of that and literally drive it up to 32 million pixels without the application ever knowing anything about it. And so this virtualization technology both at the GPU level as well as the display level is a groundbreaking idea and it\u2019s something that we are really excited about.  So we\u2019re going to try to -- we believe that innovation drives growth and we can drive growth irrespective of the economy but the economy certainly has stabilized. So that\u2019s certainly a very important part of our growth factors.  In terms of TESLA, the computing market is a multi-billion dollar market. The reason why TESLA has been adopted by literally every single computer company in the world is because they see the same opportunity we see. People are evaluating and developing software now for TESLA for broad deployment all over the globe and people are looking for ways to improve their computational horsepower per dollar to reduce cost or more importantly to reduce power. TESLA servers consumers nearly 20 times less power than a conventional CPU server and the reason for that is because of the amount of performance that you get out of it.  You know, when I said earlier doing the right job with the right tool, it\u2019s an efficiency statement. If you do that, you will reduce power, you will reduce cost, and you will get things done faster.  And so I think TESLA is going to be a very important growth driver for us as well for next year.  And then on Windows 7, Windows 7 is -- my expectation is that the adoption of GPUs will go up and the adoption of GPUs will go up because very simply that if the operating system allows applications to take advantage of the parallel processor in your PC, they will take advantage of it and when they take advantage of it, the GPU is the right answer. \nTim Luke - Barclays Capital : Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Feeney with FTN Capital.\nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Good afternoon. A question following up on the last one, actually -- so in terms of the value of the GPU for Windows 7 and others that will take advantage of that, what are you guys thinking, what are you assuming about the future of attach rates or of the chipset business once Intel starts to deploy their [Capella] which combines the CPU and the GPU?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, in fact, Joanne, thanks for that question. It\u2019s probably the greatest opportunity I have seen in the GPU business in the last 10 years. And the reason for that is because, and we\u2019ve said this as a high level theme for some time, it just had to play out.  You know, the challenge of integrating graphics into a chipset or into a CPU that has very long design cycles is that by definition, you\u2019ll have to integrate many year old technology into a single chip. And this GPU computing idea that we\u2019ve been evangelizing for three years, some companies really, really didn\u2019t believe it. They really believed in central processing. And as a result of that, they under-invested in the graphics technology that goes into these Capellas and future CPUs with integrated graphics.  And so Windows 7 has direct compute. OS 10 has OpenCL. Linux and others have CUDA. And people are developing parallel computing applications all over the world. You see it, we see it, and every OEM sees it and so the only way to really accelerate or even do a reasonable job at those applications is to add a GPU next to it.  So it doesn\u2019t really matter where the display comes from. The display just drives the monitor. The basic 2D graphics or the basic 3D graphics just drives the monitor. The parallel processing, the programmable shading and all of those other things will come from another processor and we just call that processor the GPU.  So I think the adoption is in fact going to be quite high when the CPUs integrate basic graphics that are not good enough for the modern operating systems. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, so what would we have to assume, or what are you guys assuming the attach rate would have to rise to in order to offset the potential loss of the basic chipset business? What kind of attach rates do you envision arising over the next year or so?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we don\u2019t actually expect much loss in our chipset business next year. We have quite a few exciting projects that we are still working on and people are pushing us really hard to get more chipsets done. So we\u2019re not expecting the decline of it but we are expecting adoption to increase for GPUs next year. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay. Can you comment at all -- probably not, but can you address at all the issue of the legal dispute over the way you can in the future connect your chipset to the system with Intel arguing that you don\u2019t have this particular license that you need?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, you didn\u2019t say -- in your question about chipsets, you didn\u2019t ask specifically about the future and neither did I comment about that and so it\u2019s not related -- it\u2019s just not related.  We\u2019re not -- let me just -- we\u2019re not necessarily building chipsets for future Intel buses. We\u2019ve not commented anything on that and so you are just going to have to wait to see what we come up with and I think that, Joanna, you\u2019ve known us for quite a long time now and the one thing that you can probably say about our company is we are pretty darn clever. There is a lot of ways to skin the cat and we are going to show you more ways to skin the cat than you can shake at and so you just have to wait.  Unfortunately, I can't give you the punch line and you just have to wait for the big surprise. \nJoanne Feeney - FTN Capital : Okay, we\u2019ll wait. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Wedbush Morgan.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Thanks for the question and great job on the quarter. First, just on MCP for chipset, I know that you guys had some good -- some positive trends for AMD based chipsets there and then Ion, I was just hoping you could talk in a little bit more detail about how we should think about those kind of going forward to the next quarter or two. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we have Ion projects that are still coming to market and ramping into production, so my sense is that Ion will still be a growth business for us and so we are going to have to just wait and see how the market adoptions are. We have quite a few projects that we are still ramping.  The chipset business, the definition of a chipset is just a companion processor or a companion chip to the CPU and we have a lot of companion chips to the CPU that enhances the overall experience.  You know, our focus is really very simple -- to enhance the computing experience over the baseline capabilities that Intel or AMD provides, and so if I generalized a statement like that, the smart people will come up with all kinds of great ideas and we have some really exciting things that we are doing for next year. \nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Okay, but if we think about -- you know, I mean, you guys have clearly seen strong orders just on some of the AMD based shipments into Asia, I mean, is that something that we should expect to kind of continue or is that -- or is Ion going to be able to more than offset that type of decline?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It\u2019s actually kind of interesting -- in a way, we only do well on AMD chipsets when AMD\u2019s low-end CPUs or mainstream CPUs do well. And so our -- part of that question, part of the answer for that question depends on how well AMD does. And so we are rooting for them and we\u2019d like them to do well.  On the other hand, we have Ion processors that are companions to Intel CPUs and so we are rooting for them too. And so we are just rooting for everybody. \nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Okay, no, that\u2019s helpful. And then just two quick ones here -- you know, there\u2019s been a lot of concern about desktop pricing intensifying in the back half of the year here -- just curious what -- how you are thinking about that, what\u2019s your sense in terms of how that is going to track and potentially the impact to margins?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we are always going to compete for the business out there and we follow two basic, maybe three basic rules -- one is that we always look for ways to innovate. The competition has a basic graphics chip and they\u2019ll sell it at the lowest possible price to gain share. We will tend to take a slightly different strategy all the time. We are always looking to innovate and create new value that we can bring to the users and in exchange hope that they would reward us with a higher premium. The GeForce brand across the board has a higher premium almost at every single segment and we hope that they will recognize the benefits of the work that we\u2019ve done with 3D stereo and CUDA and PhsyX so that they will continue to reward us for the value that we bring.  On the other hand, we\u2019ll fight hard for business and we\u2019ve had to be competitive out there and we are realistic about market conditions and we are realistic about the competition and so we\u2019ll continue to fight for our business.  And then the last lever is continue to drive costs down in our company and do the things that are in the control of our company to improve our margins. \nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: I see. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a last one, I was hoping you could -- \nMichael Hara: Patrick, we have guys waiting, can we move on to the next one?\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Morgan: Okay, great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva with Kaufman Brothers.\nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Nice job on the quarter. On the professional segment, you guys gave a sense that the orders were ones that were kind of embargoed for a while and are now coming back or there\u2019s new business -- is there any sense of that talking to the sales folks?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Suji, what does embargoed mean?\nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: I just mean they put them off, basically because of the economic downturn and they were delayed until now. Is that the sense of where these orders are coming from?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It must be. It\u2019s got to be. My sense is that the requirement for design tools to create products to solve problems in research to discover new signs, you know, I think that those -- the demand didn\u2019t perish. I\u2019m certain we didn\u2019t lose any market share and so it must be because demand was held up, our spending was held up because of cost containment reasons.  We are starting to feel the benefits and some of the early signs of the stimulus program kicking in, and so I think whether it\u2019s in industry or in science, in the academia, we are starting to feel much, much more positive energy relating to upgrades and new machines.  But we are also, like I said earlier, we are going to innovate our way out of it either way and if the market comes back, we\u2019ll just get the double whammy and I can't wait until Quadro goes back to our historical levels of $200 million, $250 million a quarter. And if we add that, add to that all of the new capabilities that we are creating, as well as TESLA, I think our enterprise business could be really, really significant and so -- but we are just going to focus on innovation and when the purchasing power comes back, they are going to have a lot of new things to buy. \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: One other quick question, Jen-Hsun -- the Montevino share that you lost and now you are recapturing, can you kind of remind us of the dynamics of that share shift and why you think that won't necessarily recur going forward? Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the notebook business is very competitive and it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things and I forget exactly what the reason was when we lost some share. Sometimes we don\u2019t have the appetite to go for the prices that are needed to win, sometimes the competition just has a better offering, or sometimes the competition is already designed in and so it was just easier to transition to the new platform.  So there\u2019s a variety of different reasons that -- and there\u2019s only one way to win and about 10,000 ways to lose, and so looking forward, we know what sockets we\u2019ve already won and the ramp of 40-nanometers will play a big role and hopefully we come back, and so we are looking forward to that.  And then going forward, we just have to invent new ideas and new capabilities that really delight our customers and break new ground, and we\u2019ll win [inaudible] as a result of that. \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about your guidance in terms of revenues? I know you had some pretty good seasonal demand, better than seasonal demand in Q2 but Q3 it happens to be your -- if I recall, the seasonally best quarter of the year and with 40-nanometer based products coming on-stream, why would the sequential growth be such low levels, admittedly from a higher base for FY -- the first quarter of this fiscal year? And I have a quick question, follow-on, too. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think we -- we\u2019re not particularly -- we don\u2019t have any particular better insight into the economy than you do but I think that the notion of seasonality really needs to be challenged or reset with the new economy. Thinking about the previous season and these seasons, just it makes no sense. It\u2019s a new world out there now and so we are just looking at business every single day and we guide to what we think is the most prudent and the best of our ability and it is what it is. Compared to what some other companies have guided, it appears to be quite good and so we\u2019re just going to have to play it out and see how it turns out. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Okay. This week has been a Siggraph week and I understand that our friends at Intel have been talking about Larabie. Are there any things that they have revealed to the world I guess this week that is a meaningful surprise or departure from what your understanding was prior to Siggraph this week?\nJen-Hsun Huang: This is the third Siggraph that they\u2019ve talked about Larabie and we paid attention to the last two. I have to admit that I didn\u2019t pay much attention this time. Not because I don\u2019t care -- we were just really busy. So if you hear anything, let me know but I\u2019ve not heard anything from the grapevines.  The important thing is that they -- they now recognize that parallel computing is too important not to invest in and it\u2019s also clear that parallel computing is very hard otherwise they would have taken so long to build it. And to efficiently auto parallelize applications and make it easy for programmers to achieve the level of parallelism that is inherently possible in the silicon is really, really hard work and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve spent the last 15 years of our company and for many of us, many of the industry, many of the experts in our company, some 30 years of their careers working on this problem. And so it\u2019s not something that just because somebody wants to throw a bunch of CPUs together is going to make it happen, and so I think one, they recognize the importance of it; two, it apparently is very hard; and then three, I can\u2019t wait to see Larabie like anybody else. After all this talk, I\u2019m just dying to see it and so when I see it, you\u2019ll be the first to know. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Just one quick -- I\u2019ll sneak one quick one in; what is the tax rate we should be using for this, the rest of this fiscal year or next year? On a pro forma basis?\nDavid White: Probably for this year somewhere in the 4% or 5% range. Next year, well, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess depending on what happens with tax legislation but I think it would still be in the 10% type of range. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the -- I guess the overall demand environment, you laid some context that the economy is still a little bit uncertain. That kind of colored your outlook for Q3 but based on your order trends, what segments do you think will be the strongest and the weakest? And can you give us some flavor on what units and pricing for your GPU business did during the quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019ll let David take the second part and I\u2019ll just take the first part real quick because that one is easy -- we\u2019re seeing strength right now pretty much across the board. David. \nDavid White: Shawn, can you repeat the second piece of it?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It has to do with price -- ASPs and units -- \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Yes, units and pricing. \nDavid White: Well they are both obviously up quarter over quarter and if you\u2019re looking from an outlook standpoint, we\u2019re anticipating them being up again as well. From an ASP standpoint, it\u2019s kind of -- our ASPs are kind of a -- greatly influenced by the mix of the product that we are selling and so we tend to -- we tend to have product shifts that tend to maintain ASP in each of the three mainstream performance enthusiast categories we try and support.  So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s necessarily a strong indicator directionally one way or the other as it relates to ASPs in the GPU segment. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, but the ASPs were up, you said?\nDavid White: You know, when you look at it from a mix standpoint, the mix factors into that so when you look at it by those three segments that I was saying, yes, they are up in two of those segments and modestly down in the third. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then my last one, did you have any benefit from the sale of the inventory you wrote down in prior quarters?\nDavid White: No -- immaterial. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to reporting our results for Q3. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

In order to allow more people to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. After our response, we will allow one follow-up question. With that, let me turn the call over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Today we reported revenue of $664.2 million, and a GAAP net loss of $0.37. This included a one-time tender offer to purchase employee stock options that were significantly under water. On a non-GAAP basis, we had a net loss of $0.09 per share. Revenues grew 38% over the previous quarter as we gain market share in both channel sell-out and OEM inventory replenishment increased.  During the quarter, we made good progress managing operating expenses and reducing inventory. We have ongoing initiatives to reduce operating expenses further while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives, which are: one, maintaining our GPU leadership; two, driving the GPU computing revolution; three, increasing the adoption of GPUs in all segments of computing; and four, leading the mobile computing revolution.  Our discrete desktop GPU share increased again this quarter. In the discrete desktop GPU segment, we gained 6% to 69%.  Our notebook and desktop GPU share are about the same and the desktop GPU has exceeded our previous record levels achieved during Q1 of 2008. In addition to graphics leadership, our strategy is to lead the industry to the next level with physics processing. With our physics engine and library, which is available for PC, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and the iPhone, game developers can create amazing environments using physics simulations that are dynamic, realistic, and interactive with the player.  PhsyX has been adopted by EA, THQ, 2K Games, and most recently, Sega. We have built up a rich pipeline of exciting games with PhsyX support. Mirror\u2019s Edge and Sacred 2 have shipped and received rave reviews, and we anticipate the release of Terminator Salvation, Dark Void, Darkest of Days, You Wars, and Cryostasis -- each of these titles, when run over the 100 million NVIDIA CUDA GPUs in the market will experience a dramatic speed-up. Physics processing is extremely taxing even for the highest-end CPUs. By offloading the processing to CUDA, the parallel computing mode of our GPUs, we can speed up physics processing by an astonishing five to 20 times. And it\u2019s clear now that physics processing is becoming a must-have technology, just as programmable shading has been the last five years.  Utilizing the GPU for parallel computing is one of our most important strategic initiatives. We invented CUDA to harness the massive computational resources in a GPU that is otherwise used only for 3D graphics. The adoption of CUDA is global and GPU computing has reached the tipping point.  GPU computing will be incorporated into the two most important operating systems in the very near future -- Windows 7 with DX compute, and OS 10 Snow Leopard with Open CL will incorporate GPU computing into the core operating system and the GPU will become indispensable to achieve a great computing experience. This quarter we released our first Open CL drivers to developers who participated in our open CL early access program and demonstrated DirectX compute on Windows 7 at the Game Developers Conference.  There\u2019s a growing lists of consumer applications that are accelerated by CUDA. I spoke about physics processing that will be in nearly every game. This quarter, motion DSP [D-Reveal], ArtSoft\u2019s SIM HD, Cyberlink\u2019s Espresso, Nero Move It, and Super [Loylascope] announced support for CUDA.  CUDA has opened up the high performance computing market to our GPUs. We server this multi-billion dollar new growth market with a product line called TESLA. This is a greenfield market for us and our three-year effort has given us a significant lead to the competition. We have traction in virtually every major high performance computing category from finance to oil and gas to medical imaging, to super computing centers. We have significant projects throughout the U.S., Asia, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Europe, Eastern Europe, and India. Success stories are surfacing from all over the world. This quarter in China, Geostar is performing the search for oil and gas using TESLA. Working with the Institute of Geology and Geophysics as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Geostar has demonstrated its solution of running 600 times faster than what was previously possible with a CPU-based cluster.  French banking giant BNP Paribas Corporate and investment banking division recently replaced 500 CPU cores with just eight TESLA GPUs. They sped up response times by 15X while consuming less than one-tenth the power. BNP Paribas effectively reduced the energy consumption of performing the same calculation by nearly 200 times. Increasing computation throughput while reducing cost and energy consumption has become a mission critical imperative for nearly every company.  We announced this week the TESLA GPU pre-configured cluster, which increases the accessibility of super-computing clusters to the millions of engineers, scientists and researchers around the world. The TESLA pre-configured cluster is a ready-to-install super-computer that is available from a network of certified TESLA vars including [Cray], Penguin, [Apro], [Colfax], James River, and many others around the world.  We believe a GPU can dramatically enhance the performance of a PC of any budget. We created ION to bring the benefits of the GPU to the smallest and most affordable PCs. The recently announced Acer Aspire Revo is a full Vista Premium PC available at the price of a basic entry level machine, yet it provides everything the mainstream consumer wants from a PC, including very high quality Blu-Ray playback and modern DX10 games. Because of the ultra-high integration and lower power of ION, Acer was able to create a small, quiet, provocative industrial design that is light enough to hang on the back of your display.  Last week, the first 5,000 Revos delivered to Germany e-tail sold out in one day. The Aspire Revo has been winning rave reviews. Digital Trends predicted that it should be one of the most successful desktop products released this year.  ION has forever changed what consumers can expect from the mainstream PC. Even affordable and small PCs can be wonderful and deliver the full PC experience. More ION based platforms will be available from virtually every major PC OEM. You can expect to hear a great deal in the months ahead about the many ION design wins.  At the World Mobile Conference in February, we revealed our Tegra Netbook. At less than one watt of power, Tegra can surf the web and present the full high resolution experience to the Internet. With Tegra, we are enabling a new class of web-based computers that is high resolution like a PC, yet always on like a smartphone. We now have Tegra design wins that range from portable media players, smartphones, netbooks and other new classes of mobile Internet devices. Research from iSupply projects shipments of Internet enabled devices ranging from ultra-mobile PCs to portable media players to increase nine-fold in the next four years.  More than 400 million of these devices will be shipped in 2012, an annual compound growth rate of better than 50%. We look forward to announcing exciting Tegra devices in the coming months. Our nearly four-year investment in Tegra has positioned us squarely at the center of the next computing revolution. We estimate that Tegra has opened up an additional $10 billion growth market for us.  Now let me introduce David White, who succeeded Marv Burkett earlier this year as CFO. David brings 25 years of experience to the role, most recently as CFO of [Samnia SCI]. He is already making a big impact here. I want to take this opportunity to thank Marv for his enormous contributions to NVIDIA over the past six years. Marv leaves a legacy that he can be very proud of. He is continuing in an advisory role, working with David and me to facilitate a smooth transition and taking on projects that can benefit from his expertise.  With that, let me turn the call over to David. \nDavid White: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. My comments today will focus on a review of our first quarter results of operations, both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, along with a discussion of selected balance sheet accounts and cash flows. I will then conclude with comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. As Jen-Hsun indicated in his opening comments, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $664 million, which was up 38% from $481 million in the prior quarter, and significantly higher than our estimate, which was flat to slightly up.  We reported a GAAP net loss of approximately $201 million, or $0.37 per share. Our GAAP net loss included a one-time charge of $140 million associated with a cash tender offer we previously announced to purchase certain employee stock options. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $0.27 per share in the prior quarter.  Excluding the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, we reported a non-GAAP net loss for the quarter of $47 million, or a net loss of $0.09 per share. This compares with an $0.18 non-GAAP net loss per share in the prior quarter.  Let me now turn to our individual businesses -- our GPU business, which includes desktop, notebook, and memory -- represented 53% of our total revenue and recorded a 44% revenue increase quarter over quarter. Much of this increase was driven by the strength of the desktop segment, which was up almost 50% quarter over quarter. You will recall that last quarter\u2019s revenue in this segment was negatively impacted by low sell-in to the channel as our channel partners worked to aggressively deplete excess inventories. Channel inventories now appear to have stabilized at slightly over one month\u2019s supply, with our Q1 sales into the channel roughly approximately channel sales out. As such, our desktop revenue figures in Q1 more closely approximately true end-market demand than what we had experienced in Q4.  The notebook segment of our GPU business was up 28% quarter over quarter, driven primarily by increased OEM demand, which comprised the vast majority of this segment. Here also, fourth quarter revenues were abnormally impacted by OEM inventory corrections that have now abated.  Our MCP business, which represented 28% of our total revenue during the quarter, was up approximately 94% quarter over quarter. Demand was primarily driven by our chipset products designed for the mainstream AMD integrated desktop segment, as well as our chipset products designed for the Intel-based notebook segment.  Revenue for our PSB business, which includes workstation graphics and computing, was essentially flat quarter over quarter and represented 16% of total revenue. Our share in this segment remains stable -- corporate demand, which comprises a substantial percentage of this business, has not shown any signs of economic recovery at this point. This reflects constrained budgets and consumer redeployment and upgrade activity of older equipment.  Looking at the business as a whole, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 28.6%. Excluding charges associated with a stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.6%.  Our non-GAAP gross margin, which fell short of expectations and estimates, was impacted by several items. First, while revenue in our PSB business was flat quarter over quarter, as a percentage of total company revenue, it accounted for less of the total. Because our PSB business is generally more profitable than the rest of our business, this had an overall negative impact of approximately four points on gross margin.  Second, gross margin was also negatively impacted by the sell-off of some of our older 65-nanometer product, the effect of which was only partially offset by various reserve true-ups.  GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $421 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which again excluded charges associate with the stock option tender offer, as well as other stock-based compensation, amounted to $260 million, essentially flat quarter over quarter and consistent with our estimate.  Payroll related expenses were up quarter over quarter, due to the holiday shut-down in the fourth quarter, and additional FICA based payroll taxes we accrued in the first quarter. However, this increase was largely offset by cost reduction efforts that we realized elsewhere.  Our GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was a benefit of 10.4% and our non-GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 7.5%. NVIDIA's worldwide employment at the end of the quarter stood at 5,480, up 60 from the fourth quarter. We essentially have a hiring freeze in the U.S., with only the most critical positions being filled.  Turning to the balance sheet, accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $304 million, which equated to a DSO of approximately 42 days, an improvement of approximately 18 days from the prior quarter.  Inventories at the end of the quarter were $327 million, down $211 million, or 39% quarter over quarter. Inventory days at quarter end were 64. This compares with 145 days at the end of the prior quarter. These reductions resulted from rescheduling actions we took in response to our high inventory carryover from Q4, as well as early implementation of the staging of inventories at a pre-finished state just prior to custom configuration. We believe this latter change is important to us because it will enable us to better respond to changing market demand while at the same time maintaining overall inventory levels.  Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to approximately $51 million, slightly up from $48 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter amounted to $21 million, which as a result of our cost reduction efforts, was significantly down from the $43 million we spent in the prior quarter.  Accounts payable at the end of the quarter were $226 million, up approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, and our free cash flow for the first quarter was a positive $121 million.  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities at the end of the quarter were approximately $1.34 billion, up approximately $83 million quarter over quarter. This figure is significant considering we paid out approximately $82 million associated with the stock option tender offer we completed in March.  In closing, let me briefly comment on our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2010. While it was particularly difficult during these economic times to place a high degree of certainly in market demand and the pricing environment we compete in, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: we expect revenue to be up quarter over quarter in the range of 5%. As for gross margin, while we are not expecting any near-term improvement in demand in the workstation market, we do believe cost reduction efforts will allow us to improve margins. Accordingly, we expect our GAAP margins to be in the range of 32% to 34%.  We expect GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million. \n : This concludes my remarks. I thank you for your time and with that, I would like to open the call up for questions. Operator, can we take questions at this point. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Good afternoon, guys. Can we talk a little bit more about the inventory -- can you talk -- can you give us a little more detail about were there any inventory write-downs and did you sell through any -- or you mentioned you sold through some previously reserved inventory. Can you quantify a little better what the write-offs were or how much of the reserves that there were that you sold through with essentially zero cost, and how much still had some cost associated with it?\nDavid White: We have actually a couple of situations -- we have inventory that we completely wrote off in a prior period. We also have inventories that we wrote down to market value. Some of those inventories in both categories were sold during the quarter, some of which we had gains on, some of which we had losses on. It turns out that the losses we experienced on the sale of that inventory plus some of the other products actually offset that by a greater amount, and so on a net basis, it was actually a negative impact to the quarter. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: And was that basically because you, of the amount that you had written down, you hadn\u2019t written it down enough?\nDavid White: That\u2019s correct. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: So is that -- \nDavid White: In some cases. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: In some cases -- did that then trigger any other accounting accruals on the balance sheet and is that part of what explains the inventory, the big inventory drop as well?\nDavid White: There was also a modest amount of new lower cost [to market] accruals as well. On a net basis, it was negative, as I indicated. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay. Thanks, that makes sense. And then, when you talk about the gross margin improvement going into the next quarter, how much of -- number one, do you expect any additional inventory write-downs or do you expect to sell through any inventory that has previously been reserved for? And then can you help quantify a little bit further what that improvement is coming from? Is it just mix shift back to PSB or is it mix shift within GPU as well, perhaps some of the newer products, like the 40-nanometer products?\nDavid White: In the outlook for the second quarter, we\u2019ll repeat much I think of the same scenario we had in the first quarter. We will continue to sell off some inventory that we have written off and we will continue to sell some inventory that we have written down to lower cost of market. Right now, I would anticipate that the net effect of those two would be roughly a wash. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, and then what kind of improvement to gross margin do you expect from the mix shift to not just the professional solutions business but also from the newer products? The newer GPU products, I mean?\nJenny Shanks: David, obviously we are ramping 40-nanometer very aggressively but we haven\u2019t announced any new products yet, and so it\u2019s not appropriate to talk about new products right now.  In terms of next quarter\u2019s gross margins, obviously we have consumed a lot more of our 65-nanometer inventory this quarter and I think that the amount of our 65-nanometer inventory at this point is quite negligible. And so that is going to help our gross margins going forward.  Those are the biggest levers and we are looking forward to having the PSB business coming back online as the enterprise starts to buy again. We have really exciting new products for Quadro that we\u2019ve launched and that the OEMs have already geared up, and so as soon as the end market comes back to life, I think that the workstation business is going to do really well for us once again. \nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga: Okay, great. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thanks. Jen-Hsun, on the 40-nanometer, since you brought it up, I know you are not going to talk about new products that are not announced but can you give us an update on how the ramp is going relative to previous process nodes in terms of the ramp, the volumes, and can you give us an update on what percentage of the mix by the end of the year could be coming through that process node? Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Let\u2019s see -- the ramp is going fine. It\u2019s during the -- you know, we are ramping 40-nanometer probably harder than anybody and so we have three products in line now in 40-nanometer and more going shortly. So there\u2019s -- this is a very important node. TSMC is working very hard. We have a vast majority of their line cranking right now with new products, and so we are monitoring yields and they are improving nicely week-to-week-to-week, and so at this point, there\u2019s really not much to report.  In terms of the mix towards the end of the year, let\u2019s see -- I haven\u2019t -- my rough math would suggest about 25%, is my guess. I mean, there\u2019s still going to be a lot of 55-nanometer products. A lot of our MCP products, ION, for example, is still based on 55-nanometer and ION is going to be running pretty hard. I think you heard in David\u2019s comments earlier that our Intel chipset product line is our fastest growing business and so my sense is that that\u2019s going to continue to be successful and that is still in 55-nanometer. So I would say roughly 25% to 30% is my rough estimate going into the end of the year. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup : Could you just clarify again your OpEx guidance for the July quarter? Because I think I heard that it\u2019s going to be up Q-on-Q, and I just wanted to make sure I heard that right.\nDavid White: It\u2019s not up. It\u2019s about $280 million on a GAAP basis. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup : On a GAAP basis -- and what would it be on a pro forma basis?\nDavid White: The guidance we are giving for SBC for next quarter is around $25 million. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and then can you give us a sense, David -- when you look into the end of the fiscal year, for example, what are your thoughts about the kind of run-rate of operating expenses you expect to be on at that point, or really what I am asking, you make the point in the comments that you\u2019ve got OpEx programs in place. I just want to get a sense of maybe what those are and what the targets are for that program. \nDavid White: So I think in the first quarter conference call, we talked about a stretched goal for the company of about $265 million, and we are still working aggressively to achieve that objective. We have a lot of programs, as Jen-Hsun talked about in his comments, that we absolutely want to maintain our investments in and we feel strongly about the return we will ultimately achieve from those investments. And so our cost reduction activities are trying to balance maintaining all of the resources we can on those investments and still trying to spend our money as wisely as we possibly can, and so we are focusing on a lot of ways in terms of how we manage our expenses and where our expenses are actually incurred, and trying to influence them in ways that won\u2019t affect those programs. So I think the $265 million target is still intact and we are -- I assume we will achieve that sometime in the next -- certainly before the end of the calendar year and our fiscal year. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup : Okay, and one last one maybe for Jen-Hsun -- maybe talk about the pricing environment that you are seeing out there. Obviously we are in a unique demand environment here and any sense that you are seeing anything unique on pricing as a result?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Pricing is -- I would characterize as aggressive, but we are at a point now with the pricing where we think that we are going to be relatively stable for some time. And our products gain a premium in the marketplace relative to the competition, because of the reputation of our products and the performance of our product and increasingly the work that we do around physics and CUDA is being recognized as important, and I commented earlier the number of games that are coming out with PhsyX in the game are -- it\u2019s coming out in a really rich pipeline now and we are seeing game titles coming out on a regular basis now with PhsyX included.  And when you compare a game with PhsyX in it running on CUDA to one that is running on the CPU, the difference is so substantial that our GPU is just superior on so many different fronts. And so I think that we are going to leave our positioning in the marketplace with a premium to our products because it is a superior product and I think the market is recognizing that. \nGlen Yeung - Citigroup : Thanks. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.\nUche Orji - UBS: Thank you very much. David or Jen-Hsun, anyone can answer -- can I please ask you about how the quarter progressed? Because if I look at the DSOs, it seems to have dropped off quite sharply, so can you just give me a sense of how, month-by-month, the quarter progressed in terms of demand? Because looking at this one made me conclude that it looks like demand tailed off towards the end of the quarter. Is that the right conclusion?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Actually, it didn\u2019t. The quarter was a pretty solid quarter, I would say. In fact, we had spot shortages of several products and there were rumors of us pushing our supply chain really hard to get products out into the marketplace, and all of that is true. And we came into the quarter looking pretty good, so I think our -- the market is still uncertain and we monitor sell-out in every single geography for every single product like crazy these days, and so we\u2019ll continue to watch it but so far, so good. \nUche Orji - UBS: Okay. Just going back to -- David, going back to the margins, I think in the very first question, you were explaining that the impact of the inventory products that were sold, that the reserve was negative. So what is the cleanest gross margin? So if I walk off 30.6, and if I had to make adjustments for this inventory that were reserved and sold that had a negative impact -- I am trying to get a sense of what then is a clean gross margin for the quarter that just ended. \nDavid White: Well, I guess it depends on what your definition of clean is, I guess. Probably the single largest item that impacted margins in the quarter really is the fact that our workstation business, our PSB business, as we call it, was a smaller mix, percentage of the total mix. And as I indicated in my comments, that was about a four point hit on margins. And it overwhelms, actually, the other factors. It is the single largest item and as we gave our guidance, we are not anticipating at this point that is going to change any time soon, so if you wanted to find a clean quarter as our workstation business being back at the historical levels it\u2019s been, you could add four points to margin.  I think the other items that I indicated are a much smaller consequence. \nUche Orji - UBS: Sure. And just the last question on the workstation business, obviously watching the end markets [inaudible], it looks like things sure looked pretty challenged for some time. Let me ask you about competition in this market -- I mean, we\u2019ve seen some of AMD\u2019s products getting designed into some HP workstations. Are you starting to notice any signs of improved competition? Are these products getting any traction that may affect your longer term market share in this area? That\u2019s my last question. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We are frankly not seeing competitive pressure in our workstation business. I think the competition has repeatedly claimed design wins in the workstation business for years now and this is just not a -- it\u2019s not a chip business. This is a chip and a system solution, system software. It\u2019s a complicated business and you are building products that needs to not only be great at Windows but Linux and just about every ancient operating system on the planet. And so it\u2019s a very, very complicated business and the reason why our market share is so high has a lot to do with the investment that we put into it, and so this is -- this is a business that is about solving some of the most challenging problems in computing in the world and we are really, really good at it, and so I think we read about press releases from the competition from time to time and we take it all seriously but the fact of the matter is, it just takes a lot more investment than that to be successful.\nUche Orji - UBS: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Thank you. A quick question on the ION revenue contribution -- you guys had a huge revenue upside in the first quarter. A lot of that was due to improving sellout demand. How much was that related to the ION business and a related question, what were the gross margins on the ION business and what were the pricing ASPs on the ION?\nJen-Hsun Huang: So let\u2019s see -- hey, David, what was our Intel chipset business this quarter? Do you have the numbers over there? Total Intel chipset business? We basically only have one Intel-based chipset that we are shipping in any meaningful amount, so -- \nDavid White: I don\u2019t have it broken out, Jen-Hsun, between the two here with me. \nJen-Hsun Huang: What was the total -- was it about $200 million, $180 million or so?\nDavid White: $180 million is the total. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay, and so I would expect about -- out of that $180 million, about two-thirds of it, maybe a little bit less than that comes from the ION chipset and the way to think about that is in Q2 of last year, one year ago, that amount was approximately zero and so that gives you a sense for the adoption of our products in that segment. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Right, but are you including the 9400M that you are showing to Apple as the -- as ION or is this actually two-thirds of that $180 million design wins with other companies outside of Apple that are using ION?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t distinguish the two -- I mean, it\u2019s the same processor from our perspective. The -- we call it the platform ION and increasingly people are calling the chip ION, and so we don\u2019t distinguish the two, whatever people want to call it. I mean, when people buy the chipset from us, they call it ION. When the put it into the box and they brand it from the outside, because GeForce is such a terrific brand and contributes so much to the brand value of the end product, people call it GeForce. Do you see what I\u2019m saying? So people buy the ION but they sell it as a GeForce. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of what additional design wins with other PC manufacturers outside of Apple are you getting with ION? I am trying to get an understanding of again the traction of ION outside of just the Apple business that was announced a few quarters back.\nJen-Hsun Huang: If you estimate that Apple represents a little bit north of 50% of that, then I think it\u2019s relatively correct. So the traction is good, and if you think about who the fastest growing PC companies are in the world, I think that\u2019s Apple and Acer and [Asus Tech] and -- you know, they are all huge ION customers. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   And any sense of what the gross margins or ASPs on that platform were in this quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: About or better than corporate average. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   The corporate average of this quarter of 30.6% or just what you have done historically?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Better than this quarter. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   All right. And then, can you give us any update in terms of the GT300 architecture, or the next generation architecture? Is that on schedule for the second half of \u201909 or do you foresee any potential roadblocks with that rollout?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t comment about future products. Our current products are doing very, very nicely in the marketplace. What\u2019s the point of talking about future products?\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay, and just on the -- going on in terms of the revenue guidance of up 5%, how should we be looking at it in terms of individual business units? Should we be looking at kind of normal seasonality across the difference categories? And then should we be looking at the workstation business getting back up to like say 20% of total revenue, which has historically been in that range?\nDavid White: I would -- if I was modeling it out, I would assume workstation is flat and apply the 5% ratably to the other businesses. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   So even with the flat workstation business, which carries a higher gross margin, you are still expecting 32%, 34% of GAAP gross margin?\nDavid White: Yes. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. What is it on a non-GAAP basis? Are you able to break that out?\nDavid White: It\u2019s not much different. SBC is like 20 bps, 0.2 -- small difference. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company:   Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Stifel Nicolaus.\nPatrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. This is Patrick Newton in for Cody Acree. This question goes to Dave -- I guess if you could speak a little bit -- if we started looking out at long-term gross margin, what does it take to get us back into the 40% range? And I guess is this something that you guys think is achievable in the fiscal \u201911 timeframe?\nDavid White: I guess I would throw in a couple of things here. One is -- Jen-Hsun, you can jump in here, obviously -- our business and margins are heavily influenced by our high-end performance products and clearly as we move forward and TESLA and TEGRA and some of these other products that we have been talking about and continue to invest in become a part of our revenue mix and so forth, we believe that within that time period, we can be getting our margins back up into that kind of arena. \nJen-Hsun Huang: If you look at our history, there was a time when we were -- we had rather low gross margins, and I think it was as low as 28 points, or something like that. And we, over the course of about a year-and-a-half, methodically worked our gross margins back up and exceeded our record levels.  I have every confidence that the operational initiatives that we have in place today that looked at the reasons why our gross margins are challenged right now and the new mix of products that we are bringing to the marketplace and our -- you know, my full confidence that the industries will be revived and I will need to buy tools for their engineers, who are the hearts and souls of all industries, you know, will return. And when that happens, our gross margins have every opportunity to return to its record levels and potentially beyond. And so those are things that we are putting in place and the teams are executing fabulously across the board. If you watched us the last time, relentlessly march up our gross margins, we intend to do exactly the same this time. \nPatrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Thank you. And then moving on, so talking about some of these new products that you guys just touched on, TESLA and TEGRA, could you talk about what kind of revenue you saw from TESLA in this quarter, and maybe some kind of expectation throughout the remainder of the fiscal year? And then also in regard to TEGRA, if you could talk about some -- if there\u2019s been any recent change in design win momentum and any expectations you have for TEGRA in the back half of the year ramping perhaps a target run-rate exiting the fiscal year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: TESLA was many millions of dollars and next quarter will be more, is my expectation. The traction that we are getting designing them into clusters all over the world, as I mentioned in my comments, are really doing terrifically and the national labs around the world are all benefiting from stimulus packages as the various governments invest in energy exploration and investing in education, and so I think those are all -- and TESLA is just in a fine spot at the right time. And so my expectation is that TESLA is going to continue do to well and we will grow it into a rather nice business. Hopefully within the next couple of years into a business like Quadro and potentially larger.  TEGRA has -- we introduced a new category for TEGRA at the World Mobile Conference, and this is a TEGRA Netbook. Prior to that, we only had TEGRA smartphones and TEGRA portable media player design wins. Those products are just reaching the final production ready for final design phase and starting to ramp in production, and so we are -- I am expecting revenues this quarter and growing throughout the rest of the year. But this last quarter, we introduced a TEGRA netbook reference platform and we have many ODMs and OEMs working with us to bring TEGRA Netbook to the marketplace.  You know, the telcos have discovered that when they can give away a computer with a subscription and that computer is a couple hundred dollars, they can really drive subscription rates, and so we are pretty excited about this and the telcos are pretty excited about it as well, with 3G data modems becoming so affordable, this is really a terrific way for them to increase their revenues.  And the ARPU for a netbook that is high resolution and readily accessible so that you can stream high definition video or use Facebook wherever you are, the telcos are pretty enthusiastic about the type of ARPUs they will generate from these type of devices.  So I think this is going to be a new growth category for us and we are working really hard to get it to production. \nPatrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : And Jen-Hsun, when we think about TEGRA ASPs, is it right to think of smartphones and then later on, maybe another $10 for mids and then some incremental, maybe $10 for netbooks on top of that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let\u2019s see -- help me understand your algorithm again. \nPatrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Sorry -- if I think of ASPs for smartphones maybe being in the $10, $15 range, mids being $10 more than that in the $25 type of range, and then netbooks a little bit more -- is that the right way to think of the ASPs for TEGRA?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would think of the PNPs to be very similar to smartphones. I think the mids are higher than that. I think your $10 is about right. And then I think netbooks on the high end of mids, so I agree with that. \nPatrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus : Perfect. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gana with GMP Securities.\nAlex Gana - GMP Securities: Thank you very much. I am wondering about on the TESLA platforms how you get through or how you are working with potential customers to get some of the software that may be running on legacy hardware or standard hardware over to be TESLA compatible or adoptable in your systems?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The vast majority of the serious computing clusters in the world run proprietary software. Oil and gas -- proprietary; finance, proprietary, and so there is a large internal development teams that protect these algorithms of theirs like we protect our algorithms and so we work with each one of their engineering teams or development teams to port to TESLA and the porting process is just all over the world and you could go -- and many of them when they do a port are so delighted by the results, they publish a paper. And if you go to Google and google CUDA GPU or NVIDIA CUDA GeForce GPU, you are going to find just reams and reams of paper that show the speed-ups that we talk about.  You can also come to CUDA Zone -- do a search on CUDA Zone and you will see a whole bunch of applications that have been ported and the results that they are seeing. So that\u2019s one method.  We also work with software developers that target the verticals, and so they could be a small consulting firm for computational finance. They could be a small consult or large consulting firm for oil and gas discovery, so we work with them to develop software. And we will also port the major software packages like [Met Lab] and so there\u2019s a piece of software that has been developed for [Met Lab] that accelerates [Met Lab] some 15, 20 times, and there\u2019s some being developed again further to accelerating them further to that.  And so we just -- we approached these applications based on what we think has the greatest potential to serve the market and also the greatest potential for speed-up. And so we just -- we work on all of them at the same time with a rather large dev tech team, a developer relations team, and we are working with the software developers all over the world. And so you just have to work on this one at a time.  Now, the exciting thing about all of this is many of them were re-factoring and re-developing their software to run on multi-core CPUs and because they were so unsuccessful and frustrated by multi-core CPUs, TESLA showed up at exactly the right time, or CUDA showed up at exactly the right time. And so this is a -- this is really a perfect alignment of an industry that\u2019s run out of choices but still needs to see significant speed. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could start out on the notebook market a little bit and give us a sense of what you are seeing in that market with respect to mix of discrete and integrated GPUs, and whether you see that -- any shifts that would be permanent there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, in the notebook market, the discrete versus integrated has been relatively stable, I think. Probably about 25% of the notebooks are discrete. It might have been a little lower this quarter -- well, it probably is lower this quarter because of the significant growth of netbooks. And so if you excluded the netbooks, my sense is that discreet has probably gained relatively to integrated graphics. But let\u2019s just assume that it\u2019s relatively flat and going forward, the interesting dynamic is -- and we are anxious to see this play out but we are starting to hear from all over the world that integrated graphics don\u2019t have DX Computer. DX Computer is the single most important new API from Windows 7 and it helps you do amazing things. If you have made a home movie and you put it on your PC and you wanted edit -- you know, add video editing and add some special effects to it and stitch a few photos and videos together, and you want to render it back to a DVD so you can send it to grandparents -- you know, that process without GPU computing is horrific. I mean, to make a one-hour movie, it will probably take you 10 hours to record it. And so with DX Compute, that one hour has become one hour and one hour, and so it\u2019s just a revolutionary speed-up when it comes down to certain types of application that are very parallel and very data intensive, very computer intensive.  And so I think without DX Compute on integrated graphics chips, the question is how will these PCs compete? And so we are seeing a lot more interest in people who need to put GPUs in their notebooks and desktop computers when Windows 7 comes around. \nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, and maybe just as a follow-up, could you give us an update on the magnitude of revenues you expect from TESLA in the current fiscal year, please?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You know, it\u2019s really hard to say exactly but if we did less than $50 million, I would be disappointed and I would be delighted if we are on a run-rate of north of $100 million going out of the year. \nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with Friedman, Billings, Ramsay.\nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: This is Robert for Craig. Thanks for taking my question -- can you give us a better idea of what ASPs did in the quarter for desktops and notebooks for your chips? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: David, you probably have that over there. \nDavid White: Probably most of our compression on ASPs probably came in the GPU line of our business in some select particular models and so forth. It was a little bit higher this last quarter than what we have traditionally seen on some particular programs on a quarter over quarter basis, that is. \nJen-Hsun Huang: If you look at ASPs quarter to quarter, it surely should have increased because we gained share in most of our -- well, almost all of our share gains came from the high end. So we gained about 6% share over quarter over quarter, and so that should -- all of that is high-end share, so our ASP should have gone up. \nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: And then going forward, do you expect your ASPs to be stable from here, I guess on the lower end stuff?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say that ASPs are relatively stable right now and we are focused on differentiating our products with PhsyX and with CUDA, with GPU computing and the competition\u2019s products are really graphics only and as more and more applications come out that have GPU computing capabilities and ports, and as more and more games have physics, we are going to focus on differentiating that way. S\nCraig Berger - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with J.P. Morgan.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Just honing in on the gross margins for a second, can you clarify something -- did you say that the inventory that you got in, you had an inventory reserve benefit in Q1, did I hear that correctly?\nDavid White: What I indicated was that we had inventory true-ups, some of which were unfavorable, some of which were favorable, the net of which, when you netted that against the products that they related to and we sold was a net unfavorable impact on the quarter. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: So it hurt gross margins?\nDavid White: Correct.\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then on the segment level, given the -- if you ex out the options write-down, did your desktop and notebook gross margins fall sequentially, GPU?\nDavid White: What was the first part of that though? Can you repeat the first part of that?\nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: If you take out that $11 million charge to COGS and you just look at your segment gross margins, desktop GPU, notebook GPU -- \nDavid White: Yeah, we don\u2019t typically look at that included in there anyway. Okay, yes, I understand what you are saying -- no, they did not. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: They did not fall sequentially? \nDavid White: Correct. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay. So circling back then to the reserve, bad news, what was the dollar magnitude of that?\nDavid White: We\u2019ve really not broken that out. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: I see. Okay, and then as options, looking at options going forward, are they going to stay at the $25 million run-rate?\nDavid White: That\u2019s about right. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then as far as channel inventories, Jen-Hsun, earlier you mentioned that you believe that at this -- and this is what we are all trying to figure out, is what is in-demand, what is catching up with in-demand -- how do you see channel inventories right now and as you look at your various lines of business, including chipsets, desktop, notebook, which do you think still have some catch-up to do and which do you think have caught-up with in-demand?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It\u2019s harder for us to tell on notebooks because we don\u2019t monitor sell-outs on notebooks. They are OEM products. But in terms of desktop products, we know that our channel inventory is near all-time lows, and so we continue to have spot shortages of products here and there. And so we are -- my sense is that based on what we are selling in and based on what is selling out and what we believe the channel inventory to be, the market looks relatively stable right now. \nShawn Webster - J.P. Morgan: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Global Crown Capital.\nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Yes, I am afraid I need some help on understanding gross margin guidance for Q2 -- since the workstation business is not -- it\u2019s not moving up or down as a percentage of revenue, I see a significant bump in your gross margin guidance for Q2. Is that a function of the mix of 55-nanometer or any new products relative to 65-nanometer to give you this meaningful lift in gross margin quarter on quarter?\nDavid White: That is certainly a piece of it, yes, absolutely.  \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: So that must be the biggest piece, right? Because essentially we are not talking about major differences between workstation business and the rest of the company. \nDavid White: Well [there are other] cost reduction measures that we\u2019ve taken as a company. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: I see. Okay. The other thing I was wondering, essentially to expect a nice recovery in the professional solutions business, I guess just look to IT spending, is that the way to look at it? If we have an IT spending recovery in the second half of this calendar year, then the highest gross margin business would come back. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that\u2019s not a bad surrogate, but we also have to think along the lines of creating new products that can save our customers money. We demonstrated at the National Association of Broadcasters the world\u2019s first digital in graphics compositor digital out product and it\u2019s -- we call it Quadro DVP, digital video pipeline. And it\u2019s the first of its kind ever built and it replaces quite a large amount of servers and switches and video mixers and the reception has been just fabulous. And so what we need to do is get into production. As you know, more and more of the broadcasters are streaming off on the web and this product is designed to be able to record in real-time and composite in real-time and stream it real-time on the web. And so that is a growth market and so we think that there are opportunities for us to innovate our way out of this, even if the IT spending doesn\u2019t come back in the near future. So we have all kinds of ideas that we are working on. You\u2019ve been following us a long time -- we\u2019re a pretty relentless bunch of guys and we have lots of good ideas and in spite of challenges, there are always ways to grow.  You know, you look at ION, it\u2019s our fastest growing business because we\u2019ve tapped into a movement towards low-end advanced mainstream computing. You saw that we are gaining share. You saw that we are creating new products like TESLA and TEGRA, both of which saves money, and so we can find new ways to grow, even if the economy is challenged. \nDavid Wu - Global Crown Capital: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji DeSilva with Kaufman Brothers.\nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarter and inventories there -- in the 5% sequential guidance, is that typical -- is that the linearity you are expecting that similar typical years or is this year any different somehow?\nDavid White: Traditionally our July quarter is seasonally the weaker quarter of the year, one of the weakest quarters of the year.\nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: I meant the linearity month to month. \nDavid White:  In terms of the second quarter or the first quarter?\nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Correct -- no, the coming quarter. \nDavid White: I think the second quarter will be pretty close to the same linearity we had in the first quarter, which was better than average. \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Okay, and then as we look at the consumer ultra low voltage, CULV opportunity, is that neutral for you, Jen-Hsun, or do you think that\u2019s an opportunity in terms of your content?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That\u2019s neutral for us because we don\u2019t participate in the mid-range of notebooks anyhow. If you look at our historical notebook participation, we have been only on the top third of the market and the bottom two-thirds of the market has been integrated for just about forever.  We entered into the low-end part of the marketplace recently with MCP 79 or ION and so we are taking share in the mainstream and the low-end part of the market. What\u2019s exciting to me is come Windows 7 and when DX Compute comes out, the difference between a computer that has DX Compute accelerated by a GPU versus one that does not is not a 10%, 15%, it\u2019s 10, 20, 30 times. I just don\u2019t know how -- and it\u2019s not for games. It\u2019s for making movies for your grandparents. And we know that one of the fastest growing consumer products right now is the flip video camcorder and the Sony Wedding -- those things are selling like hotcakes, and they are HD camcorders. People are making home movies and they want to create a home movie and post it on the web or burn a DVD. And so I think the -- finally it\u2019s possible to do video editing because of DX Compute and because of the GPU underneath it that is not excruciating. I mean, it\u2019s a delightful experience and one of these days, if you get a chance to drop by, we\u2019ll just show you how to do it. It\u2019s just incredibly easy. When you can move a video file around and store it the way that you save files, you know, it changes everything.  This is going to be one of the major usage models for Windows 7 and so we are excited about that and I think that all computers, and I made this comment in my remarks, that we believe and certainly I believe that every computer will benefit with GPUs in it. It will reduce the power.  One of the most -- if you read review so the Macbook Air, that has a rather large GPU, GeForce 9400, in a ultra thin and light computer and the power is better than it was before with Intel integrated graphics. People remark about that all over the web, and so it\u2019s because GPUs, using the right tool to do the right job, saves power and when BNP Paribas and others discover that by using the GPU, you can save 200 times the energy because you run a process faster and it consumes less power, you save a lot of energy and energy consumption comes right out of the battery. And so I think that more and more people are just starting to discover that adding another processor that does the right job on the right -- you know, using the right tool for the right jobs, it really saves power, really saves energy. \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great, that\u2019s helpful color and one last question, if I can squeeze it in -- Jensen, in terms of TEGRA versus ION, which one do you think has a larger unit TAM? I\u2019m assuming -- I think it\u2019s TEGRA but if you can confirm that. And which one do you think will have more units in the marketplace in say two to three years, TEGRA or ION?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh my gosh, TEGRA -- TEGRA, of all of the products in our company, TEGRA has long-term the largest TAM. And the number of -- \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: In two or three years, you believe there will be more TEGRAs out there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh yeah, I think in two or three years -- surely, surely. I think the -- TEGRA is -- you know, we\u2019ve been investing in TEGRA now for about four years and we have one of our best teams in the company working on this. There\u2019s 500 people working on TEGRA and to build a computer completely from scratch that first on the size of a penny and deliver a full high definition experience, consume less than one watt, it\u2019s just -- when you see it, it\u2019s just absolutely magical and we -- it\u2019s possible to do that and we are just blowing people away when we show it to them. This is -- I really believe this is the second personal computer revolution. We happen to be fortunate to have in our careers experienced two computing revolutions. This is it. We want to be all over it, and so this is an exciting time for TEGRA. \nSuji DeSilva - Kaufman Brothers: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck, guys. \nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen-Hsun. Please go ahead. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our progress in Q2. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you very much for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Hara, you may begin your conference.\nMichael Hara: Thank you, Philip. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. With me on the call today are from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President, Chief Executive Officer; and David White, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up question. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded.

I would also like to remind everyone about our upcoming financial analyst day on March 8, taking place at our headquarters in Santa Clara. If you are interested in attending, you can register on our Investor Relations website. With that, let's begin. Last month, NVIDIA and TSMC shipped our 1 billionth GeForce GPU. This milestone is less than 12 years in the making, and over that period of time, the complexity of the GPU has increased more than 1,000x. Having advanced from being a fixed-function graphics accelerator to one of the most powerful programmable computing devices in the world, the GPU is enabling enormous progress in computers ranging from smartphones and tablets to PCs and game consoles to work stations and supercomputers. And in that time, the GPU has become the defining technology for every platform that uses it. Our new $1.5 billion cross-licensing agreement with Intel underscores the growing importance of the GPU to the future of personal computing as well as to the expanding markets for mobile and cloud computing. Heading into the year, we have one of the best lineups of GPUs in the company's history. The GTX 580 remains in the top spot as the fastest DX11 GPU for enthusiast gamers. We extended our DX11 technology leadership with the launch of the GTX 570 and the GTX 560 Ti, heralded by reviewers as category leaders for the $349 and $249 core gamer price segments. Our GTX product stack is the gamers' choice and the results show. For the second consecutive quarter, our desktop standalone GPU share grew, increasing from 59% in Q3 to 61% in Q4, with higher share gains in the performance and enthusiasts segments.  And aside from our expectation to continue to gain share, there are several big events this year that can be catalysts for growth. First, Intel's Sandy Bridge is the best gamer CPU in a long time. And with the SLI motherboards from Intel, ASUS, Gigabyte and others, along with the new GTX 560 Ti, it offers gamers a perfect opportunity to upgrade their PC. Second, great games drive GeForce GTX sales. And this year, we expect to see a number highly anticipated games such as Crysis 2, Battlefield 3, Duke Nukem Forever, Portal 2 and Diablo III. And third, 3D Vision is all about enjoying games at a whole new level. Driven by great new 3D Vision licensed products such as Acer's new 27-inch 3D Vision panel and Dell's XPS 17-inch 3D Vision notebook, we expect the 3D Vision to grow 200% this year. NVIDIA's 3D Vision content ecosystem is the largest in the industry, with support for over 500 video games, Blu-ray movies and our new 3D Web portal, 3dvisionlive.com, which offers a wealth of streaming video and photographs. In notebooks, we announced a record number of design wins for the Intel Sandy Bridge platform. More than 200 new notebook models will feature our new GeForce 500M Series GPUs. Adding GeForce is one of the best ways for OEMs to differentiate PCs with premium capabilities versus the basic platforms based on Intel's graphics. Unlike basic graphics integrated into Sandy Bridge CPUs, GeForce GPUs provide advanced features and increased compatibility for latest PC games, including those based on DX11. Tesla achieved over $100 million in revenue in fiscal 2011. It\u2019s becoming conventional wisdom in technical computing that parallel processing delivers the highest performance as well as being the most energy efficient and cost-effective. The world's greatest petaflops and supercomputers are built with Tesla GPUs. The Green500 list for the world's most energy-efficient supercomputers revealed that Tsubame 2.0 from the Tokyo Institute of Technology was ranked number two and was the only petaflop system in the top 10. Three other Tesla-based systems made the top 10 along with the systems in 11th, 12th and 13th spots. During the quarter, HP, Dell and IBM all entered into production with their Tesla-powered servers. With the sales and market of the world's largest enterprise sales force engaged, we look forward to accelerating the adoption of Tesla. Technical computing servers enterprised in the cloud represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity for Tesla. CES was the coming-out party for our Tegra 2 customers. Motorola, LG, Acer, ASUS and Toshiba all announced their flagship smartphones and tablets with tremendous industry acclaim at CES. The MOTOROLA XOOM with Android 3.0 won overall Best of Show. And the ATRIX won Best of Show in the smartphone category. And LG began shipment of the Optimus 2X in Korea in January. At CES, we also unveiled our long-term processor initiative, codenamed Project Denver, to develop custom CPU cores based on the ARM architecture. This initiative is focused on NVIDIA's CPU running the ARM instruction set, which will be fully integrated in the same chip as the NVIDIA GPU. It will target personal computers, servers and supercomputers. In addition to Audi, which we have enjoyed a deep partnership since 2004, we announced two new partnerships at CES with BMW North America and Tesla Motors that will put NVIDIA processors in navigation and vehicle information systems across all next-generation BMW cars worldwide and the Tesla Roadster and Model S, respectively. In this week at the Mobile World Congress, Samsung joined our marquee list of customers announcing their Galaxy Tab 10.1 and their plans for a next-generation Tegra 2 superphone. LG also officially announced the new Optimus pad, which will be the G-Slate for T-Mobile. A highlight at MWC was the demonstration of Kal-El, the world's first mobile quad core processor. Kal-El, our next-generation Tegra SOC, which features a new 12-core NVIDIA GPU, provides 5x the performance of Tegra 2. We're beginning to sample Kal-El to strategic partners. And based on our competition announcements, we believe we are at least a year ahead of them. We are targeting to deliver Kal-El in tablets and smartphones later this year. Our strategy with Tegra is to utilize our deep expertise in IP and computing to create processors for the mobile computing revolution. We designed Tegra to be the most advanced processor for mobile applications and to target the tablet segment, which is expected to be approximately 208 million units by 2014 and the smartphone segment, which is growing at a compounded 19% annual growth rate to approximately 600 million units in five years as estimated by the Gartner Group. And now with Microsoft's announcements, Tegra can directly access the Windows PC market. Heading into Q1, our primary focus is to continue to ramp both our GeForce on Sandy Bridge and Tegra 2 customers into production. More importantly, our results are beginning to tell the bigger story about NVIDIA's transformation. Even as we are expanding our leadership in digital computing, our investments in Tegra, Tesla and Project Denver put us at the center of the two most disruptive revolutions happening with mobile and cloud computing. We have never been more optimistic about our growth opportunities. With that, let me turn the call over to David.\nDavid White: Thanks, Mike. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $886.4 million, up 5% sequentially. Gross margin of 48.1% was a record for the second consecutive quarter. It was at the high end of our range, primarily as a result of richer GPU product mix than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. GAAP OpEx was $247 million. This includes the Intel settlement of $57 million. Without it, our R&D and SG&A costs would have been a combined $304 million, in line with our estimates. Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $171.4 million (sic) [$171.7 million] or $0.29 per diluted share.  Revenue by business segment was as follows: our GPU business was up 5.5%; our MCP revenue was down significantly as we entered into the final phase of that business, but this was more than offset by strong growth in desktop and notebook discrete. Our Professional business was down slightly. Quadro was down, but this was almost completely offset by strong growth in Tesla. And our Consumer business was up despite a seasonally down console business thanks to a strong Tegra customer ramps. Turning to the balance sheet. Our focus on inventory reduction continue to make progress as we were able to reduce it by another 8.5% to $345.5 million. Channel inventory was at or below expectations. These results, together with receipt of our first payment from Intel, allowed us to report cash balances of approximately $2.5 billion.  Our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows: revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% from the fourth quarter; GAAP gross margin is expected to be 48.5% to 49.5%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $327 million; GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 18%. That includes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Uche Orji. [UBS]\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Let me just start out by asking you, what's going on with desktop GPU ASPs? They were up significantly from the way we're looking at it. Is this a combination of seasonality or channel feel? And is this sustainable? That's my first question.\nDavid White: Well, it's fairly mix. I mean, we launched three new products at the top of our product lineup, as Mike talked about in his comments. And those are all higher ASPs for the company. So they drove not only ASPs for us, but they also drove margin for us.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: All right. One more question I wanted to ask you, at Mobile World Congress, it seems like everyone is racing -- and this is for Mike, there's a race to launch quad core. And first of all, congratulations on the success you've had with Tegra 2. But the question I have on quad core is, first of all, is there enough application now to take advantage of this level of power that you are bringing in at the end of this year? And then secondly, do you need 28 nanometers to make this profitably? Can you talk about the economics of that? That's my second question.\nDavid White: Uche, I'll let Jen-Hsun answer that question. How is that?\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Sure.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Uche, let's see, quad core. It is the case that several of our competitors announced quad core products that will be sampled next year and potentially go into production the year after. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated Kal-El, and there were quite a few systems on-hand for demonstrating all aspects of Kal-El, whether it was extreme high-definition video, it has the ability to support very high definition displays. The overall horsepower and computational capability of Kal-El is about 5x the performance of Tegra 2 and has some really exciting new technologies for extremely low-power operations even though we have four CPUs inside our Kal-El processor. These are all the breakthroughs that we have demonstrated at Mobile World Congress. Whereas some of the competitors seemed panicked to announce something on their PowerPoint slides, we tend to announce the product when we're actually sampling to customers. And in the case of Kal-El, we're now sampling to our strategic partners and our intention is to go to production this year. With respect to the importance of quad core, obviously, quad core is incredibly important otherwise it wouldn't be on all of the suppliers' road maps. We were the first in the world to announce and ship dual core. During that time, a lot of people asked us about that, and now it's quad core. If you think about the tablet or mobile device applications, you'll realize that very quickly it's multitasking. You're multitasking whether you're streaming music, while you're reading a book or you're playing game and you're being connected to other players in a multiplayer environment or you do physics processing while you're playing a game. One of the most delightful parts of the game that people like these days, whether it's Angry Bird or others, it's just the realistic physics that it does. And the way that the bricks and the buildings fall apart are physically real, and you're going to see more and more of that type of capability over time. And so whether it's multitasking, whether it's image processing for very high-quality camera effects, browsing, multitasking, those type of applications are all very, very intensive users of multi GPU cores. And the last thing is it's actually logical and completely intuitive if you think about it, but four CPU cores working less hard consumes less energy than one CPU core or two CPU cores working their butt off. And that's the reason why if you look at the PC industry, what people have said about the PC hitting the brick wall and hitting the power wall. Remember when CPUs were cranking at extreme high frequencies, those are just bad ideas. Brute forcing CPU design and overclocking it and causing it to run extremely fast is just not a very good idea. It makes a lot more sense to run at the natural frequencies of the semiconductor process and utilize all kinds of parallels and ideas. In the case of CPUs, we have four cores. In the case of a GPU, we have 12 cores. Using parallelism is the most efficient and also the highest performance approach to computing that we know.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: In terms of the economics, will you get it by 28 nanometers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, 28-nanometer is not available yet, so it's not an option this year. On the other hand, 40-nanometer is actually more economical than 28 nanometers this year and we\u2019ll likely expect it to be so until about first half, maybe even the midpoint of next year. So 40 nanometers is absolutely the right approach. It is the most mature, and we can go into very, very high production very, very quickly because the yields are so great.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava. [BMO]\nEmily Scudder: This is Emily calling in for Ambrish. For the Tegra business, can you comment on the mix of that between smartphones and tablets today and where you see that as we exit the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it's hard to tell because it depends on how many smartphones and tablets our partners sell. And so it's really, really hard to tell. I mean, one of the things that we all have to recognize is the market for tablets is much, much larger than we all expected. And every single time an analyst comes out with another projection for the size of the tablet market it gets bigger, and I think there's a couple of reasons for that. They're just wonderfully delightful to use. They're easy to carry around and you see more and more people now carrying around tablets surely instead of -- I've never seen anybody carry a netbook around. But you\u2019re seeing more and more people carry tablets around than notebooks. And also, even if you have a PC, you don't mind buying a tablet to supplement it. If you already have a PC, it's not likely you'd buy another PC. But you surely would buy a tablet to supplement it. So I think it's an easy purchase. It's easy to use and delightful to use. And so I think people are surprised by the size of the tablet market. My sense is that we're going to continue to be surprised by the size of the tablet market, certainly as more and more capabilities come out. One of the things that we're really excited about is that these tablets are now completely Flash accelerated. And so you can go to any website, you could run any application off the web that you\u2019d expect to. And so those kinds of new usage capabilities and this freedom to explore capability is something that we're quite excited about. And so it's hard for us to tell right now. The thing that I can tell you is that our design wins are all Tier 1s. These are the marquee names of the mobile industry and computing industry and have a great deal of faith in their ability to create exciting products and taking them to market. And so we'll just have to wait and see and see how it turns out.\nEmily Scudder: And then within the GPU segment, can you comment on your expectation for ASPs on desktops and notebooks as the Sandy Bridge systems are rolled out?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our ASPs, it depends on two factors. On the one hand, most of the notebook ASPs are going to be lower than the GTX 580 and 570 to 560 we just recently rolled out. On the other hand, the GTX 570 and 560 are still ramping. And so it's hard to say exactly how it's going to play out. We're just going to have to report on the progress as we go. We're excited about the gamers market. The gamers market has three catalysts this year. One, there's some really, really big titles for PC gaming coming out. Crysis 2 is just really, really exciting. And so I think the enthusiasts come out when there is a great new breakthrough games like Crysis. The second thing is, it's been a long time since the PC gamers had a basic platform of great opportunity. Sandy Bridge is the best CPU that's been built for PC gamers in a long, long time. And so we have SLI motherboards with Intel. We have SLI motherboards with ASUSTeK, with Gigabyte, with many others, so that gamers can upgrade their PCs with affordable, very low power and very high-performance systems. And so when Sandy Bridge starts to ramp and the SLI motherboards start to ship here in the near future, we're going to have to see how many people come up for the upgrade. And then the lastly is 3D Vision. When you can enjoy everything in 3D, it's just much more exciting. And 3D Vision basically doubles the resolution one for each eye, doubles the resolution that is needed to enjoy a game. And so that tends to drive higher-end ASPs. And so we're just going to have to wait and see before we can tell for sure.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Harlan Sur. [JPMorgan]\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Within your guidance for the first quarter, can you just give us a sense directionally about the quarter-on-quarter revenue trends for your three different segments?\nDavid White: Well, Harlan, this is David. On the desktop side, typically, we see some seasonality in there in the first quarter. That will probably be modest for the business. Our notebook business is going to grow very nicely in Q1 primarily as a result of the Sandy Bridge platforms we'll be shipping in the quarter. And we expect, obviously, Tesla and Tegra to continue growing in helping drive our revenue growth going into the new fiscal year.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then I think you said in your earnings release that you expect Quadro to grow again in the first quarter as well.\nDavid White: Yes, that's correct.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, great. And then one more question, if I may. On Tegra, obviously, the team has a rapid ramp ahead of them and I think the concern with anything associated with the mobile and retail space is: how do you monitor sell-through to the end markets and to consumers and then to kind of triangulate that with the orders that you're getting from your handset and your tablet customers. So maybe you can take us through how the team plans to keep a close eye on sell into to your customers versus sell-through to the end markets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the way I would look at that is in our larger businesses like Quadro and GeForce, we put a lot of energy into monitoring sell-outs and sell-throughs. And the reason for that is because we're such a large position in the marketplace. Tegra is a brand new product for us, and we have almost zero exposure in the mobile industry and this is really our first major push into it. And the devices that we're in are not fringe or exotic devices. They're not Transformer-type devices or new 3D displays where people aren't sure yet whether those adoption are going to be quite high or not. These are straight-down-the-middle, high-end and where-the-demand-is-the-greatest superphone devices right now. And as you see from the devices, they're beautiful and they're the primary platforms for the marquee customers that we're working with. It is core to their business. These aren't fringe products. And so I think that from that perspective, I have a relative amount of confidence that our partners are going to do a great job marketing them. And the enthusiasm in the marketplace is already really, really high and the reviews have been great. So my sense is that we're going to do quite well. As we get to be a much larger player in the mobile space, we're going to have to develop those kind of systems that we use for the PC industry where we monitor sell-throughs and sell-outs. And so we'll have to have to continue to do a better job with that. But at the moment, I think that we're going into, I guess, what people will consider blue ocean [ph].\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Doug Freedman. [Gleacher & Company]\nDoug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Last quarter, you mentioned that you thought that Tegra could actually be above your chipset business. Would you care to comment on if that occurred or not?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It did not occur this quarter. It will occur next  quarter.\nDoug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Would it be possible for you to rank your product segments by gross margin so we can sort of get a sense of where the gross margin benefits are really coming from?\nDavid White: So Doug, as we've talked about previously, our Professional business, which includes both Quadro and Tesla, are our highest margin businesses for the company, and below that would be Tegra and our desktop, notebook business, below that.\nDoug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Tegra and then, I'm sorry, the desktop is...\nDavid White: Our desktop and notebook businesses, which are below our company average.\nDoug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Would desktop be above notebook?\nDavid White: Yes.\nDoug Freedman - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then when we look at some of the OpEx number, it looks like this quarter, you're planning on OpEx growth. It looks a little bit above the revenue guided, especially if we were to strip out the $22 million royalty payment. Can you comment on what we should think about for OpEx both in Q1 and throughout the balance of the year given the need to support all these Tegra programs?\nDavid White: Well, as we included in the CFO commentary, a lot of what's driving -- really the two largest components that are driving operating expense really are the fact that our stock price has gone up and that's driving stock-based compensation. And the other piece is hiring and engineering support materials and so forth for all of the products that we're launching. We will -- some of those investments that we're making and are coming in Q1, precede revenue that we hope to realize later on in the year as we see Tesla and Tegra and our other pieces of our business ramping. As it relates to $327 million, that which I think was what we guided for Q1 and how that's going to behave going forward, we won't have, for example, payroll tax for the full year and so forth. So that will naturally go down and some other expenses will offset that. But I wouldn't expect it to be appreciably higher going through the year when you net all those things out.\nJen-Hsun Huang: And I think it's inappropriate to not include royalties as a part of our ongoing business. There's several businesses in our company where royalties is the natural way for us to engage our customers. And it does require innovation and engineering invention for us to benefit from those royalties. And so I think the two go hand-in-hand, and it's not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t split it out. I would expect it to be an ongoing part of our business going forward.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Raj Seth. [Cowen and Company]\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jen-Hsun, a question on Tegra. You talked before about chip IC companies having to become much more systems aware. I'm curious when you engage with key partners like HP, can you talk a little bit about how much system-level software integration you're doing? How much they're doing? And does your engagement model differ from your competitors in any way?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're actually not engaged with HP. So you chose one that we're not actually...\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: I'm sorry, yes, forgive me. But any of your key partners.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The answer is in the mobile space. There's just a lot of system software to do. And developing multimedia and system software technology is one of the areas where we just have an enormous amount of expertise because of building sophisticated computers over the years. And if you look at the PC, the amount of systems software we had to do for it is every bit now the same in the mobile industry, if not more. And that's one of the reasons why we believe that mobile computing was going to be such a great opportunity for us. That on one hand, the modem will continue to be important. On the other hand, for certain classes of devices, whether it's the superphones or tablets, its computing capability is one of the most important things. And in order to deliver on a great computing experience, the ability to create all of the system software from video to graphic to multitasking to all of the Flash accelerations and just the enormous amount of OpenGL or whatever it is and computer vision and imaging software, all of that kind of software working together in a just a really wonderful experience is hard to pull together. And this is something that we believe we have a great deal of expertise and a great deal of capacity to do. So we do quite a large amount of it. We know our architecture best. This is an area that in terms of system software, few companies in the world has a very large capacity to do. The three companies that probably have the largest capacity in the world of system software, it's probably us, Intel and AMD because of all the computers that we built over the years. We just have more people in system software with this expertise than just about anywhere else in the world. And so I think that this is something that is of great importance and is becoming more and more important and a greater and greater bottleneck. And we talked about early reviews of Tegra 2 phones, some of the comments that people are making are its stability and the performance of these phones right off the chute. Most of the smartphones that you may have bought, with the exception of Apple's products frankly, you've had to debug into existence. And you know, we think that that's not inherent to a phone. It's just because it\u2019s inherent to building great computers. And so I think this is an area of great differentiation for us.\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: Can I ask a follow up if I might? So this is one of the differentiators. You've got a very aggressive road map that you showed on Tegra. As we move forward, what are the key differentiators other than what you just talked about in the tablet market and handset market from your perspective? And over time, given the integration trends, at least in the handset market, is the lack of baseband and conductivity a material constraint or not for you in your view?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Computing is a very large space. And although these mobile devices are starting to do more and more computing, the computing capability that we're looking at is still rather nascent. The benefit that we have is, and we described it at Mobile World Congress, the benefit that we have is that the rich and deep pipeline of intellectual property that we can bring to bear as mobile devices become more and more computing capable. We went from a company that was working on basically one and a half to two mobile chips to a company that now has five chips on the road map. And we're concurrently working on projects that go all the way out to 20 nanometers and beyond. We don't have to wait for anyone to create the computing technology for us to license. We have all the technology here for us to bring to bear and execute a really aggressive road map. And that's how we're able to year-in, year-out crank out leading edge products that as the rest of the industry is just putting it and talking about it on paper. With respect to modems, there are quite a few modem players in the world. I mean, you'd be surprised how many of them there are. I mean, Qualcomm is obviously a supplier. Infineon is a supplier. ST-Ericsson is a supplier. There are many others. And where our focus is on the segments of the marketplace where computing is really important. And we believe that there's a great deal of work that we could do here before we need to consider increasing levels of integration. And then lastly, both the computing side and the modem side are going through very rapid innovation at the moment. On the one hand, computing is going from dual core to quad core and more and more GPU performance and better and better video capability and such. And on the other hand, modems are going from 2.5G to 3G to 4G. And so all of these are moving parts. Integration is the enemy of innovation. And so it's hard to move as fast when you have to integrate everything into one chip.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Vijay Rakesh. [Sterne Agee]\nVijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Just wondering, when you look at your Tegra and obviously, it's ramping in a lot of multiple tablets here. What is the breakout in Q4, and how do you see that in Q1 and Q2? If you would give us some more color on that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: In Q4, we just barely started shipping the early production ramp of the first partners. In Q1, we will be in quite significant production on across many of the OEMs. It's going to be quite a big step up.\nVijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: And then just to take a step back, you had guided Tegra -- what is your guidance for your side for Tegra for the year? And are you seeing any change on the upside or downside here as you\u2019ve gone through that for a couple of quarters and the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have not guided Tegra for the year. Probably, the new piece of information about Tegra is Kal-El going to production this year. I don't think anybody expected us to announce that. I don't think anybody expected us to have a road map that was this aggressive and it was a surprise to all of our competitors and was even a surprise to many of our customers. And so all of our partners are in re-tooling mode right now in road maps so that they can catch up to us on Kal-El. So I'm excited about the second half of the year as the tablet market continues to develop and as we go into Kal-El. So that's the new piece of information that I think very few people realize and consider.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tim Luke. [Barclays Capital]\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital: I was wondering, as you look at the revenue momentum having had a strong uptick into April as you start the Tegra ramp, do you feel that, that sort of rate of growth may be sustainable through into the July period? Or is it to some extent that you\u2019ve have a big near-term lift associated with the initial supply into the channel? And I was wondering, Jen-Hsun, if you could have any framework associated with the expectation of the timelines that you could talk about Tegra 3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, we\u2019ve barely shipped anything. So Tegra 2 has just barely gone into production. In terms of thinking about these things, the growth and the growth opportunities, really the only thing you can really keep in mind is the size of the opportunity and the partners that you have to address those opportunities. The size of the tablet opportunity\u2019s obviously larger than anybody expected. And I think people are getting a firmer grip on why the tablet is such a wonderful computing device. Secondly, I think the partners that we are going to market with it are undoubtedly the best in the world. If we have to choose the best Android partners in the world to go to the market with, I think we couldn't have chosen a better list. So I think we're going to be able to address a very large market and address it with partners who could give us a global reach. With respect to future Tegras, I'm not sure if there was an exact question. But I haven't used the word Tegra 3 yet, but we demonstrated recently a processor called Kal-El, it's an internal code name for a next generation processor. We haven't figured out -- we haven't decided yet what the market name is going to be. It is intended to be in production in Q3.\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital: And just for David, on OpEx if I may, having seen the guidance move up around the $25 million in the April quarter, do you think that the rate of growth in OpEx through the next several quarters to support the customers is likely to be in a similar range? Or do you think that the magnitude of sequential increases could be somewhat lower?\nDavid White: Tim, I think the magnitude quarter-over-quarter after Q1 should be much lower. You got two step functions that kind of impacted Q1. One was the restart of payroll taxes, which is pretty binary. And then second one is just the recent run-up in our stock has caused our stock-based compensation to go up quite handedly as while. And so we'll have to wait and see what happens to stock price, but certainly the FICA won't be going and getting reset again. And I think in terms of our controllable expenses in terms of engineering, materials and rents and all those things, people cost and so forth, I wouldn't expect it to be rising as much as it did from Q4 to Q1.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Patrick Wang. [Wedbush]\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Securities Inc.: David, you're going to get a nice lift in gross margins over the course of this year due to your royalty payments. I was hoping you could talk about gross margins over time and perhaps how to think about that as your royalties steps up into the July quarter and beyond.\nDavid White: Well, the royalty or license fee from Intel will contribute 2.5 to 3 points of gross margin starting in the second quarter. If you hold that out and you just look at our core business, gross margins there should also be increasing through the year as well, particularly as Tesla and Tegra products ramp and I think even as our desktop business, our high-end GTX 560, 70 x and 80 \u20ac products, continue to gain momentum out in the marketplace. So certainly, we see a path for our margins being well into the low 50s sometime during the year.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Securities Inc.: I mean, if I just do a little bit of math there, it should almost be conceivable that you could exit the year at something in the mid-50s. Is that just unrealistic?\nDavid White: We'll just have to wait and see. We've got a lot -- second half of the year has got a lot of unknowns at this point particularly in some of our new businesses. So we certainly like to think that we'll have a very nice back-end of the year and that\u2019ll contribute to margin uplift, we'll just have to wait.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Cassidy. [Stifel, Nicolaus]\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Jen-Hsun, you had mentioned -- staying with this 40 nanometers, I wonder, could you tell me more about what went into that decision process? Was it time to market or is it even your customers\u2019 requests? I guess I just wanted to understand that a little more.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, 28 nanometers is not available this year, not until the very end of the year. And I think for us to ship production out in Q3, we have to start wafers in early Q2, right? And so 28 nanometers is not an option. Secondarily, 40 nanometers is now in the third year of its production, and the yields are fabulous. And so that's a wonderful reason to do it. And so I think on the one hand, 28 nanometers is available, on the other hand 40 nanometers yielding fabulously. So I think it's just naturally the right answer. But going forward, the way to think about it is the general rhythm that you will see in the industry for companies that come up with new processors every year, you should expect to see two processors in the same node or so. You\u2019ve noticed other companies that have used different ways of explaining the rhythm and some use a one process node change, one is a architecture change, the next one is a process node change. So basically, it's every other year for a new process node. And I think that rhythm is not a bad rhythm. I mean, that's basically how quickly the industry is changing process. So it stands to reason that Tegra 2 and Tegra Next or Kal-El would use the same process, and then the following ones would be a 28-nanometer deal.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shawn Webster. [Macquarie]\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: A couple of questions. On Tegra, is there a breakeven run rate that you guys need for you to be breaking even on an operating margin basis now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The answer is it's hard to predict and the reason for that is this: more and more of our company is involved in the Tegra road map. So as quickly as Tegra is growing, more of our company's overall R&D is driving into the Tegra road map. And it's because it's great for mobile devices, smartphones, tablets and because of Microsoft's announcement with Windows.Next running on ARM, all of a sudden Tegra has the ability to address front and center dead-on the core notebook PC market. And I think that the opportunity to take future generation Tegra processors directly into the notebook market is really exciting to me. And it's also a way for the PC industry to really be revolutionized, if you will, with industrial designs that are exquisite in battery life and usage models that are very, very different than today's notebook. I mean, I think it's pretty clear at this point that in the future, Windows notebooks will make today's notebooks look a little bit like refrigerators. And I think that we have the ability to completely revolutionize how people see notebook computers again, and I'm excited about that. And so how much of our engineering should really go into Tegra and related, Denver plus Tesla? The answer is a lot. And so the breakeven point could eventually become all of NVIDIA.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: And switching gears, I love the Superman analogy for Kal-El by the way. But on your core GPU and chipset business, what is the size of the chipset business for you guys today, just to get a sense of the trajectory where we're sitting now and as we evolve for the next couple of quarters? And then also, can you share with us what your GPU units did sequentially for Q4?\nDavid White: So on the MCB business, Shawn, I think we've talked previously about that business roughly running its course for the most part through the first half of this fiscal year, fiscal '12. And then in the second half of the year, it should be a pretty minor piece of our business. We've not really broken it out beyond that other than to say at least at this point, we know that Tegra will exceed it in Q1. And as far as units are concerned, our units were up in the fourth quarter, primarily on the strength of our mainstream business. But more importantly, the revenue per unit, or the ASP as someone asked earlier, was driven primarily by our mix changes. And we're happy to see that. It drives a lot of earnings potential for the company and opportunity for the company, and we don't right now see that changing materially going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of James Schneider. [Goldman Sachs]\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Related to Tegra 2, in Q1, could you share with us what you think your ASPs are today in that product and where do you think that they'll be? As we exit the year, do you think they'll be down or maybe even up given the mix of Kal-El?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let me just give you some directional input. Our ASP is for tablets because the package is larger and the bin tends to be a little higher. Tablet margins or ASPs are higher than that of smartphones. Smartphones are also designed into depending on which tier of the customers we engage with, extremely high-volume engagements or moderate volume engagements, those ASPs tend to be lower than tablets. And Kal-El, as the world's first quad core, would command a premium when the product comes out. And so those are kind of the directional levels and we haven't broken it up much further than that.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And maybe as a follow up, could you address your notebook GPU share as we head through this year? I mean, clearly, you're gaining share on the Sandy Bridge platforms. Do you think that it kind of steps up in Q1 and Q2 and then kind of plateaus as we head throughout the back half of the year? Or do you think that's more of a gradual continuing ramp throughout the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Most of that depends on how quickly Intel is going to transition Sandy Bridge relative to Huron River, I think, was the last platform. If Intel gets aggressive with Sandy River (sic) [Sandy Bridge], of course our share on Sandy River is much, much higher than that of Huron River. As you recall, our market -- we lost market share on Huron River with the first Fermi generation. But the GTX 5, the GTX 4 to 5 family, the second generation Fermi, has been a huge success for us. From desktop to notebook, we have the best stack of GPUs in the world today. And so the more aggressively Intel transitions from Sandy River to Huron River, the more quickly we will gain share. So partly it depends on them.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glen Yeung. [Citi]\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: I think somebody quoted a Gartner number for tablets in 2014. When you think about a number that big, what do you think is a realistic target for NVIDIA's market share in that business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, who knows? 2014 is a long time from now. I think there's a couple things that we believe in. We believe that computers are going to become thinner and thinner and easier and easier to use. And touch is going to become an increasing important part of computing. And so it stands to reason that tablets or notebooks that can become tablets or tablets that can become notebooks, that these are going to become, if you will, kind of part of computing. It will become the PC. And what we consider a tablet today, but if you look at some of the way people are thinking about it, I think about it as just personal computers. This is the new personal computer, and they are just different form factors. There're smaller versions of tablets, we call them smartphones or superphones. There are larger versions of tablets, we call them notebooks. There are even super-large versions of tablets, if you will, all-in-one PCs. And so I think that you're going to find the industrial design of personal computers has become disrupted, if you will, as a result of mobile computing components being used and mobile computing processors being used. And so I think that the space of personal computers, tablets, smartphones are going to become a little bit fuzzy over time. Even the OEMs that provide them will become fuzzy over time. And it stands to reason that at this point, I think we all believe it's a very large market. Now to be successful within that large market, it's important that you have a very low power design. It's important that you have the ARM processor. The ARM ISA has now become the de facto standard of this segment of the market and it's become very disruptive. It is the only ISA now that can support all of the major operating systems necessary for the mobile computing space. From iOS to QNX to Android to now next generation Windows. So it's clear that you need to have ARM. And then after that, you need to have expertise in building computers. An SoC is basically a computer on a chip. And when you are a provider of a computer-on-a-chip and there are this many operating systems to support, you better have deep, deep expertise and not to mention capacity of system software expertise in building sophisticated computers like this. And so I think that at the very high level, it's really exactly how we think about our strategy. That this is a very large market. It is disruptive. It is disrupting the computer industry as we see it and know it right now. And this is an area where we believe we can play at a great deal -- make a great contribution and drive our growth. So aside from that, it's kind of hard to predict exactly whether Gartner is going to be right or not. My guess is based on where the analysts' predictions have been going lately, it seems like every month they've been raising their estimates. And so we don't know where it stops.\nOperator: And your final question is from the line of Craig Berger. [FBR Capital Markets]\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: On the GPU business, a, is there an impact in the April quarter from the Intel Sandy Bridge delay, meaning, is production being held up? And then, b, where is your notebook market share now and where do you expect it to go? And then as part of that, do you think Sandy Bridge is going to take any overall GPU share?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Number one, we have not experienced a disruption so far, and people are still running as hard as they can. They paused but I think Intel is doing quite a good job of helping everyone recover. With respect to share, I think our share is about 40% today. My guess is that when it's all said and done, our share should be north of 60%. And then with respect to attach rate, the PC industry still has basically to two tiers: the basic PC and the premium PC. If every PC uses basic Intel integrated graphics then everything would be the same and everything would become a VCR. But obviously, no consumer would like that because they still believe that there's an opportunity to buy a better PC and one that has higher performance or higher resolution or just more interactivity or the fact that our GPU\u2019s just far, far, far more compatible with games and all the multimedia applications. So it depends on how you want it -- what you use it for. If you're a person looking for a basic PC, then integrated graphics makes sense for you. And you're looking for a premium PC and buy something a little bit better with the money you have, adding a GPU to it is really a fabulous thing. And so that basic dynamic hasn't really changed with the introduction of Sandy Bridge. So I'm not expecting a much GPU attach differences.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: One quick follow-up. You guys said you did about $100 million of Tesla this year. Do you care to throw out a number that we should dial into our models for 2011?\nDavid White: It's hard to say, but we should grow very nicely this year. We'll give you more guidance as we get closer to it.\nOperator: And no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?\nMichael Hara: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking with you about our Q1 results.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

One final note, our annual shareholders meeting is next week on May 19. For the first time, shareholders will be able to vote and ask questions online during the meeting, and please see our website for more information. With that, let's begin. We are back in the high end of the Enthusiast segment. In April, we shipped our GeForce GTX 480 and 470 GPUs, the first products based on our next-generation QGPU [ph] architecture code name Fermi. The GeForce GTX 40 and 470 GPUs were designed from the ground up to excel at tessellation, the defining the feature of DirectX 11. Geometric fidelity is one of the most important new looks for the next-generation graphics. So instead of just being compatible with DX11, we created a DX 11 tessellation monster. GTX 480 is 8x faster than the competition. Reception for the new GeForce 400 series amongst gamers and press has been phenomenal. Just last week, the GTX 480 was validated as the fastest GPU on the world when KIngpIn and Shamino, two world-class overclockers, used the 480 to break world records on the Futuremark 3DMark Vantage Hall of Fame.  GTX 480 is DX11 done right. Bjorn3D stated, \"The GTX 400 lineup eats tessellation and ray tracing for breakfast, and has the advantage in every benchmark in game using those technologies so far as it's not a hard call.\" Futurelooks.com wrote, \"There is no question that the NVIDIA GTX 480 is the king of tessellation. The GTX 400 series GPUs also provide a significant higher computational capability, which will allow game developers to increase the level of physx realism via our PhysX API. With our leadership position in DX11, combined with the incredible experience in the PhysX and 3D Vision provide, we expect to take back share in the Enthusiast segment.  In the first quarter, we shipped a few hundred thousand units as yields have exceeded our expectations. The 480 and 470 are widely available worldwide and continue to sell out on a weekly basis. More importantly, being back in the Enthusiast segment is a positive driver of revenue and profitability growth.  We began shipments of the new GeForce 320M integrated chips at the Apple for the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 320M delivers up to an 80% performance increase over the previous GeForce 9600M integrated chipset. In addition, the new 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro both come standing with the new GeForce GT 330M, the fastest graphics ever in a Mac notebook. In addition, the 15- and 17-inch notebooks come with switchable graphics. It's another powerful example of how switchable graphics is quickly becoming a standard requirement in notebooks. We now have approximately 70 Optimus design wins, in which 11 are in production today and 50 are expected to be available in the market and ready for this year's back-to-school cycle. We continue to believe that Optimus has the potential to expand the market for discrete GPUs by increasing the GPU attach rate in notebooks. Our Quadro business continues to recover and in fact, is ahead of where we anticipate it would be at this time. The recession delayed the upgrade in 2009, and with the significant enhancement made in both hardware and software within that timeframe, we believe it will drive a more aggressive upgrade cycle.  For example, Adobe CS4 penetration was well behind CS3 due to the recession, creating meaningful pent-up demand for CS5. We are anticipating that the combination of a healthy upgrade cycle and the addition of new markets will take our Quadro business to a higher level of growth. During the first quarter, we announced that the range of NVIDIA Quadro Professional Graphics Solutions are certified for Adobe, for Adobe Creative Suite 5 software, which provides realtime video entertainment effects processing with Adobe Premier Pro CS5. This version of Adobe Premiere Pro leverages the parallel processing architecture of NVIDIA GPUs via the new Adobe Mercury Playback Engine to allow users to create compelling, multi-layer projects and preview them in realtime. Tesla achieve record revenue, and Q1 should be the first of many record quarters to come. Fermi has unlocked new demand for Tesla. We are experiencing heightened activity in a number of areas such as supercomputing, energy and finance. The most significant leading indicator of Tesla's long-term success is the adoption of Tesla as a standard OEM SKU. A number of OEMs including Supermicro, Apro, Tyan, Cray and Bull have already announced the OEM servers with more Tier 1s to follow. Finally, we achieved a major milestone this quarter. We completed and qualified our first commercially available smartphone. Today, Microsoft is shipping the industry's first phone based on Tegra. We are now the first PC technology company in history to cross the chasm from computing to mobile computing. We continue to watch this space. We have multiple next-gen Tegra designs within smartphones and tablets coming which will be announced later this year. Our core profit drivers high-end GPUs and professional solutions are performing well. And with evidence from a number of key early indicators for our growth businesses discussed today, we continue to be optimistic of our prospects in 2010 and beyond.  With that, let me turn the call over to David.\nDavid White: Thanks, Mike. Q1 was another good quarter, driven by the ongoing recovery of enterprise spending, the shipment of Fermi-based products for desktop GPU and high-performance computing, new product ramps at Apple and a very strong notebook market. Revenue was $1.0 billion, up 2% sequentially. Our GAAP gross margin was 45.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $309 million and GAAP net income was $137.6 million or $0.23 per diluted share. The core GPU business was flat quarter-over-quarter. Supply constraints are finally easing. In particular, yields of our high-end, Fermi-based GPUs were much higher than expected, leading to good availability of our new GeForce GTX 480 and 470 GPUs and Tesla high-performance computing products. Quadro grew strongly once again and is now approaching pre-recession levels. Tesla had a record quarter, which together with our Quadro business, contributed to higher overall gross margin in the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.76 billion, up $36.7 million from the fourth quarter. Our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2011: Revenue is expected to be down seasonally, 3% to 5%; GAAP gross margin is expected to increase to 46% to 47%; GAAP operating expenses are expected to be flat; our tax rate of 12% to 14%, assuming a renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit and otherwise a tax rate of 14% to 16%.  That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes the line of Tim Luke of Barclays Capital.\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital: If I may, could you guys elaborate on your comments associated with the increased availability of capacity, particularly on the high-end nodes? And also, your comment with respect to yields, on how you believe that may begin to impact your margin profile going forward?\nDavid White: Yes, Tim. You'll recall that back in the fourth quarter and earlier times of last fiscal year, when we were ramping other products and the 40 nanometer node, we had many challenges with yields and our ability to supply the market with adequate product. And we really hit kind of a turning point, somewhere at around the December, January timeframe where we began seeing predictable improvements, and those improvements continued throughout the first quarter. And this being the first quarter that we launched Fermi, those wafer starts were done some time ago is a time when margins weren't as good as what they actually wound up being. And so our margin progression wound up exceeding our expectations. A result of exceeding expectations, we wound up having more die available to sell. Now given that Fermi only launched in the last three, four weeks of the quarter, there's only so much capacity you've got in the line when you exceed expectations like that. And we ship everything we can get to the back end, and that contributed to certainly, the quarter on margins. And going forward, we expect Fermi to continue to be an important element of our product mix. And as a result of that, you see our guidance of gross margin going up quarter-over-quarter as a result.\nTimothy Luke - Barclays Capital: Your gross margin obviously going up with the revenue slightly down. The key catalyst for that is the Fermi ramp, is it? Or are there other elements that you might be able to elaborate on just on the strength of the gross margin in the coming quarter?\nDavid White: Well, Fermi's a substantial piece of that. I mean our Tesla business is still continuing to grow, and so it'll become a bigger piece of the mix as well. But largely, it's Fermi and Fermi and Tesla, as well as Fermi and graphics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Wedbush Morgan.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Securities Inc.: I was just hoping I could comment. When we look at your revenue guidance, you're down 3% to 5%. I know that you think that, that's actually in line with the seasonality here, but what are some of the moving parts behind that because, I mean, clearly, we're starting to see -- Tegra is starting to ramp a bit here. I just want to get some of your thoughts just in terms of the Workstation, GeForce and maybe even some color on Chipsets?\nDavid White: Well, our Chipset business is doing well. As Mike mentioned in his comments, we launched the 320M this last quarter. That product, we expect to be shipping for quite a period of time. So that business is actually doing very well right now. As it relates to the other elements and the seasonality you referred to, we experienced seasonality just like our competitors do in the industry, and we think our 3% or 5% down is consistent with what we typically experience. Now notwithstanding that, we're expecting Fermi to be very strong this quarter as we continue to ramp that product and actually have an opportunity to ship Fermi throughout the quarter, which we didn't obviously have the opportunities the last quarter. So that mitigates it to some extent, but overall, we feel our guidance is relatively consistent and the mix change will be a favorable to our earnings profile.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Securities Inc.: I just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of how you think market share is going to trend, given the supply dynamics you just given update on, what's your sense of the demand out there and of course, your competitive positioning?\nDavid White: Well, we haven't been in the high-end segment because of Fermi being delayed for over two quarters now, and so my expectation is that we're going to gain share. We gained share last quarter because of our increasing share in notebooks. Some of that could have been attributed to Optimus, and looking forward, we expect Optimus continue to gain adoption. So we're optimistic about Optimus. So between the desktop returning into the high end and continuing to do well in the Notebook segments, my sense is that our share should be rather healthy.\nPatrick Wang - Wedbush Securities Inc.: And I guess just the part of the demand, you're still seeing kind of seasonal demand here? Anything out of the ordinary?\nDavid White: For the core parts of the market, we're expecting seasonality. However, we're growing into with Fermi into the high-end segments that we've not have been in for a couple of quarters. So there's quite a bit of pent-up demand that we're seeing out there. So we're ramping as hard as we can and as fast as we can, and trying to keep up with the demands for our customers. So we're looking forward to getting back into the high end. But the rest of the business, we characterize this as mainstream business, should experience seasonality.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael McConnell of Pacific Crest Securities.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest: Jen-Hsun, last conference call, you talked about Fermi and it would be hitting full stride in Q2 and that would offset seasonality, you guys have guided now seasonal. Has there been any change, regionally speaking, with demand? Any impact maybe Europe? Or any impact with memory pricing that has led you guys to back off a little bit and guide seasonal for Q2?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we don't know anymore or any less about what's happening out in the larger market than anybody else. And there's, obviously, in the overall larger market, there are some concern about seasonality. But we are ramping Fermi as we had talked about before, and the success of Fermi is certainly as we expected. So when you see how it plays out here, I mean these are a couple of the -- with respect to Q2, those are the two dynamics that you're looking at. Seasonality on the one hand, on the other hand, we're ramping new products into a new segment that we've been out of for a couple of quarters, and so we'll see how it turns out.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest: And then just looking at the Mercury data for the last couple of quarters, I think your units, last two quarters combined, they're up about 77% in the notebook discrete space. Should we be kind of anticipating a pause here as we move into the summer? And could you talk about what's been driving that very strong growth that you've been seeing in the notebook discrete market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The biggest factor in the growth of discrete graphics is China. The China market is the fastest growing notebook PC market. It also happens to be the market where we have the highest adoption of discrete GPUs. We believe the reason for that is because the Chinese market is much more sensitive to reviews of products and they're much more -- the consumers scrutinize their purchasing decisions much more than elsewhere around the world, and they tend to be much more value conscious. I mean they will go out and buy what is the best performance per dollar versus what brand OEMs that it comes from. And so the GeForce adoption and the inclusion of GeForce is a huge factor for the Chinese market, and so we're seeing very good adoption in China. The GeForce brand is also really popular in China, and the reason for that is because the Chinese consumers spend a lot of time online, and video games is a big part of how they enjoy their computers. Video games and enjoying movies and multimedia is a big part of how people use PCs. And so that's probably the biggest factor for the growth of discrete GPUs. Now looking into the summer, we're expecting Optimus to be very successful. We've shipped, at this point, only a handful of Optimus notebooks and I think there are 70 or so projects in the pipeline, and we're expecting the vast majority of them to go into production for back to school. And so Optimus has turned out to have been a very big success for us, because the value proposition is just so clear. You get the benefits of the longest possible battery life when you're using light computing and whenever you use it, whenever you would like performance from your PC, Optimus instantaneously turns on the GPU and gives you amazing performance. And so having that uncompromising benefit in the PC and the notebook for the very first time has really resonated with the marketplace. So I'm hoping that our Notebook business continues to do well, and we'll see how it turns out.\nOperator: Our next question comes the line of Raj Seth of Cowen and Company.\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the handset opportunity for Tegra? David mentioned the Microsoft milestone, I guess I'm curious within your design win base, how many designs are in the pipeline when you're winning sockets? Why you're winning when you're losing? Maybe as importantly, why you're losing? Is it mostly Snapdragon you're seeing out there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're pretty excited about Tegra as you could imagine. Our first-generation strategy, we wanted to focus on one operating system. It was our new player in this marketplace, and we focused all of our energy around the Microsoft Zune and Microsoft Win Mobile, and I'm delighted with what we were able to build. It demonstrates that NVIDIA has created an architecture that's extremely low power while being very high performance, and that we know how to build phone processors. It's a big deal. It took us a long time to figure it out, and it's been a long-term investment, and so the Microsoft 10 and the Zune HD are the results of that first generation. On the second generation, we were able to expand to focus a lot of our energy around Android. And although it made sense for the first-generation androids to use available phone processors, the follow-on generations of Android are really going to go after performance. And iPhones are out there, the iPhone 4G is coming, the iPad is obviously a revolutionary product. The bar is pretty high for all of the mobile players, and so they need a processor that can keep up with the A4. If not, be much better than what the A4 can do because they have to take on the leader in the space. And so I think the second-generation Tegra has been doing incredibly well because Android is doing incredibly well. So we're going to come to market with the second-generation Tegra with the third-generation Android. And so that's our focus now, which is the -- and I think it comes together at the end of the year, and we've talked about smartphones, we've talked about tablets. We have a very large number of designs in pipe and flight, and so we're looking forward to starting in third quarter and fourth quarter, many design wins to show up in production.\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: So just to be clear in the third, fourth quarter back into this year, we'd begin to see NVIDIA-powered Android handsets on the market? Or that's when there'll be a slew of design sockets available for you?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, we've been already working on those design sockets.\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: And is it mostly Qualcomm that you're competing against?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Prior to Tegra, there are only two application processor companies out in the mobile space, right? Basically, it's Qualcomm and TI, and they both make wonderful application processors. Our differentiation and our contribution to the space is where multimedia, high resolution, snappy graphics is really necessary. And the first-generation smartphones had pretty low resolution displays. And so snappy graphics and high-performance multimedia and high resolution just wasn't as much of an issue. But as you know, with iPad and next-generation smartphones, resolution's a huge issue, and you need to have very snappy graphics with a 10x7 display, if not even bigger by that, even higher resolution than that. You're just not going to do that with a application processor that's not designed for that. And so that's our contribution and that's our differentiation and that's what people are seeking out in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Jen-Hsun, just to make sure that I understand your guidance. In the context of capacity and yield, should we assume that there are no constraints anymore and all the issues have been resolved?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think the comment that David was making is that the yield has improved a lot. And TSMC has done a fabulous job, improving the yields of 40 nanometer since August of last year when we first ramped it to now. The yield and the number of wafers that they're able to produce, compound it, has really helped a lot. And so I think that with respect to manufacturability of 40 nanometers, I think we're surely out of the woods. I think we can now officially say that. We are clearly out of the woods, and I think that's all David was trying to say. The 40 nanometers at TSMC is now a world-class node and the manufacturability of it is very, very good. And so we're delighted with the execution from TSMC and they've just done a fabulous job. With respect to overall capacity, with respect to supply, the challenge is that the more and more customers are getting into 40 nanometers as well. And so we certainly aren't swimming in 40 nanometers supply. I mean we are constrained here and there. I wish we had more Fermis. I wish we had more GPUs of all kinds. And so there is still not enough 40 nanometers supply for the entire world, and so I expect that the 40 nanometer supply will remain constrained for sometime.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So the guidance implies that there is some supply constraints that has not allowed you to meet demand? Or is it there's a balance between supply and demand and what you're seeing is just normal seasonality and that's why the guidance?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're seeing seasonality. Yes, we were pretty clear that Q2's guidance is seasonality. It's seasonality offset by the ramp of Fermi, and so we're not going to know how it all balances out until the end of the next quarter or end of this quarter. But those are the two factors, if you will, seasonality in the mainstream market and the ramp of Fermi into GeForce, into Tesla and into Quadro.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Last earnings call, you had alluded to the channel inventory and how it had come back up by a week to about five weeks. Where are we now on the channel inventory?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The channel inventory at the moment looks healthy, but you have to look at across all the geographies and you have to look at it across the segments. The biggest lever for Q2 for us is growing into the Performance segment that we've not been in for over two quarters. And so ramping into the Performance segment is just the number one most important thing that we need to do right now. And obviously, since we've not been in it for a couple of quarters, the channel inventory for Performance segment GPUs is very lean. And so we're going to be ramping into pent-up demand here for quite sometime.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: But there's no blended number that you would like to share with us?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't have anything to share with you right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Thomas Weisel.\nKevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research: I wonder if you could give a little more detail on the inventory, the new product that didn't get packaged? Or if you could just give a little more details on that?\nDavid White: Yes. Kevin, I think in the prior comments, and in the CFO commentary, we'd explained it really is associated primarily with GTX 470 and GTX 480. We ramped that product. We were favorably surprised with nicer yields than what we anticipated. And given the fact that our ramp was all occurring at the end of the quarter, there was just a limited amount of capacity we had at the back end to get everything out that we would've liked to have got now. And so when the quarter ended, we had some inventory of Fermi die that we need to package.\nKevin Cassidy - Thomas Weisel Partners Equity Research: And are you comfortable with this level? Or do you expect it'll come down next quarter? Or for a new product ramp, do you typically increase those inventory?\nDavid White: Well, as Jen-Hsun is saying, right now, channel inventory is very dry per product from us, particularly in the high end of the segment. Our inventory generally would normally be the same way on a new product ramp. But I think it'll stabilize pretty much over the quarter for us. And again, we'll see what the inventory is at the end of the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: Just to close on the inventory, should we assume that channel inventory did increase globally? And Dave, in terms of the outlook for inventory, did you just say that you expect it to be flat? Or up? Or slightly down, or...\nDavid White: No, I don't think I gave an indication other than the fact that we thought that inventory issues with Fermi at the end of the quarter would naturally work their way out as we fulfill demand in the channel and -- or other customers.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Shawn, the easiest way to think about the inventory situation is that we're ramping into Fermi, and we have a whole lot of ramping to do yet. The back-end cycle time, the amount of testing that we have to do for Fermi GPUs are longer than mainstream products because they're just much, much larger GPUs. The Fermi GPU, as you know, is some 3 billion transistors, and so there's a lot of testing to do in it. It takes longer to sort it. It takes longer to assemble it. It takes longer to test it. And then we do final system-level testing on the GPUs before we ship them. And so that entire back-end cycle time is many weeks. And so all of the dies that came out as we're ramping and you could imagine the curve on the ramp that we're ramping up right now, a lot of the die that came out of the fab we couldn't get through the back end before the end of the quarter, and so that's all part of inventory. Now of course we're ramping into a fresh new market and a fresh new product and there's a lot of pent-up demand, and so we just needed to keep the pressure on it and just keep cracking through it.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: And how much as a percentage of your GPU revenues was 40 nanometer this last quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Quite big, probably. Quite big.\nDavid White: It grew quite nicely. And when you look at Fermi coming into the mix, along with our other 40-nanometer products, it grew pretty sizably this quarter.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: And when you saw the yield upside, was that for across your whole range of 40 nanometer? Or was it pretty Fermi driven?\nDavid White: It was across the whole 40-nanometer range.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: Can you share with us trends in pricing for your core GPU business, either units or pricing sequentially?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our ASP trends should be going up because we're returning back to the high end part of the market for the first time in six months plus. And so I would expect our ASP to be trending up at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (sic) [Goldman Sachs Group].\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I was wondering if we could start off on the OpEx side for a second. David, I think OpEx picked up just a little bit in the quarter. Are there any events like legal spending or any litigation that would've cause OpEx to be up materially in the next couple of quarters? Or you're going to keep that as flat as possible?\nDavid White: Well, our objective is to be flat. That's what we consistently stated and so forth. When you look at our expenses, there are some expenses we can control and there are some expenses we can't control. And as you look at our opportunity expenses in the second quarter and the fact they are, like you said, modestly up. It really was a result of two things that were really not largely in our control. One of which has to do with employee exercises of stock options, where we have to pay payroll taxes on those as they exercise them. The second had to do with legal expenses, which you just mentioned. As you know, we have a case going on between ourselves and Intel right now. That's certainly in full swing of depositions and so forth, which is driving -- and discovery, which is driving a significant amount of legal expenses. But also, you have to add on top of that the fact that the FTC has an investigation going on as well. And that investigation is entirely outside of our control, but yet we have to support with depositions and discovery and so forth. And so those are the two things that are really driving our expenses. And considering that we're roughly at the peak of this, we don't see it tailing off this next quarter, which is why we guided flat.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Could you address why accounts receivable jumped so meaningfully in the quarter?\nDavid White: Well, we launched two products at the very end of the quarter, Fermi being one of them, right? And you launch those products at the end of the quarter, you end up with receivables that you collect on the next quarter. So its primarily all related to launch activities.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: So it's all the fact that the new products were still back-end loaded in the quarter?\nDavid White: We launched them at the end of the quarter, and hence, they are back-end loaded again at the quarter, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman of Broadpoint AmTech.\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech, Inc.: David, can you talk a little bit about where we are in the MCP ramp down? And how you guys are going to manage that ramp down? Is there any cost savings that will occur as those revenues go away?\nDavid White: Well, certainly, there's cost savings. What we've tended to do is we tended to redeploy resources in other areas of our business where we have other needs, in such areas as Computing and Mobile and so fourth. As it relates to the vector of MCP in terms of how it's doing and so forth, we've combined that business with GPU organizationally and also financially. And we've indicated that over time, we expect the MCP business to go down, and we expect the Discrete business to go up, and that is progressing according to plan. But as I said earlier, MCP is not ramping down. We launched our 320M product, and it's doing quite well. We expect it to continue to do well.\nDoug Freedman - Broadpoint AmTech, Inc.: If I was to move on and look at another segment of your business, the 3D Vision products seemed to be broadly accepted in the market. Can you give us an update on how that's going? What impact that could have to revenues and margins?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Margins are about corporate average right now. 3D Vision just had a record quarter. 3D Vision will likely have another record quarter, and followed by another record quarter is my guess. At this point, it's pretty clear to everybody just as the future of TV as 3D. The future of PCs is 3D. And so if you would like to have a gaming PC or a multimedia PC and it has 3D Blu-ray, certainly, it should come with 3D Vision or some 3D glasses that you can enjoy with. And so I think that this is going to become part of a standard offering of consumer PCs in the future. And so this is a great growth opportunity for us and one that we're really proud of.\nDavid White: Yes, Doug, I would just make one comment to add to Jen-Hsun's and that is you've got to sell a lot of glasses to change the needle here at NVIDIA. I think the more important thing is the impact that 3D has on our Graphics business and the fact there's the pull that it creates for our Graphics products. I think it'll have more impact there than it will necessarily in the glasses per se.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arnab Chanda of Roth capital.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: First of all, if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. It seems like as your mix improves, your gross margins continue to go high, in fact, it might be closer at an all-time high. Is that continue to occur as the mix improves? Or are we getting close kind of sort of peak here? And then I have one follow-up question.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we haven't guided to where we think ultimately we think our gross margins ought to be. But ultimately, NVIDIA's gross margins ought to be in the mid-50s to high 50s. That's really where we have to go, and the reason for that is because an increasing amount of our business is highly differentiated business where software, middleware and other peripherals are such a large part of it. And as we continue to grow our Quadro business, as we continue to grow our Tesla business, as we continue to grow our Tegra business, where software is just such a large part of it, my expectation is that, that the gross margins will continue to reflect that. For each one of the businesses that I just described, the gross margins are better than what we are as a corporate standard. 2/3 of our company's revenues come from businesses that I've just described, or profits come from businesses that I've just described even though it doesn't represent nearly that much of the total revenues. And so my sense is that over time, as those businesses grow, our margins ought to drift towards it. And mixed with mainstream GeForce business, which will continue to be competitive, I think that in overall average, north of 50% is logical for our company. And so we just have to get there. You know that, Arnab, we've been transforming our company step by step over the last three, four, five years. And moving away from just offering a vast chip to offering solutions and software that differentiates us and add a lot more value to our customers. Our 3D Vision, for example, that was just discussed, is a great example of that. It only works with GeForce, and so it brings a lot more value to GeForce. CUDA is another area of innovation, and it only works with GeForce. And so over time, between those kind of things and many, many examples that's related to Quadro and Tesla and Tegra, those value-added ideas that we bring to the marketplace will be valued, we'd hope.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: So I'm sorry, I'm not sure if I heard you correctly, did you say mid- to high-50s, not 40s? I'm kind of having a little bit of a shock here, so I just want to make sure. I can hear your story...\nJen-Hsun Huang: That's where we should be. And maybe another way of saying that is where we are right now should not be our peak, and we don't expect it to be our peak. And if the mix of our business continues to grow as you were referring to earlier, then they should naturally take us to above 50%, right? Tesla is above 50%. Quadro is above 50%. And so if those continue to grow, we should certainly expect our gross margins to grow.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: It seems like given you have all these new products ramping, shouldn't that offset seasonality? I mean, you're still guiding seasonally, when -- or is there something going on in the end market that makes you a little cautious? If you could give us a little qualitative view on that, that'd be great.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Q2 is Q2. And everybody has the same feelings about the overall market at the moment as we do, I guess. There's some amount of cautiousness, and there's some amount of enthusiasm. And so I think that for the mainstream part of our business to be seasonal and for us to drive growth through new products, I think that's sensible, and we're comfortable with the guidance. And if it turns out different at the end of the quarter, then we can all rejoice.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citigroup.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: A couple of quarters ago or even last quarter, you talked about the idea that you were under-shipping demand, and now you're guiding for normal seasonal in the July quarter. So that business that you were under-shipping, is that something that was sort of temporal, right? It was sort of associated with the timeframe that we're at. Or is that lost business to competition? Or how should we think about that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The market overall was pretty supply constrained on 40 nanometer, so I don't know that we lost anything to the competition. But I think some demand is perishable. I mean if you went to a PC store and you couldn't buy a PC, you buy probably something else or maybe you waited. But 40 nanometers was surely supply constrained, and we're still supply constrained in certain segments of that, of the 40-nanometer product line. But at the moment, we see the marketplace as being relatively balanced. And looking into Q2, parts of the market is going to be seasonal and parts of our business is going to be high growth. And so we're just going to have to see how it turns out at the end of the quarter.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: As we think about the evolution of Fermi across the larger price stacking at NVIDIA over the course of the next few quarters, how should we think about that? What's the pattern we should expect to see? When does Fermi sort of permeate the entire price stack?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are sampling Fermis from entry-level notebook all the way to supercomputer Fermis. So there are many versions that we're already sampling. So we're going to production with it as soon as our customers go into production.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: And will gross margins be affected as that spread -- hows the pattern of that coincide with the pattern of the sampling devices?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're guiding gross margins up next quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Berger of Friedman, Billings and Ramsey & Co. (sic) [FBR Capital Markets].\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I guess one question I have is as we look into the back half of the year, should we still be looking for normal seasonality despite the, I guess, the better than Q1? Meaning, said differently, is Q2 the kind of aligned with consumption, shipments here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The back half of the year -- as I look at the back half of the year, I see that we will have more Fermis in production. I see that Tesla, our GPU for servers, is going to ramp up substantially because of OEMs going into production. This is the first Tesla that has been designed standard into OEM servers -- into many, many OEM servers. I see that the second half, our expectation is that enterprise consumption is going to continue to grow, so Quadro will continue to grow. And I see that second half, our Tegra smartphone and tablets will go into production. So my sense is that the second half, couple that with seasonality, ought to be pretty good. And so we need to make sure that we're very thoughtful about continuously to improve our yields and ramping our production.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Next question on Tegra. It obviously was down seasonally quite a bit in the first quarter. When do some of those design wins kick in? Who are you really focusing on to drive second-half growth?\nDavid White: Craig, can I just correct you. Q1 for Tegra was not down. The segment that it was in was down, primarily related to other non-mobile businesses that we're looking into that consumer space, but Tegra was actually up quarter-over-quarter.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Can you tell us how much?\nDavid White: We really not. I think we've indicated in the past that when Tegra becomes meaningful, it works significant, we'll break it up. But at this point, it's still pretty small.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And then just the magnitude and timing of growth and maybe which customers you're really focusing on for the second half?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don't announce our customers' products. So we'll talk about that when we go into production in the second half. The thing that we would love to talk about is the products that have already gone into production and I'm delighted to see Microsoft's Kin get into production and all the innovative new products, the new features that they've brought to the marketplace and to new perspective in the mobile phone market. And so we're excited about that.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Last question on the Chipset side, I know you just launched some new product. Even though you're not splitting it out, do you still expect that segment to be flattish this year? Kind of when do you see the inflection point in revenues maybe beginning to fall off in that segment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We expect the Chipset business to do very nicely in the next 12 months at least.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna of JMP Securities.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: I know you mentioned the 330 [330M graphics] and the MacBook Pros and the benefits they bring. I'm also noticing in the Windows environment a pretty nice footprint for your Quadro product. Has Quadro in the mobile space been a meaningful driver to date? Is that improving? And is either 40 nanometer or Fermi coming in that line, improving the outlook for that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Quadro has a very, very large share of the overall Workstation market, both desktop and notebook. And the notebook is a new growth area for Quadro because just as we do love to bring our work home with us, so do people who design things. And so whether it's video editing, which a lot of people, a lot of video artists love to do it on their laptops, or designing tennis shoes to cars, the ability to bring their work wherever they go is a very important capability for them. And so we see more and more people both having a Workstation on their desks at work as well as being able to take it with them in their notebook. And in the future, we're expecting the server to be a big part of our Workstation business as well, Quadro into servers, either in the form of with the display or Tesla into servers as they're remote rendering capability is the new growth opportunity for us. More and more people would like to put their work in the cloud, and to be able to share that work and collaborate with people all over the world. And so we see those two drivers to continue to grow the Quadro market. But the notebook is a very important segment for us, and we have a very large footprint there and it's a market that I expect to continue to grow.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: You mentioned -- you say you don't pre-announce your customers' products, but you also highlighted a good road map for Fermi with its sampling. Could we see products or Fermi broaden its architecture as early as E3? Or is it more of a Computex, back-to-school type of timeframe?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Fermi for E3 -- well, Fermi is the name of the architecture, and it goes into three different product lines. The first one is GeForce, and that one is in large volume production now. We're ramping that very hard, and we've got a lot of ramping to do. Because we were late with Fermi, we were out of this marketplace for some six months to maybe eight months. And so there's a very large pent-up demand for high-end products out there. And so we need to grow that segment, go back into that segment as hard as we can. The second is Tesla, Fermi is used for GPUs as a server, and they're used for computational processors for supercomputers, oil and gas seismic analysis to financial risk calculations. And so that is also just had a record quarter, and our expectation is we'll have yet another record quarter. And then the third segment of Fermi is Quadro. Quadro is our workstation, our graphics solution, and it's used by people who create movies, make movies as well as design cars. And so those three products will launch in the appropriate customers and in the appropriate time.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Michael Hara. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hara: Thanks, everyone for joining us.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Rob Csongor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nRob Csongor: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call on annual and fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 results.  With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until February 22, 2012, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2013. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended October 30, 2011, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Unless or otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website or in the case of our fiscal year 2013 outlook, the reconciliation is posted on our Investor Relations website. With that, let's begin. After 5 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth, fourth quarter revenue was negatively impacted by the global disk drive shortage caused by the flooding in Thailand, which affected the mainstream GPU segment more than anticipated. Shipments by some PC OEMs were reduced, and higher disk drive prices constrained the ability of some PC OEMs to include a GPU in their systems. Additionally, the Tegra 2 mobile business declined more rapidly than expected ahead of devices based on the Tegra 3 processor ramping into production in the first quarter of calendar year 2012.  However, despite tough economic conditions and the exiting of our chipset business, NVIDIA recorded very good results for our full fiscal year 2012. First, our overall GP -- our overall business grew 33%, excluding the chipset business we've been exiting. Discrete GPUs, including GeForce, Quadro and Tesla grew sharply over the year. GPU attach rates remained strong at 53% of consumer PCs and 36% overall, according to Mercury Research data. A resurgent PC gaming market saw games like Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3 record over $1 billion in sales in their first week on the shelves. At the time of the launch of Battlefield 3, over 80% of gamers were below the recommended hardware specification to play the game, driving a significant increase in gamer GPU revenues over the year. Our Professional Solutions Business had a record revenue year driven by large adoption of the Fermi generation of Quadro workstation products, as well as growth in emerging design economies such as India and China. Our Tesla products were selected to power the world's fastest supercomputers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory's upcoming Titan supercomputer. In addition, we made major strides in speeding up GPU computing applications support and code porting through our open HPC and directives initiatives. And in one of our most important achievements for the year, we established a position in the mobile market. Tegra products captured share in Tier 1 tablets and smartphones. Over the course of the year, Tegra products shipped in 14 phones, 34 tablets and in 18 of the top 20 carriers. We designed and shipped 3 generations of Android devices. With Tegra 2, we were the first to ship dual-core mobile processors. And now with Tegra 3, we are the first to ship quad-core processors. The Tegra mobile processor has grown into a multi-hundred million dollar business. Looking ahead, while we anticipate continued negative effects from the hard drive shortage, we believe gaming demand will continue to be robust, driven by the combination of our next-generation Kepler architecture and new hit games, such as Mass Effect 3 and Diablo III, both highly anticipated PC games coming in early calendar year 2012. We believe that tax rates will continue to be stable, and that we are well positioned to grow notebook share with significant new notebook wins in the upcoming Ivy Bridge design cycle. We are excited about a number of recent announcements we made in the professional space, which we believe will transform the workstation. First, yesterday, we announced that NVIDIA has joined forces with HP to introduce the world's first of all-in-one workstation, the Quadro-based HP Z1 Workstation. The Z1 features a 27-inch display that snaps open like the hood of the car, so users can easily swap out parts and make upgrades without any tools required. This is the first and an entirely new category of professional workstation that we believe will tap market segments where space is a premium and users are unwilling to compromise performance.  Second, we announced Maximus, a breakthrough for the workstation industry. Maximus enables for the first time a single workstation to simultaneously handle real-time visualization and compute-intensive simulation, functions which previously required separate steps or separate systems. Design and creative professionals have longed for machine that could perform these functions simultaneously. Maximus includes a combination of Quadro and Tesla, unifying software technology and a rigorous certification process for professional applications. We believe Maximus will redefine the workflow in several segments and that workstations will increasingly shift with multiple GPUs. Meanwhile, Tesla continued to make headlines in computational science. In addition to a number of new supercomputer deployment announcements, we announced breakthroughs in research. Two of the most important supercomputers in the world were recently announced in Oak Ridge National Labs' Titan and the NCSA's Blue Waters, both Tesla-based. China -- Chinese researchers announced they had achieved a major breakthrough in the race to battle influenza by using NVIDIA Tesla GPUs to create the world's first computer simulation of a whole H1N1 influenza virus at the atomic level. With Tegra 3, we believe our mobile business is poised for renewed growth. In addition to the launch of the world's first quad-core tablet, the ASUS Transformer Prime, we announced tablets based on Tegra 3 from a number of key OEMs, including Lenovo, ZTE, Fujitsu and Acer. We also announced, together with ASUS, the world's first quad-core tablet priced at $249, the ASUS 7-inch MeMO ME370T. Next up, our Tegra 3 phones. We're looking forward to announcing some of the first ones at Mobile World Congress.  With innovating, exciting new tablets at the high end, quad-core tablets at lowered price points for consumers, the world's first quad-core smartphones coming soon and Windows 8 devices later in the year, we remain confident that Tegra 3 will drive a new phase of growth for our mobile business. With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. For the fiscal year 2012, revenue was $4 billion, up 12.8% from the prior year. GAAP net interest -- net income grew 129.5%, resulting in earnings of $0.94 per diluted share, an increase of 118.6% over the prior fiscal year of $0.43. Non-GAAP net income grew 54.2%, resulting in earnings of $1.19 per diluted share, an increase of 46.9% over the prior fiscal year of $0.81. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $953.2 million, down 10.6% from the prior quarter. As Rob discussed, the hard disk drive shortage had more impact on our mainstream GPU segments than originally anticipated, and our Tegra 2 products declined more rapidly than expected. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.4%, 0.8% lower than the prior quarter and our original expectations due to an additional charge in the quarter to settle a patent dispute with Rambus. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excluded this charge, was 52.5%, consistent with the record gross margins we achieved in Q3. These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $116 million for the quarter or $0.19 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income worth $158.1 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 3.6% quarter on quarter, due to the impact of the disk drive shortage on our mainstream GPU desktop and notebook businesses. Our professional business was down 3.6% from the record level achieved in the third quarter. Our Consumer business was down 42.5% sequentially. As mentioned previously, this primarily related to the sharp decline in our Tegra 2 products ahead of the ramp of Tegra 3, as well as the seasonal decline in our game console revenues. For GAAP, our outlook for the first quarter is as follows: Revenue at $900 million to $930 million; gross margin of 49.2%, plus or minus 1%; OpEx at $383 million; and a tax at approximately 20%. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our gap outlook: gross margin of 49.5%, plus or minus 1%; and OpEx at $340 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $52 million to $56 million, and capital expenditures in the range of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be 622.5 million. As for the FY '13 outlook, our view of the market has changed and the outlook we gave in Q3 should no longer be relied upon. We are updating our FY '13 outlook as follows: we expect the overall PC market to experience continued headwind from the disk drive shortage. We expect our GPU business to gain share. Our Professional Solutions Business is expected to have another record year. Maximus enables us to sell more than 1 GPU on to a workstation, and new supercomputer centers around the world are anticipating the shipment of Kepler. Tegra this year was $360 million, and we expect it to grow at least 50%. We expect gross margins to exit FY '13 at around 52%. We expect our OpEx investments in FY '13 to be approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for non-GAAP.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney.\nJoAnne Feeney - Longbow Research LLC: I just wish you could give us a little bit more clarity on the outlook, in particular which segments do you see driving the reduction quarter-over-quarter? And why are you expecting the decline in the gross margin? Is it purely volume or is it mix or some of both?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The top line decline for Q1 is expected to be due to the hard disk drive shortage continuing, as well as a shortage of 28-nanometer wafers. We're ramping our Kepler generation very hard, and we could use more wafers. The gross margin decline is contributed almost entirely to the yields of 28-nanometer being lower than expected. And that is, I guess, unsurprising at this point. And because we have -- we use wafer-based pricing now, when the yield is lower, our cost is higher. And so we've transitioned to a wafer-based pricing for some time. And our expectation, of course, is that the yields will improve as they have in the previous generation nodes, and as the yields improve, our output would increase and our costs will decline. And that's why we expect to exit the year at 52% or about.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: With regard to the Tegra business, and you gave some outlook for fiscal '13 in general, could you give us some indication as to how that looks as you go through the year? When do the Tegra 3 wins come up? And then perhaps talk about the impact of Windows on ARM and you talked about that having some potential impact later this year. If you could expand on that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're expecting to -- Tegra 3 -- as you know, Tegra 3 tablets are starting to ramp in the marketplace. But this quarter, we are expecting to announce and ship Tegra 3-based superphones. And they -- rumors of them are starting to -- and excitement about it is starting to leak, but at Mobile World Congress is when we expect to announce these devices. And we expect to announce and ship them this quarter. And so we're expecting Q1 to be a sharp uptick in Tegra sales and shipments. Our expectation is Windows 8 is later in the year. And Microsoft has given their estimates about Windows 8, and our expectation is that there will be meaningful contributions from Windows 8 later in the year, starting probably in Q3.\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: All right. And just as a follow-up, with respect to kind of what you're seeing in the PC market and specifically, the impact of hard drives, maybe give a little more color that. Obviously, we've heard from some of your competitors on that and it sounded like that the hard drive availability is getting somewhat better depending on who you talk to. How do you see that playing out kind of over the next 2 quarters or so as it impacts your business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, almost everybody has guided down. I think PC-centric semiconductor companies have guided down on average, I think about 8% Q1. And so I think everybody is expecting hard drive headwind to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2. As far as what we see, Q4 started out with less shortage than we -- than people have predicted, and the reason for that was because there was a lot of channel inventory and people consumed the channel inventories. The channel inventory dried up. Prices of disk drives in the channels started to spike. And, as you know, channel business is a large part of the discrete GPU business. And China is particularly a large region for us, where a large amount of the PCs are built in channel, and they are built -- what we call DIY. And so design it yourself or build it yourself or design it for you. And so you spec the parts and you go to on IT mall and they build a PC right there for you. And so in those part of the regions where -- in countries, regions and countries where people build PCs like that, the spot price of disk drives have increased quite a bit. And so our sense is that that's going to continue through Q1 and potentially through Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.\nVijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering on the F'13 guide, what is your guide for Tegra? And also, I mean, look at Tegra 3, what is the ASP -- what are the ballpark ASPs for Tegra 3 versus Tegra 2?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're -- we did about $360 million this year in Tegra 2 sales. We're expecting at least 50% growth year-over-year. The vast majority of that will be based on Tegra 3. ASPs of Tegra 3 is higher than Tegra 2, and our expectation is that it would stay that way through the year.\nVijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Got it. And on the gross margin line, I think you guys mentioned 49% year, 49.5% year exiting at 52%. Where do you see the margin improvement coming? When do you see it coming?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our margin drag is almost nearly entirely related to 28-nanometer. And so the margin improvement will come entirely from 28-nanometer. And TSMC is doing fabulously with 28, and this year, with 28 relative to 40, it's surely a huge improvement. But during transition years, because we have so much of our business tied to the leading edge nodes and because when we transition GPUs, we transition so much of it at once. And this year -- particularly unique this year is that the number of notebook design wins that we have and the number of 28-nanometer GPU design wins that we have is, at OEMs, is much, much higher than our previous generation. And so all of the transition of 28 is going to be very fast. And so we're just going to have to continue to work with TSMC and get the yields of 28-nanometer up as fast as possible. And we surely expect that by the end of the year, we're going to be in a pretty good place. We're in a pretty decent place now, but we just need to get the yields up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Maybe along the lines of the 28-nanometer yield. Have you got categorized what the problem is and is there a fix in place? And also, I just -- if you got all the product you needed, do you know what kind of gross margins would have come in?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There's no particular problem. This is the first major quarter of 28-nanometer shipments. There have been some shipments. There've been some shipments in previous quarters but very, very small. And so for TSMC, this is probably the first large quarter of shipments, and we're going to continue to improve yields from here. So there's nothing particularly wrong. This is just early in the learning cycle of a new node. And so we'll improve it with every single outs [ph]. And also this isn't a problem that we can solve. Everybody's using the same 28-nanometer. And so this affects all of us, anybody who uses 28-nanometer. So I think with everybody ramping production, there's going to be a lot more learning cycles both from us and from other people. But TMSC is in a good place now and we just have to keep improving it.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And just as follow-up. Over on the professional services group, can you say what the trend towards mobile workstations is and how does that affect your revenues for 2013?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The Professional Solutions group has -- includes notebook workstations. And so whether it's HP workstations or mobile workstations or Dell mobile workstations or Fujitsu mobile workstations, Lenovo mobile workstations, Quadro is a standard in all of those workstations. So we're delighted when people go mobile because oftentimes they have a mobile workstation as well as a desktop workstation. And so this is a good trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.\nCraig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: There were a couple of mentions of notebook share gain. Can you give us a better understanding of how broadly those might exist across different OEMs? And when would we expect to see those more, mid-year or more towards the holiday selling season?\nJen-Hsun Huang: In the Ivy Bridge generation, also lined up with the 28-nanometer GPU generation, and this is really toe-to-toe competition between the best GPUs in the marketplace. And our Kepler generation, which we hope to tell you more about soon, won design wins at virtually every single PC OEM in the world. And so this is probably the best GPU we've ever built, and the performance and power efficiency is surely the best that we've ever created. And as a result, our notebook penetration -- our notebook design win this year is expected to be very, very high.\nCraig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And so you're saying that we should expect to see those right away as Ivy Bridge comes out. As a follow-up, on the mobile side of the business, with Tegra, you've mentioned a 50% growth for this year. How would the notebook side -- or the smartphone, superphone side of that business compare to the tablet side of the business? Are they both growing about equally or one significantly more than the other?\nJen-Hsun Huang: My guess is that this -- and of course, this is just an estimate and just a guess at this at this point, but my guess is that we'll ship more in phones this year as we did last year in terms of units. And in terms of ASPs, it'll probably be close.\nCraig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly from me, and this one might be more for Karen. When the target model was initially established, I think the gross margin was 52%. It looks like it will -- from the guidance that's been provided on where we start the year, it's going to come in, I think, closer to 50.5%. So what's changed since September? I doubt there's been much of a change in terms of the plan for 28-nanometer, but is it just volume? Or what's the delta as we look where the gross margin target was and where it is now?\nKaren Burns: It's yield. It's yields on 28-nanometer that have come in worse than we originally anticipated.\nCraig A. Ellis - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And the yield improvement, do you think that is kind of steady through the year, or is that back-end loaded more in the back half of the fiscal year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It will be stemmed through the year. And this -- yield improvement is a function of the number of cycles of learning. And now the cycles of learnings as we -- as we've ramped up at TSMC, the cycle of the learning has really gone up. And so my expectation is that the yield improvement will steadily improve through the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nBrian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This is Brian Peterson stepping in for Hans. I just wanted to follow-up on this 28-nanometer issue. Just to be clear, this is specific to 28-nanometers for GPUs for NVIDIA? Or is this across the industry for TSMC?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think this is -- I guess, the rest of the industry will have to speak for themselves. Well, my guess is that this is across the industry. This 28-nanometer is still early and it's maturing. There aren't that many 28-nanometer products in the marketplace as of now, and the number of cycles of learning is not very significant and the amount of volume is surely not very significant. At this point, we've -- we're ramping very hard all of our 28-nanometer products. And the yield is much better than 40-nanometer when it first came up, but it's not as good as we had expected in our previous projections. And so we're going to have to work hard with TSMC and support them and encourage them and wish them well and to get the 28-nanometer yield up as fast as possible.\nBrian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And just a follow-up. You indicated that you expected tax rates to remain stable going forward. How do they trend in the January quarter?\nKaren Burns: We gave that guidance at 20% for Q1, if that's what you're asking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Research: This is Deepon for Shawn. I had a question about pricing going into this quarter and then maybe into the next if you tie with desktops, notebook GPU in particular.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Pricing is expected to be stable and healthy this year. The amount of 28-nanometer capacity in the world is not enough. And so I think we're expecting 28-nanometer to be constrained through the entire year. New generations of smartphones, new generations of GPUs are going to drive the demand for 28-nanometer capacity -- or drive the demand for 28-nanometer devices. And so I think you're going to find that this year is going to continue to be tight. We could use more 28-nanometer wafers, and TSMC's management team is working very hard on [indiscernible] us with our demand and they're driving cycle times hard and trying to improve yield. And so all of that is going to improve throughout the year and very steadily throughout the year. And if previous generations have been an indication, TSMC will improve their performance incredibly fast.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Research: And also, if you talk about channel inventories going into this quarter. Do you think this a lot of buildup maybe at the low end because of the HD [ph] issue and maybe about channel inventory in Tegra as well?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Channel inventory is actually okay, and there's no -- the channel is being very cautious in loading up, as you can imagine. And whether it's because of currency volatility in Europe or because of shortage of disk drives, nobody in the channel is being too heroic with respect to loading up inventory. So I think you're going to find that channel inventory is relatively lean across the board. And on the high ends, extremely short.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: With respect to the attach rates. I think you talked about that being driven lower by the hard drive shortages, so the upward price in hard drives being compensated by finding bill [ph] materials share someplace else. Can you talk about, as the hard drive shortage mitigates and those prices come back down, whether you expect the attach rate to go back up?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the attach rate of GPUs is driven not by anything but consumer demand. And I think that there are fewer PCs sold in Q4 than there was -- that we -- that the industry had expected. The attach rate of those PCs that were sold were stable and relatively consistent with our model. And so your premise is -- it's -- I don't think it's correct. And attach rates seems to be stable. The number of PCs sold has reduced. Some people think it's cannibalization from smartphone and tablets and other devices, but disk drive has surely played a role in that as well. And so when the disk drive supply resumes, my sense is that consumers' demand will return to what they were and GPU attach will remain stable.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understand. And then as a follow-up. In terms of the OpEx, I think the $1.56 billion you guided to for the year implies a little bit of an uptick as we move throughout the year. Can you talk about where the incremental spending is being allocated towards?\nKaren Burns: Just one clarification. That's on a GAAP basis, the $1.56 billion. It's $1.4 billion on a non-GAAP.\nJen-Hsun Huang: It's unchanged from our previous guidance. And what we've told you guys before, the increase in investment relative to last year on an absolute basis has to do with the fact that we're investing a lot more in mobile devices. This last year was a big year for us. It was a big year because GPUs grew quite significantly despite the shortage of disk drives and softness in the market towards the end of the year. But it was a particularly big year for us because this was the first year that we really engaged the mobile market and our mobile position really became established. At this time this last year, no one thought that we would really be as successful in the mobile market as we ended up being. And so I think that today, we have now 3 generations of Android operating systems and devices behind us. We have tens and tens of smartphones and tens of tablets. We have engagements with nearly every single Tier 1 OEM in the world on the mobile side, as well as on the computing side. And so I think that this was a pretty big year from that perspective. And because of that traction and because of that -- the success we've seen, we think it's really -- it makes sense for us to double down on mobile computing and go after it in a big way. And so we're going to have a lot more products this year than last, and you're going to see that we're going to have tablet devices, as well as tablet processors, as well as integrated processors with modems. And so this is an aggressive investment surely but it's a very big, big market opportunity, as you know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering within the 50% growth you're expecting for Tegra, are you factoring in contribution from Windows 8, or -- and if so, how big a contribution might that be?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are expecting at least 50% growth, and we are expecting Windows 8 contribution but not nearly the vast majority of it.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: And then I was wondering, if you're going to be seeing Tegra 3 ramping in your July quarter, is the early ramp going to be enough to, perhaps, help the gross margin line given that it's not going to be, if I'm understanding correctly, on the 28-nanometer node?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are going to be ramping Tegra 3 -- we're ramping Tegra 3 now. And so this quarter, Tegra 3 will make a large contribution. We're expecting Tegra to be up quarter-to-quarter about 50% as well. And so Tegra 3 is ramping significantly even into the April quarter. And you're right that the gross margins for Tegra 3 is better than our 28-nanometer gross margins in the first quarter. And hopefully, 28-nanometer yields will improve and by second or third quarter time frame, it won't make any difference.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. And last one if I could on the GPU business, excluding the professionals set, you gave a mix of expecting a down PC market because of the hard disk drive constraints but market share gains. Any ballparking on the net of that? Do you expect on a revenue basis, the year to be down, flat, up? Can you say at this juncture?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our expectation is that on the net, our discrete GPU business will be up. And in Q3 time frame, we were expecting, using industry analyst models of PC industry growth of 4% to 5%. I think the -- our estimates now are much lower than that and so we assume something lower than that. And so we'll see how it turns out in the final analysis, but we're assuming relatively no growth in the overall PC market. But because we\u2019re gaining share, because of continue to grow our professionals business, our discrete GPU business year-over-year will grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics you see as you go in and compete for Tegra 3 wins? I mean, we're hearing about a lot of competition on pricing and a lot of a guerrilla tactics out there. Can you talk about what you're seeing?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We haven't met too many gorillas yet, but elephants maybe. Let's see, we compete primarily today with Qualcomm. And the reason for that is because -- there are 3 major opportunities in the smartphone marketplace this year that are really exciting. In the United States, of course, LTE is very important. Outside of United -- and they have a very -- they have the only real integrated solution today and, in fact, they have the only shipping solution today. And so they have a very good position on LTE in the United States. Outside of United States, where LTE adoption is much further behind, the next major upgrade is quad-core. Today's dual-core phones needs to be upgraded. And so the next major upgrade, the next major superphone, the next major big thing is quad-core. And so Tegra 3 is incredibly well positioned there. So outside the United States, in Europe particularly, in China, you're going to see quad-core Tegra 3 phones coming on throughout the year.  The third growth opportunity is the 999 or what some people call 1000RMB phone. And this is an affordable, very affordable smartphone with dual-core capability and the way that they describe it, the way the marketplace internalized it is it's a phone that has the capability of an iPhone 4 but is extremely affordable. That's a great opportunity for us because Tegra 2 is a fabulous dual core and with a 3G modem, you could achieve RMB 1,000 in China in the near future. And so that's a pretty exciting opportunity for us, and we're just about to enter into that market opportunity. And so those are kind of the market opportunities and the competitive dynamics. It's really primarily the 2 of us. I think the highest level -- the reason for that has to do with the fact that in order to be successful in the leading edge in the Tier 1 phones, you need to have a great application processor and a great application processor road map. You need to have a world-class software stack because the software part of these phones has become the most complicated part. And the third, going forward, is the ability to integrate a modem. And we were fortunate to have purchased Icera last year and our integrated road map is going to be pretty exciting.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Got you. That's helpful. So it sounds like your quad-core features are compelling enough that pricing is -- you're able to maintain kind of strict pricing with your customers.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, we're able to get fair pricing on our Tegra 3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, I wanted to address this competitive issue from a different angle, which is from the handset vendor side. So increasingly, Apple and Samsung are taking more share in the market versus say, HTC, Motorola and others. So even though Tegra 3 could be a great product, how are new ensuring that you're engaging with the right set of customers? And what real underlying drivers are going into this expectation of 50% growth for this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're expecting to grow at least 50% this year, and it comes from 3 different -- maybe 4 different sources, if I can break it down. One is Tegra 3 phones. One is Tegra 2 phones for the 1000RMB market, which is the fastest-growing segment in smartphones today. The third is Android tablets. And as you know, we finally were able to put together a tablet that is both exciting, as well -- tablet architecture that's both exciting with Tegra 3 and Ice Cream Sandwich, as well as affordable. We've been able to reach the $249 price level for retail. And the fourth is Windows 8 on ARM. And so these 4 growth drivers, frankly, this last year, what really -- the only thing that really worked super-well for us, in even on Tegra 2, was smartphones, and that contributed to $360 million in revenues. And so this year, we're expecting smartphones from Tegra 3, from Tegra 2, from Tegra 3 Ice Cream Sandwich tablets and as well as Tegra 3 Windows on ARM tablets. And so there's a lot more opportunities for us. But you're right that Samsung and Apple are very, very strong. And so our strategy is actually very simple. By teaming up with the best partners in the world, we would like to bring great technology to them and partner with them to build exquisite devices. And also to move faster. I mean, we, as an industry, have to move a lot faster in bringing competitive solutions to the marketplace more rapidly. And so by partnering with HTC -- and they are a fantastic company. I'm not suggesting we announce any products here, but surely, a partner like HTC would be fabulous for NVIDIA to partner with.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And if I could just perhaps push back on some of those drivers. So for instance, the 1000RMB market. There, we have seen integration with base land and connectivity being an attractive feature. So how do you address that? And then on Android tablets, you have some things are getting better but outside of the Kindle Fire, we have not seen sales pick up as much, or perhaps that's just my perception of the market. So if you could address those 2 issues also.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the 1000RMB market has a lot of segments underneath that. And at RMB 1,000, you really need to have a world-class phone. And right now there just isn't a very good solution for a world-class, high-performance dual-core processor with integrated 3G modem. And surely, there's RMB 500 phones and they have low-end integrated solutions with 3G. But nothing sufficiently good at the RMB 1,000 to be able to claim that it's as good as an iPhone 4 but at a much affordable price. And so that segment, where you need to have a world-class high-performance dual-core processor like Tegra 2 and a great software stack, along with 3G modems are, as you know, quite affordable and quite abundant and they've been around for many years. Integrating those together on a bill [ph] material is not too difficult. And so that's one.  With respect to the tablets, Amazon Fire is a really interesting product and it's great e-reader. But our belief is that there's a marketplace for tablets that are much more general-purpose. I think the ASUS Transformer Prime is a first example of a tablet that can really demonstrate differentiation, and people love it, and it's, frankly, my favorite computer now and it's a lot of other people's favorite computers. It is a tablet sometimes, it's a full Notebook PC sometimes and the performance is really terrific. And so I think Ice Cream Sandwich addressed a lot of the challenges that the tablet industry had, Android had last year with fragmentation. But now with Ice Cream Sandwich, your phone is Ice Cream Sandwich, your tablet is Ice Cream Sandwich, all the applications that come off at the marketplace can work on both. And so I think that unification, it is the only operating system that allows that today. And so that's -- that, I think, is a great advance for the tablet market. And then lastly, at $249, if we can bring a quad-core -- if we can bring Tegra 3 to $249, and for those people who have seen and touched it, that tablet's going -- it's going to sell like hot cakes, we believe. Because it's the right price point, it's completely general-purpose and it's state-of-the-art. So we have reasons to believe that this tablet market is far from over, and there's a lot of interesting opportunities and differentiation to be brought to this market yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two questions. The first one is maybe just some clarification from you, Jen-Hsun. I think I'm hearing that GPU demand is being impacted by a combination of lower PC demand from hard drive shortages, hard drive ASPs squeezing out GPUs for the bill of materials and then a shortage of capacity from 28-nanometer. Can you just give us a sense -- maybe rank those in terms of what's most impactful to sales and diverse lease [ph]?\nJen-Hsun Huang: 28-nanometer shortage. I could use more 28-nanometer wafers today.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So that's the most impactful?\nJen-Hsun Huang: My estimate for the year for top line and gross margins would be 28-nanometer. That's where all of our new GPUs are going.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Well, I'm asking just specifically for first quarter, for the April quarter, though, where you think the impact is greater. From that shortage, from ASPs and hard drives or from shortages of PCs because of hard drives?\nJen-Hsun Huang: About the same. I mean, it's -- I haven't thought of it that way but it's about the same. But from a gross margin perspective, obviously, much more from 28-nanometer. Those are problems that are going to get solved for the whole industry. I think as the industry -- as TSMC ramps more and more 28-nanometers, their capacity would increase and their yields would increase and their cycle times will reduce. And this is a world-class company. And Morris and the management team are all over it, and they're doing everything in their power, and if history is any indication and it tends to be, they're going to work their way into a fabulous node here any time. And so we have just started ramping in the last several months. And so the Q1 is kind of a bit of a transition quarter for us. But I'm very confident that we'll work through the 28-nanometer yield issues.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And as a follow up, I hear you when you say at least 50% growth in Tegra. But your guidance there is nonetheless substantially lower than what your original guidance was. Can you just kind of walk through the delta here? Is it that you're pushing forward your expectation? Or do you think there's some lost business that you simply can't gain back?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There is one major delta. I'm glad you asked. There's one major delta from last - from our previous guidance. About, I would say, a couple of quarters ago, I would have thought that on balance, that Samsung was one of our largest customers as they were last year. But looking forward, my sense is on balance, Samsung will use their own application processors. They'll dabble outside probably and they'll use outside application processors like ours whenever their own can't serve their needs. But on balance, they're going to try to use their own. And so that's the big delta that I've taken off of my guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, so with the hard drive impacting GPU shipments now, what do you think revenues would be in the first quarter if there were no shortages? And do you expect that to come back as good news and met pent-up demand later this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Gosh, we just didn't really do that analysis. But if you think along the lines of where we currently guided versus a typical Q1 -- and some of that, we call it -- we're $100 million-plus short and call some of that -- some of that resulted from 28-nanometer yield and shortage, and some of that resulting from disk drives shortage. And call it half-and-half. So if you were just to take a swag at it, about $50 million.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you update us on the CFO search? And can you also update us on Icera? You talked about it briefly with the roadmap. When might we expect an integrated product and also, do you expect to ship base bands in the phones in calendar '12?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. We are doing a CFO search. We have many interesting candidates. I haven't decided on one yet and the reason for that is because I think Karen and the financial team are doing a fabulous job and I have a very -- it allows me to be very choosy and to set a very, very high bar. And so if you do know of someone, ask them to call me, but we have a lot of very interesting candidates. Icera. Icera is going to prove to be one of the smartest and one of the best acquisitions in our history. We are -- we will have shipping modems this year for sure. And hopefully sooner than later. And then our plan is to integrate our application processor, which, as you know, is already one of best in the world, and the Icera modem into an integrated product for the mainstream LTE market. And so we're doing that as quickly as can. And that's one of the reasons why we're investing heavily in OpEx is so that we could build this class of products for a much larger marketplace and a much larger market opportunity for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Sorry if I missed it, but did you actually provide a revised annual guidance in terms of the number, in actual number range?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We did provide new guidance. We did not give you a specific number. And the reason for that is because it ultimately depends on your estimates of the PC market and the disk drive -- how long the disk drive shortages is going to the last. We're not better predictors at that than other analysts, and we've taken it to a more conservative range ourselves. But if you applied that, your estimates of that, to some of the comments that Karen made earlier, you can come up with some estimates. Okay? Thank you.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I guess, last question, real quick. In terms of the percentage of your GPU portfolio that's on kind of 28-nanometer, any guesstimation there? And then kind of what are the projections to go -- going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It depends on the capacity that gets freed up. We would like to put as much of it as possible to 28-nanometer. But if we don't have enough capacity as we currently do not have, we would keep some of our GPUs in 40-nanometer. So it just depends on capacity.\nOperator: Your next question, your final question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.\nSimran Brar: This is Simran Brar calling in for Raj Seth. I have a couple of quick ones. Firstly, given that your Tegra business has some scale now, how are you thinking about margins in that business going forward? And secondly, what are the key growth opportunities for your professional services -- workstation business in 2012? And is 10% to 15% sort of still the right range to think about annual growth for that business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, Simran. Let's see. The first question with respect to Tegra. We expect our gross margins to be in the range of the corporate average. And our estimates are that it would be around that area, plus or minus, okay? Nothing dramatically different. Second is growth opportunities for PSG. In the area of workstations, we introduced a concept called Maximus -- not a concept, a platform technology called Maximus. And it allows for the workstation to not only visualize but it also allows it to compute. So you could do simultaneous simulation of fluid dynamics while seeing the fluid flow over a structure like a car or motorcycle or whatever in real time. And so Maximus has been received fantastically, and our hope is that more and more workstations will have not just 1 GPU inside for visualization but 2 GPUs, 1 for visualization and 1 for simulation. Next year -- this year is also the year of Kepler. It's been 2.5 years since firming and supercomputers and supercomputing centers around the world are waiting anxiously for Kepler to launch so that they can upgrade their supercomputers. So that's a growth opportunity for us. In the area of high performance computing as well, we're hoping that the work that we've done to make Tesla much easier to program for -- it's called OpenACC. It's a technique called directives, making it super easy for software programmers to take advantage of GPU computing and we've worked with industry on that. It's an open standard. So we're excited about the developments of that. The response has been fabulous. And hopefully that making GPUs easier to program will also increase its adoption. And so those are some of the growth initiatives that we have going in. And our expectation is that Quadro and Tesla in combination would PSG, will deliver a record year again this year.\nRob Csongor: Okay. Thank you, Simran. I think we're out of time for today. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking to you next time about our Q1 results.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference.

Desktop consumer graphics revenue rose beyond usual seasonal increases, due to strong global demand from PC gamers, driven by highly anticipated blockbuster PC games just starting to hit the shelves. Electronic Arts Battlefield 3, which launched on October 25, sold 5 million units in the first week, amid critical acclaim in the press, particularly for the highly advanced PC version. The latest installment of the highly successful Call of Duty franchise from Activision, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, launched on November 8. Electronic Arts says pre-orders for Star Wars: The Old Republic, a PC-only online game scheduled for release on December 20, are the highest they have ever seen. We believe this surge of PC gaming demand will drive increased demand for NVIDIA's GeForce products despite the soft consumer PC market. We expect a multiyear PC gaming cycle, as the PC becomes increasingly more powerful than 5 to 6-year-old gaming consoles. We also kicked off the next generation of 3D gaming with the NVIDIA 3D Vision 2 glasses, with LightBoost technology. The new glasses deliver a superior gaming experience, while NVIDIA's patented LightBoost technology delivers twice the brightness of our last generation solution.  While sellout attach rates remain stable, NVIDIA discrete graphics notebook revenues were lower in Q3, reflecting a market share drop of 4%. We believe this is due primarily to some Intel loss of shares in CPUs and our absence from Apple notebooks in this design cycle. With the tax rate stable, we believe we are well-positioned with design wins in both Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge notebooks to regain market share in upcoming quarters.  Sandy Bridge continues to drive growth for our discrete GPU business. According to the latest data from both Mercury Research and John Peddie Research, average discrete GPU attach rates remained constant overall at 36%, while integrated CPU continues to erode integrated graphics chipset market share. According to Mercury data, average discrete GPU attach rates have now remained flat, within a 2% variation quarter-to-quarter for the last 8 quarters. According to recent press reviews from Forbes to Hardware Canucks, discrete GPUs remain the PC market's first choice for a PC upgrade, while integrated CPU graphics continue to lag far behind the performance of discrete GPUs for the demanding gamer and enthusiast markets. While Sandy Bridge graphics are far below the minimum requirements for today's modern games and application, the combination of a Sandy Bridge CPU, with a GeForce discrete GPU, continues to deliver the best price performance solution for today's PCs. Our professional GPU had a record revenue quarter on strong professional graphics market demand and continued adoption of the Fermi generation Quadros. During the quarter, we also announced that Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which operates the world's premiere open science computing facilities for the U.S. Department of Energy, will deploy a revolutionary new supercomputer, Titan, based on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. Its 18,000 Tesla GPUs will deliver roughly 85% of the peak compute performance of Titan. With the potential to deliver over 20 petaflops of key performance, Titan, a Cray XK6 supercomputer, would be more than 2x faster and 3x more energy-efficient than today's fastest supercomputer, Japan's K computer. Our consumer products business, which includes Tegra processors, delivered solid growth in the quarter. NVIDIA and its partners added 3 more Tegra-based superphones to the 8 already available, the LG Optimus EX, LG Optimus Q2, and Motorola ELECTRIFY. We also added 13 new tablets for a total of 23 currently available, including the ASUS Slider, Sony Tablet S, Sony Tablet P, Toshiba Tribe 7-Inch, the Acer ICONIA A100, Sharp Galapagos eReader, Dell Streak 10, Lenovo ThinkPads, and Samsung's Galaxy Tab 8.9. We are pleased to see exciting new Tegra 2 devices ramped into production. And we are particularly excited to have introduced 2 days ago, the Tegra 3 processor, and the first Tegra 3 tablet, the groundbreaking ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Prime. It will be on shelves in the U.S. within a few weeks, in time for the holiday season. Tegra 3 ushers in the next generation of mobile smartphones and tablets. It is the world's first quad core mobile processor, delivering PC-like performance to mobile devices, while enabling ultralow power consumption. The Tegra 3 processor provides up to 3x the graphics performance of Tegra 2, and up to 61% lower power consumption. This translates into an industry-leading 12 hours of battery life for HD video playback. The Tegra 3 processor implements a new patent pending technology known as Variable Symmetric Multiprocessing, or VSMP. VSMP includes a fifth CPU companion specifically designed for work requiring little power. The four main cores are designed for work requiring high performance and generally consume less power than dual core processors. With Tegra 3, we begin the next phase of growth for our mobile business. While we are adding more tablet customers with Tegra 3, we are particularly excited to have more and higher volume smartphone design wins with Tegra 3 than we did at Tegra 2's production launch. We are pleased to officially be in production with Tegra 3, a fundamental growth driver for our mobile business next year. With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.07 billion, up 4.9% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5% was a record for the fifth consecutive quarter. Gross margin exceeded our expectations for the quarter, primarily as a result of strong demand and the high-end segments of our desktop GPU products and record sales in our Quadro professional graphics products. Non-GAAP OpEx was $317.6 million, slightly below our estimate. Combined, these results generated a non-GAAP net income of $217 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, up 12.1% over the prior quarter. Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was up 1% compared with the prior quarter. Desktop GPU revenue was up strongly by 23% in the quarter. This gain was despite a $47.3 million decline in our chipset revenue, as we end-of-life these products and exit the chipset business. Notebook GPU revenue decreased as compared with the prior quarter for the reasons Rob has mentioned. Our professional business had record revenue in the third quarter, up 9.5%, at $230.3 million. This was largely driven by our record sales in our Quadro professional graphics products. Our Consumer business was up 14% over the prior quarter, primarily through growth in Tegra sales, together with seasonal strength in game console revenue.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were at $2.75 billion, up 11%, or $273.9 million sequentially. Cash flow from operating activities was $244.4 million. Both accounts receivables and inventories were down at the end of the quarter, with DSO improving by 6 days, down to 32 days, and DSI by 10 days, down to 57. Our strong balance sheet position at the end of the quarter reflects the overall strength in our businesses, strong demand and shipment linearity, strong collections and management of inventory.  Our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows. Closing on a strong third quarter, we expect revenue to be relatively flat, plus or minus 2%. We expect gross margins to be flat to up 0.5 percentage points from our record levels achieved in Q3 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For operating expenses, we expect GAAP to be approximately $372 million and non-GAAP at approximately $330 million. The increase is primarily related to planned hiring in our strategic investment areas, as well as engineering costs related to new products as we bring them into production. We expect the tax rate to be between 14% and 16% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, excluding any discrete tax events that may occur during the quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Looking forward, could you give any color about your main segments as to any area that's going to be better or worse than the flat plus or minus guidance you provided overall?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. We're expecting GeForce desktop to be up, and we're expecting that to be up nicely, driven by the hit games that Rob talked about. This is likely a multiyear cycle of growth for PC gaming. This happens every major game console cycle towards the second half of its product life, because PC technology advances on a regular basis instead of once every 7 to 10 years. And so you could imagine how PC technology is dramatically better than a game console today, and you're starting to see that now with a new generation of games that are coming out, such as Battlefield 3. We're expecting Notebook to be flat to slightly down. We're expecting Quadro to be up. We already had a record quarter this quarter. Quadro is benefiting from the Fermi adoption. It's also benefiting from the fact that China and India and the other developing countries are increasingly moving to a design economy rather than just a manufacturing or a second sourcing economy. And so when China and India, particularly, move to design economies, the single most important tool of modern design is a workstation. And our market share in workstations is very good. So we're going to benefit from that for quite some time. Tesla is expected to be flat, and mobile is expected to be flat. And we'll see how the devices that have gone into production this quarter do in the marketplace. I think we had something along the lines of about 17, or 16, or 17 new devices that went into production, many new tablets, as Rob mentioned, and new phones.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And then a combined question. Channel inventory, and then what's your view on any impact included or otherwise in your guidance on the Thailand floods?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Channel inventory is in good shape. In fact, for most of our high-end products, the ones that PC gamers buy are particularly low at the moment. And so it reflects the demand that we're seeing. With respect to Thailand, the projection that we gave reflects how we view the marketplace as of now. If you look at the dynamics of the shortage, for some of our markets, it's really a nonfactor, for example, mobile, obviously, because we don't use hard disk drive in mobile, and you could argue that the money isn't spent in mobile is -- in PCs, could be spent in mobile. You could also see that in some of our other segments, where workstations, Tesla, and the high-end PCs, because the value in the margins are so good for our PC OEMs. In times of shortage, those particular platforms and segments are prioritized. And so there's puts and gets, and we'll see how it works out. But there's many favorable dynamics, as well as negative.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen And Company.\nRaj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, can you talk a minute about your long-term ambitions in the handset space, vis-a-vis, sort of market segments? You obviously comment at the high end of the market with Tegra. I'm curious as you look out sort of 18 months, maybe even a little bit more, how do you think about the other tiers, the mid-tier of the market, is that something we should expect in the target as you eventually start integrating Icera, and Tegra, and some of these things together?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our first entry into the market is where performance and visual experience is very important. And this is an area where we could add a lot of value. And so Tegra 2 came in to the segment that now people recognize to be quite an exciting segment, and we called it the super phone segment. The super phone segment is not insignificant. And as the segment -- as mobile devices become increasingly important to people's lives, and they recognize in the second and the third smartphone that they bought, that how wonderful they are, they tend to buy up. The characteristic is very consistent with that of people who buy cars, to people who buy PCs. That the first PC they buy, because they're not exactly sure how they would use it, they tend to buy in the mainstream segment. And over time, they buy a better and better one because realize how much their lives has been involved in it. We see the same thing in the superphones segment. And this is likely to be quite a good growth segment for us. We have more design wins in Tegra 3 today than we had at Tegra 2. We have more design wins, more devices, more OEMs. We didn't win them all. There are some that we lost. Motorola was one that I'm personally disappointed in not winning this cycle around. But the net, we have more designs and more OEMs going into next year. As a result related to the long-term plan, our goal is to continue to do a variety in the superphones segment, with amazing features for this segment. But in addition to that, with the Icera acquisition, we're now able to integrate the application processor and LT component into a single processor. This is a very large focus for a company at the moment. Part of our increase in OpEx is related to our efforts in this area. We think we can have a lot of value in bringing this capability into the mainstream segment. And hopefully, we'll be able to see the early examples of that towards the end of next year.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the prior question. I think we've seen Texas Instruments be quite aggressive in some of the lower end tablets and some of the lower end smartphones, I think you just alluded to that in your answer to the previous question. Can you talk about your plans for Tegra 2 versus Tegra 3? Do you intend to continue with Tegra 2 production at a lower price to kind of capture that low end of the market with Tegra 3 attacking in the high end? Or do you just continue to want to attack the superphone market with Tegra 3 only?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. There were a couple of tablets this year, if I look at overall the year, obviously, our tablet design wins are numerous and beyond count at the moment. There are many segments of the marketplace that we serve now, all the way from very high design content tablets in 10-inch to now increasingly many 7-inch tablets that are coming out to the marketplace. There were a couple of design wins that I wish we had this year that we didn't have. I already mentioned Motorola. We were surprised by the Amazon Fire. But frankly, we're not going to be surprised again. And so we're obviously very excited about Amazon and want to do our best to be a partner of theirs someday. And so I think those were the 2 main ones that I can really, really highlight. With respect to Tegra 2 versus Tegra 3, Tegra 2 will continue to ship into the marketplace. 3 new phones were introduced just this week -- or just this last quarter, and we're expecting to see those phones continue to ship. Tegra 3 is going to come into the marketplace in tablets ranging from 7-inch all the way to 10-inch. And the reason why Tegra 3 is such a both very high-performance as well as super affordable, it's because the battery life that was made possible by the technologies that are inside Tegra 3 that we talked about -- Rob talked about variable SMP as fifth core, which is essentially like an electric hybrid engine for Tegra 3. It consumes so little energy that the battery life could be much, much longer for Tegra 3 tablets. As a result, you could -- when battery life is long and the power is, and the processor is very energy-efficient, you can save enormous amount of cost around the system. There's a second great technology in the Tegra 3, it's called DIAdem, and it's the ability to per pixel, per frame, per scene to modulate the backlight so quickly that we over a long period of time, reduce the amount of backlight intensity and backlight energy by nearly half. We save as much power in the backlight without changing the visual fidelity at all to save, essentially, the entire power used by our chip. And so saving power, energy efficiency translates to reduced system bill of material. And as a result of the things, people are finding that they could take a Tegra 3 tablets both into very high segments because of its performance, as well as into very affordable devices, like 7-inch and such. And then, of course, Tegra 3 is going to revolutionize the smartphone market again by bringing quad core and a new level of capability this year. And it's going to be pretty exciting year for us on superphones.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, on the OpEx trajectory, you're guiding that up partly on the strategic new programs and partly, I assume, just on 28-nanometer new products and the sort of normal course of things on GPUs. Can you talk about how much is coming from each of those areas? And whether we should expect OpEx to continue to go up the similar rate in future quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The vast majority of the increase is coming from the very significant increase in design wins that we have in several areas. We have more notebook design wins for the Ivy Bridge cyle than we ever had in notebooks. And this is likely the most successful notebook cycle we've ever experienced. And so we've got a lot of engineers dedicated to getting those notebooks into production. The reason for our success, I believe, is because our Kepler generation of GPU was designed for intense energy efficiency. And with energy efficiency, we were able to translate that to simultaneously higher performance, as well as longer battery life. And so that's the first part. The second thing is we have more smartphones in design as a result of Tegra 3. We have more tablets in design as a result of Tegra 3. And on top of that, we have Windows 8 tablets and devices that we're building all over the world. And so those, all of those design wins translate to quite a bit of customer engineering, customer-facing engineering, to build these exquisite devices. And then there's a portion of it that is related to 28-nanometer tape out of new processors that will go into production shortly.\nOperator: And your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, I was wondering if you could just elaborate on why you think you lost Motorola? Was it a function of price or something else?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it's a couple of things, I think. Partly, you're going to have to ask Motorola. I think that, one, our rhythm is once every year. And Tegra 2 came into production a year ago, Tegra 3 is in production now. And for Motorola, they had their own internal rhythm and OMAP 4 was right in between Tegra 2 and Tegra 3. And they felt that OMAP 4 was a better processor than Tegra 2. Obviously, I feel different. And but Motorola made their choice. Second thing is, Tegra 3 is obviously more -- surely more value than OMAP 4 by a lot. At this point, I think it's very, very clear that OMAP -- or Tegra 3 is in a completely different class than OMAP 4. And so it was difficult for us to be price competitive relative to OMAP 4. And so I think that those 2 things play a role. We all have different perspectives on when new technology could be adopted in the marketplace. And we felt that last year was the year of the dual core processor. And dual core processors are dual core processors. It's been done. And now Tegra 3 is really bringing a new level of capability with variable S&P, 5 processors on a chip, as well as energy efficiency that's really never been seen before in the mobile world. And the combination of a much higher capability in performance, as well as much, much higher efficiency, and therefore battery life, we felt that we could bring a new capability to the mobile area. And so that was our perspective. And I think it's becoming increasingly clear that by the early part of next year, that superphones will have quad core. And I think we'll see how it plays out from here. But we'll work super hard to get back into Motorola. And obviously, very important partner, and they build amazing phones. And it would be a privilege and a pleasure to be part of them again.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: It's our understanding that TI's OMAP sells for about $12 to $14, where I believe NVIDIA said that Tegra ranges from $15 to $25, depending on the platform. So I guess, given OMAP's success on the ICS platform, would you expect any downward pressures to ASPs for mobile?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't know which Tegra is $15. But there are no -- if we're still talking about Tegra 3, there is no Tegra 3 that's $15. It's higher than that. And -- but Tegra 3 and OMAP 4 aren't targeting the same generation of devices and we're not targeting the same market. And so Tegra 3 is really designed for superphones. Tegra 3 is really designed for next-generation tablets. The thing that is -- so when you compare on a device per device level, processor to processor level, it's really hard to make that comparison. However, when you compare it at the system level, Tegra 3 is about cost equivalent. It's sometimes cost advantaged relative to last generation devices, including Tegra 2. And the reason for that is because Tegra 3 is so energy efficient, that it actually reduces your bomb cost, the system bomb cost, and by a fair amount. And so variable SMP and DIAdem, our image processing technology, makes it possible for us to reduce quite a -- some $10 worth of system reduction relative to last generation, and still be higher performance, and still be longer battery life. And so I think those things, when taken into consideration, is explaining why now that people understand what Tegra 3 can do and they realize it's really the right platform to invest in going forward. The advantage of investing in Tegra 3 now is even more important when you consider the processor we have beyond it, which is the integration of Tegra and an LTE modem. All of the software effort that is invested into Tegra 3 translates directly into the mainstream products and entry-level products towards the end of next year.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Lastly, could you give us an update on the CFO search?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're actively doing the CFO search. We're working on it very hard. However, because we have such a great team on board, and they're doing such a great job, it gives me the luxury of looking for someone who is very seasoned, who understands the technology industry and someone who -- somebody completely world-class, And so they advise me that luxury which very few companies have. But we have such a wonderful team in place that we can find the opportunity to go look for somebody really, really, truly great.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could give some color on the Tegra 3 superphone wins that you're expecting? It sounds like in Q1, we might start seeing these? And you mentioned a higher volume opportunity. I was wondering if you could give some color on that, and if that's inclusive of anticipating Windows 8 in 2012?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I understand your first question. I'm not sure I understand the second question. What is the higher volume opportunity?\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Well, where are you getting to your expectations for it to be higher volume than what you did in superphones with Tegra 2? And is that simply because you're including the Windows 8 opportunity in that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. We are working very, very hard right now on all of these devices, and I'll answer it backwards. The reason why we expect Tegra 3 to be more successful than Tegra 2 is, one, we have much, much more experience in building these mobile devices than we did before. And there's not a single mobile -- there's not a single cell phone company that I know who looks at us and say, do you know anything about building phones? Everybody is well past that. They think not only are we -- do we know how to build phones, we're fabulous at building phones with them. And so I think that the velocity of engagement is much greater than it used to be, both on our side, as well as on their side. We have more phones in development now than we did in Tegra 2. We have more tablets in development. And we have more OEMs than we had in Tegra 2. And then not to mention on top of that, Windows 8. But even in the absence of Windows 8, we have far more OEMs and devices in development today than we did with Tegra 2.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: And did I understand you correctly, you expect to see those phones emerging in Q1. And then also, with regard to your comments earlier around OMAP, how do you get the industry taking advantage of all quad cores, the quad core architecture, especially when the mainstream is going to be dual core? And I get the power savings, but beyond that application to really take advantage of those capabilities?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're working on these devices as hard as we can, but we're not the device makers. And so my expectation is that Q1 is an appropriate time for most of these -- for many of these devices to come to market. But we'll get there as quickly as we can. Quad core is already utilized by a lot of applications. And whether it's imaging applications, which, as you know, is a very large reason why you would like to have snappiness and processing capability on a mobile device, whether it's computational photography or augmented reality, or many of these type of new capabilities really need to have a lot more processing. The way that you load a website, it's multi-threaded. When you play a game, most of these games are ported from, most of these high-end games, are ported from engines that are developed already for game consoles and PCs, and both of those platforms are already heavily multi-threaded. I think there's 6 processors inside the Xbox, 6 threads. And I think inside the PlayStation 3, there's, well, geez, countless threads. I think something like 8 or 16 threads. And so 4 threads is very usable by many of these, that will be consumed by many of these applications.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to switch gears here for a quick sec. You did quite well last quarter in Quadro. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about that opportunity? I guess, in terms of the near-term, as well as where you're seeing growth in the emerging markets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, well, the emerging markets are just going into the design economy. When you think about China and India, I think that most people would say that these are economies that have been driven by outsourcing from the United States and also manufacturing revenues from opportunities from the West. But increasingly, as the economy develops and their local consumption increases, the local economy will move and will transition to design economies as well. And so whereas you need factories to outsource, and you need PCs to outsource our IT jobs in order to move into the design economy, whether it's Tata or just recently, one of the most ambitious digital projects in the history of India, Ra.One, was done with NVIDIA's technology. And as you know, Bollywood is many times larger than Hollywood in terms of the number of movies and the number of fans that support that industry. And that industry is moving completely to digital, as we have done here in the United States and in the West. Tata, the car company. In China, the focus of their economy has moved towards much more indigenous IP design and indigenous industrial design, and that requires workstations. Over time, I would expect that the size of the Quadro business will reflect the size of the economy. If China becomes as large as the United States in terms of the size of their economy, I would expect the Quadro opportunity in China would be as large as it is here in the United States. And the same goes for India.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I see, got it. That was helpful. And then I guess, I actually had 2 quick questions. One was on, I think Ivy Bridge, you said that you expect to have much higher share on Ivy Bridge. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about that? And then also, Project Denver, something that a lot of us are curious about, hoping you could give us a little update there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: This cycle, our market share on the Intel platform was north of 50% overall. But we recognize that -- and the reason for that success was a technology called Optimus that invisibly and automatically makes it so that GPU can be in high-performance state or in extremely low power state without intervention from the user, that it just figures it out by itself. And as a result, you have very high performance when you need it, and you have extremely long battery life when you need it. The thing that kept us from being even more successful is that our processor could've been more energy-efficient in itself. And so one of the things that we dedicated ourselves to do with Kepler was to focus an enormous amount of our energy on creating an architecture that was energy efficient. And the result is just really, really fabulous. And so our customers see that, they understand the benefit of it. And in combination, between Kepler and Optimus, we just have a great solution. And we just have a great, great, great solution. And this is probably as competitive as we've ever been in the Notebook segment. Project Denver, our focus there is to supplement, add to arms capabilities by extending the arms architecture to segments in a marketplace that they're not, themselves, focused on. And there are some segments in the marketplace where single-threaded performance is still very important and 64 bit is vital. And so we dedicated ourselves to create a new architecture that extends the ARM instruction set, which is inherently very energy-efficient already, and extend it to high-performance segments that we need for our company to grow our market. And we're busily working on Denver. It is on track. And our expectation is that we'll talk about it more, hopefully, towards the end of next year. And until then, until then I'm excited, as you are.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, a few days ago, a major touchscreen controller vendor indicated that it saw some excess channel inventory in Android tablets. I'm curious, what checks do you have in place to gauge sell-through in your tablet and smartphone products to make sure that product is not piling up in inventory somewhere?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess our channel checks are no more magical than others. I think the -- Tegra 2 is the only device, it's a sole source device in the devices that we're in. And so we have a relatively close relationship with our OEMs. And it really is not second source. I think that with respect to other components in the system, oftentimes, they're second sourced, and oftentimes, they're cost reduced in the middle of the cycle. And we put a lot of our energy working with our OEMs, improving the overall bill material cost of the system even throughout the entire product cycle. And so I can't really speak for what other people see. But so far, what we see is relatively normal.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And as a follow-up, can you give us a sense of what the unit or sales mix have been between smart phones and tablets this year? And what do you think it's sort of shaping up to be for next year? Because my sense is a lot of people are still somewhat skeptical about the android tablet opportunity, maybe even more so after the launch of Amazon Kindle Fire. So any sense of how much of your growth prospects depend more on tablets rather than smartphones, I think are a useful indication for us.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. I think the overall mix is higher units in phones, but about equal mix, relatively equal mix in terms of overall revenues. In terms of tablets, Android tablets, I think that the early response was premature. It is the case that there are many things that we could've done better. But it is also the case that the OEMs, ourselves, Google, really rolled up our sleeves and addressed many of the challenges that kept it from being more successful right out the gate. You see now that these tablets are much more affordable. They're available in multiple sizes, from 5-inch, to 7-inch, to 8-inch, to 9-inch, to 10-inch. Some of them are foldable. Some of them are transformable. And so there's all kinds of different types of manifestations and realizations of the Android tablet. My understanding is that the Android tablet has now grown from approximately 0% in the March timeframe to now about 1/3 of the overall tablet market. And we represent about 2/3 of that. And my sense is that, that's going to continue to grow. One of the things that I really love about Honeycomb 3.2 and then even more so with Ice Cream Sandwich, is that the applications that are -- that you have on your smartphone will work wonderfully on your tablet and vice versa. That the marketplace can now take advantage of the incredibly large install base of Android phones to support applications that would benefit the tablet. So I think that, that strategy is ingenious. And I think that the Android team has done a fabulous job implementing that strategy. So I think that starting with Honeycomb 3.2, and surely all these various form factors and price points and device sizes, and then also Ice Cream Sandwich, will surely accelerate that. So I have a lot of -- I'm very enthusiastic about the Android tablets. But having said that, the Android phone, the market is just enormous and growing quickly. It is, I think in the United States, it's already the highest market share. I think the last month or last quarter, it reached something like 64% market share, in United States. Pretty extraordinary growth. And in China, Android, or the base of Android, surely is growing very, very quickly as well. So I think that the smartphone market is going to continue to be very vibrant on Android. And that will only fuel, and that will only feed the Android tablet market, as well, over time. And I think we're seeing all of those dynamics now. So I'm much more enthusiastic about the tablet today than I was when it first launched. And I think the results would suggest that, that's right.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And just one last one, if I may. Over -- you have quite a bit of cash, almost 30% or more of your market gap, you're also generating good levels of cash. What will it take to start buying stock more actively at these levels?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It's something we consider all the time. We just don't have anything to report today.\nOperator: And your next question is from Uche Orji with UBS.\nUche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, let me just start by asking you to help me understand how the economics of Tegra 3 works? You talked about taking out $10 of bomb. But obviously, in a market where we're seen more and more low cost tablets being launched at ASP above $15. I just wanted to understand, what are you taking out when you're talking about $10 worth of bomb? I'm just trying to understand how with $15 ASP and above, Tegra 3 can be economical within the lower cost tablets market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, without being too specific, because I don't think it really matters, I think the key is that, all right, the higher your power, the more you have to spend electronically to support it. And the lower your power and the more energy-efficient you are, the more you could reduce some system costs, and/or use external devices that are much more affordable, but consumes a little bit more energy because the core processor, which is where most of the energy is consumed, is so efficient. And so when you're looking at a tablet and then you think about an application processor that's about $20, it doesn't represent a very large percentage of the overall cost actually. And so the application processor is often not the issue. The issue is everything else. And what we've done is we've taken a holistic system approach, and we thought about the energy consumed by the backlight. We thought about the energy consumed by the memory and the rest of the system. And we were able to dramatically reduce that through architecture, and that's implemented in Tegra 3. And so that's kind of the highest level on what we've done, and I think our customers are really, really excited by the system cost reduction we were able to bring them.\nUche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Just another question, please, to follow up from that. In terms of the handsets design wins you're getting, I mean, Tegra 2 started off with quite a few handsets and, obviously, the revenue kind of started out strong and flatlined for a while. As we look at the design wins for Tegra 3, I have 2 questions. One is, how much more confident are you that one of these design wins will suddenly translate to big revenue? Obviously, this is not something within your control. But I'm just trying to gauge your level of confidence. And then 2, with more design wins, do you have to spend more OpEx to support it? And if the revenue doesn't come through, is there any flexibility as to being able to make your model a little bit less saddled with higher fixed costs while the design wins are not necessarily shipping as aggressively? I don't know if you understand what I'm trying to say. But I'm just trying to understand that, if I look at the experience of Tegra 2 into Tegra 3, how shall I believe the revenue will come through?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I'm more confident in Tegra 3 at this point than I was in Tegra 2 at this point a year ago. We have more design wins. We're better at it. We surely are much, much better at it today than we were a year ago. We have a lot more engineers. We are engaging with a lot more customers, working on a lot more devices that will enter into the marketplace earlier than we entered into this year. By the time that we started shipping, it was really dribbles and drabs in April. And I think we're going to go into this coming year with a pretty good running start. And so if you're asking me about my confidence, I'm surely more confident now with a year of building mobile devices behind me and the level of expertise that we've been able to develop over the years. And I think the reputation of our company, the trust that our OEMs now have in us, and the leadership position we have with our processor, Tegra 3, is pretty unambiguous. And so I think I surely feel more confident today than I did on the Tegra 2 cycle. With respect to investment, we're investing in both our Notebook PC growth, we're investing in our PC growth, as well as our mobile devices growth. And we believe that we're addressing very large TAMs, and irrespective of whatever experience, albeit I'm more confident right now in your scenario, even if in that scenario that you hypothesized about, I'm fully committed to this marketplace. I believe that the future is visual. I believe that the future is mobile. And we're going to invest into it. We're looking at a $25 billion TAM in some 4, 5 years, and we're going to after it. And so I think that irrespective of any unexpected hiccup in the short term, we're going to stay determined and focused on building a great company.\nOperator: Your next question is from Glen Yeung with Citi.\nUnknown Analyst - : This is [indiscernible] with Glen Yeung. My question is [indiscernible] the conference back in September, you gave fiscal '13 guidance [indiscernible] that's going on in Europe and [indiscernible] impacting hard disk drives. Can you please discuss if there are any changes to your view, the guidance?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I have no change in my guidance, nor in my projection, nor do I believe the short-term information that we have necessarily warrants it. As we talked about earlier, it is really unfortunate what happened in Thailand. And in some areas it would affect our business, in some areas it would benefit our business, in some areas it would have no impact on our business. And a large -- a big part of our business, as you know, is in aftermarket, retail, purchase of graphics cards that people buy to enhance their PCs, so that they can play the latest is. It's a very large market because the game market is so large. And I don't think that, that will be affected by the situation in Thailand. I don't think our mobile industry, mobile business will be affected by it. If anything, it will be effected in a positive way. I think that our workstation business, which is very large, and drives a larger part of our profit dollars, will not be affected. And if anything, it will be affected in a positive way. And so I think that there are many areas where it's unaffected, some of them will be affected, and some of it is positively affected. And so I think at the moment, I won't change anything.\nOperator: And your next question is from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Can you just give us a brief update on Icera? When you might expect to get into a handset with that product? And also share with us your view of integrated architecture versus discrete architecture, and how Tegra fits into the future there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I'll work backwards. Number one, I don't believe that it makes sense to integrate for tablets. It doesn't make sense to integrate for clamshells. And mostly, it doesn't make sense for superphones. However, for the mainstream and entry-level smartphones, I think it makes a lot of sense to integrate. And our plan -- we're are actively working on an integrated product. We're actively working on many nonintegrated products as well, for all of the segments that I described. For the integrated product, I hope that we'll have something to sample next year. And then with respect to the first question, Icera phones, we have several Icera phones with Tegra processors actively in development and racing to market, as we speak. In the meantime, and I think going forward as well, for our standalone application processors, the Tegra processors, we're delighted to, and we continue to work with the standalone modem companies. Because there are many accounts and many customers where they have deep partnerships and a lot of experience with, and there are many where we have a lot of experience with. And I think that partnering with them is helpful to our combined partners and our combined customers. And the market is growing so rapidly that our collaboration is surely better.\nOperator: And you're final question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And Jen-Hsun, you're absolutely right. You should actually go see Ra.One, it's a great movie. I was surprised to see, your marketing guys did a great job with the product placement, it was right front and center. My question, a little bit longer-term. What does -- you talked about it a little bit, what does V8 give you? You talked about high-performance computing. Are you also hoping to take that into low-power servers? And then just around that, how did the dynamics change? Because there's a lot of ARM licensees, but you guys are the lead licensees for ARM V8?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. I guess -- let's see, where do I start? I think the Denver -- I wanted to make sure that I don't repeat myself. But the Denver architecture is intended to extend the ARM instruction set into segments where ARM is not naturally likely to go themselves. And it's designed to be -- to bring a new level of performance and efficiency to the ARM instruction set beyond where they currently are. And it's not because ARM is not able to design these things. It's because our market focus is perfectly aligned with ARM in some areas, like mobile, and tablets, and clamshells. But in some areas that are very important to us, they're rather non-markets for them today. And we, in partnering with them, could add value by bringing the ARM instruction set into segments of the marketplace that are very important to us. There are also segments in the marketplace, and you mentioned high-performance computing, there are segments in the marketplace that desperately would like to see an energy-efficient instruction set architecture, like massively parallel processing in supercomputing. Or in a very energy-efficient high throughput servers. And so these are opportunities that are very interesting to us as well. And as we get closer to the release of Denver, we'll reveal more and more of the strategies that are related to Denver. And I think you're going to be as blown away and as excited as I am.\nOperator: And at this time, do you have any closing remarks?\nRob Csongor: No. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to talking to you about our Q4 results, and we'll see you next time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Rose, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Now my pleasure to introduce the President and Chief Executive Officer of NVIDIA, Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang. Go ahead, sir.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition to Karen Burns, our Interim CFO, with me on the call today is our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Rob Csongor. Rob is a longtime veteran of NVIDIA and one of our original employees. He joined our company in 1995, and has since ran product marketing, launching our first product, NV1, was GM of our embedded business, and in 2003, I asked him to start our notebook GPU business. Our notebook GPU business is now approaching $1 billion a year and has just had a record quarter. Over the last 5 years, he was our VP of Corporate Marketing, responsible for many of the company's marketing initiatives. I'm very excited to welcome Rob to his new role, where he will bring his knowledge of NVIDIA and to serve the investor community and communicating the company's growth strategies. Please join me in welcoming Rob to his new job. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Rob to begin our summary of second quarter of fiscal 2012.\nRob Csongor: Thank you, Jen-Hsun. After our prepared marks, we'll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up question.  Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website, and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 18, 2011, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2012. The content of today's conference call is NVIDIA's property and cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.  During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our Form 10-K, for the fiscal period ended January 30, 2011, and the reports we may file from time to time on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our statements are made as of today, August 11, 2011. Based on information available to us as of today, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. With that, let's begin. Our GPU business was strong in Q2, driven by our record quarter for notebook products. Despite typical seasonal weakness in the PC market, we recorded record notebook GPU revenue, increasing our notebook GPU market share by 9% to 50.6% according to Mercury Research. We launched the GeForce GTX 560M into the heart of the notebook gaming markets, delivering DirectX 11, 1080p gaming, and Optimus technology to notebooks for the first time ever. Optimus Technology optimizes your notebook performance by intelligently delivering power when you need it and conserving it when you don't, completely automatically. In addition, we launched the world's fastest notebook GPU, the GeForce GTX 580M. The GeForce GTX 580M, along with NVIDIA and Optimus technology, delivers 5 hours of browsing battery life and 100 frames per second performance in Call of Duty: Black Ops. While our desktop GPU business decreased within typical seasonality, overall desktop GPU attach rate of consumer PCs remained strong at 55%. We added 2 new desktop products targeted at the sweet spot of the gamer market. First, the GeForce GTX 560 into the extremely popular $199 segment of the desktop gamer market. And secondly, launching new 3D Vision wired glasses, delivering the best 3D PC experience at a new affordable price of $99. The Sandy Bridge transition continues to drive growth for our discrete GPU business. According to Mercury Research, integrated CPU eroded integrated graphics chipset market share, while discrete GPU attach rates remained constant overall. GPU attach rates actually increased in notebook, from 33% to 36%. Notebook discrete GPU shipments were up 6.7%. Industry press is confirming what we had expected, that while Sandy Bridge graphics still won't come anywhere near the performance of a discrete GPU, according to Tom's Hardware, the combination of a Sandy Bridge CPU with NVIDIA discrete GPU, delivers the best price performance solution for the PC market. Our enterprise workstation GPU business grew 4%, as the adoption of the Fermi generation continues to ramp. During the quarter, we also launched an extremely important product into the compute market, the Tesla M 2090 GPU, the world's fastest parallel processor for high-performance computing. In the latest version of AMBER 11, one of the most widely used applications for stimulating behaviors of biomolecules, 4 Tesla M 2090 GPUs, coupled with 4 CPUs, delivered the fastest results ever reported, according to Ross Walker, Assistant Research Professor at the San Diego Computer Center, and principal contributor to the AMBER code. Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra processors and embedded products, increased 37% to $167.7 million, with much of the increase revenues coming from embedded products. We delivered another strong quarter for Tegra, with new Tegra 2 based android products hitting the market. Among them are the Motorola Photon 4G and DROID X2; the world's thinnest, lightest tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1; the Toshiba Tribe; Lenovo IdeaPad K1 and ThinkPad Dell Streak 10 Pro in China. In addition to new products, Tegra 2 continues to have legs, with new products launching into new regions and with new partners. Consumers can now buy Tegra super phones on all major carriers in the U.S., including T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. In addition, we announced with Alibaba and Tianyu, the first smartphone designed by a China OEM, and the first phone offered by Alibaba. In May, at Computex 2011 in Taipei, our Tegra 2 processor was selected from more than 400 products, and awarded the prestigious Computex Best Choice Award for smart handheld devices innovation from the Taipei Computer Association. Our next generation Kal-El processor had a very strong quarter of design wins, with new products launching in time for the holiday season. In addition, our acquisition of Icera lets us expand beyond the super phone and tablet segment, and address mainstream smartphones. With these moves, we believe we are well-positioned to continue our strong momentum with Tegra. With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. Revenue for the second quarter was $1.02 billion, up 5.7% sequentially. GAAP gross margin of 51.7% was a record for the fourth consecutive quarter. Gross margin exceeded our expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter, primarily as a result of a more favorable product mix and our GPU and TFB businesses. GAAP OpEx was $351.3 million, in line with our estimates, as it includes $17.3 million of costs related to Icera, including costs of its ongoing operations and those related to its acquisition. Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $151.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. The dilutive effect of the Icera acquisition, including its results of operations and all acquisition-related costs, was $0.02 per diluted share. Consequently, net of the Icera acquisition, we achieved the high end of our outlook range for the quarter. Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was relatively flat compared to the previous quarter, despite the continued quarter-over-quarter decline in our MCP revenue, as we end-of-life these products. Desktop was seasonally down, while notebook grew strongly, as we continued to gain share through the Sandy Bridge transition. We also benefited from the first full quarter of licensing revenue from Intel. Our professional business was up 4.2% from the prior quarter. Our Quadro professional graphics business increased sequentially, as we saw a pickup in enterprise IT spending, and as we continued our transition to Fermi generation products. Our Consumer business was up 36.8% over the prior quarter. Much of the increase was driven by game console royalties, which were seasonally up over the prior quarter, and customer refreshes and embedded entertainment products. Tegra revenue was steady, as the product ramps of our first quarter reached consumer. Icera's revenue contribution was not significant.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.47 billion, down $252 million over the prior quarter, due primarily to the purchase of Icera for approximately $352.2 million. This was partially offset by our cash flow from operations of $82 million.  Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter was $419.9 million, up $76.7 million sequentially. Although our DSO increased 5 days from 33 to 38, our demand was relatively linear for a fiscal second quarter, and remained under our corporate average. Our inventories at the end of the quarter were $361.9 million, down 5% from $381 million in the prior quarter, as we actively managed production builds throughout the quarter.  Our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows. We see strengths in our business coming into the third quarter, and expect revenue growth of 4% to 6%. This is despite the ongoing decline from our discontinued MCP business. We expect gross margin in the third quarter to stabilize at the record levels achieved in Q2, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Of course, we will work hard to continue to improve our gross margin. For operating expenses, we expect GAAP OpEx to be between $361 million and $366 million, with non-GAAP OpEx between $319 million and $321 million. The increase is primarily related to engineering costs for new product tape outs, verifications and qualification, and to account for a full quarter of Icera's ongoing cost from operations, as well as critical hires in key growth areas.  While we will continue to control expenses very tightly, we believe continued strategic investment in our business is critical to our company's future growth. In particular, within the mobile space, we will invest in supporting the next generation Windows on Tegra, ramping our baseband processor business and executing on design wins. We believe the tax rate will track near 16% for the rest of the year, resulting in an annual effective tax rate of about 15%. This outlook includes Icera.  That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: I was on the guidance for up 4% to 6%, I was wondering if you could add some color on what you're seeing in terms of order trends, where you're seeing strengths from a geographic perspective, and maybe by segment, which of the end markets do you expect to be the strongest and weakest for you going into Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, going to the first, the first part of the quarter looks pretty good. And bookings look strong. We don't see anything unusual across the world. And your question on segments, nothing unusual. I mean, frankly, nothing unusual.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: Well, as far as your outlook goes, do you expect, for example, your notebook or desktop GPU to be the strongest or Tesla workstation?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're expecting growth in enterprise. We're expecting growth, which is our Quadro and our Tesla business. We're expecting growth in our GeForce business. And we're expecting business to be steady as she goes on the Tegra business. We're ramping new tablets and new phones, introducing new tablets and new phones this coming quarter. In Q2, we introduced 6 new phones and 5 new tablets. Next quarter, we'll introduce more. And we're looking forward to those devices being successful as well.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie Research: And if I might, the last one. What did graphics chip pricing units do sequentially?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No significant change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann of Raymond James.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Jen Hsun, as you look at your roadmap with Kal-El and next year's new products and the introduction of a new Google Android operating system, what is the competitive environment look like? What are your customers saying? And how does that all play out based on what you think your position is, as we look into next year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are now, I think, the only processor to be in production. We're shipping devices in Froyo, Gingerbread, as well as Honeycomb. And we just recently introduced and went to production with Honeycomb 3.2. If you look at our position now relative to a year ago, at this time, we had no operating systems shipping at the time. And in this business, having a stable operating system and having a full software stack translates to velocity. And so we've made really, really large investments in the Google operating system, as you know. And we have a great working relationship with those guys. And so as soon as our next generation processor Kal-El is ready for production, we can run like the wind, like we do in the PC industry. Now that we have a full software stack ready to go.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And if I can, just a quick follow-up. 28 nanometer, how does that look relative to 40-nanometer? That was a tough industry transition. Can you give comment there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: 28, we are far, far better prepared for 28 than we were for 40. Because we took it so much more seriously. We were successful on so many different nodes for so long that we all collectively, as an industry, forgot how hard it is. And so one of the things that we did this time around was to set up an entire organization that is dedicated to advanced nodes. And we've had many, many tests chips run on 28-nanometer. We have working silicon and, momentarily, about to go to production with 28-nanometer. And it's looking really good, it's looking much, much better than our experience with 40-nanometer. It's just a comprehensive, across-the-board engagement between TSMC and ourselves, and making sure that we're ready for production ramp when the time comes. So I feel really good about 28.\nOperator: Next in queue is Raji Gill of Needham & Company.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company, LLC: A question on the Tegra part of the business. You said it held steady, but really didn't contribute to any of the sequential growth in the CPB business. Just wondering why that is, especially with all the new phones and tablets that have come out in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, why wouldn't you see NVIDIA figure jump in the second quarter? And also, how that relates to the, around the consumer side in October, should we see a seasonally down quarter on the Sony royalty business and will that be offset by Tegra and the CPB business in the October quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our phone business ramped up towards the second half of the Q2. And so these devices are just now going to production. The Photon 4G, of course, was just announced. And the reviews have been fabulous. And I'm delighted to see Motorola build such a great phone. The Samsung Galaxy R just went to production. And so those 2 phones are really wonderful phones and the Motorola phones in China just went to production. And so Q2 -- those devices didn't contribute very much to Q2's business. And now, as we look forward to Q3, all of these phones that are ramping up, we now have something like 53 SKUs around the world. And we cover some 16 of the world's top 20 carriers. And so these devices are now just going into production. And so we look forward to seeing how they do. And our results will reflect that. But I think that the indicator that probably makes the most sense for me to watch and for all of us to keep an eye on is just the number of phones that go to production each quarter and the number of countries and carriers that we increasingly expose ourselves to. And I think the numbers will follow.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company, LLC: And in the guidance, you say -- you talked about including Icera. Is that meaningful in terms of a revenue perspective?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Not very much yet. The Icera modem technology was just recently approved by a very large carrier for a product acceptance this year. And they were approved for LTE multimode. Some companies have LTE modems and some company have 3G modems. Very few companies have LTE 3G, 4G multimode modems. And they passed 100% of the LTE testing. And in fact, the Icera modem is used in a very large number of the 3GPP industry standards body's testing. And it is the reference by which many modems are tested. And so I think that business will surely be very important to us in the LTE segment. And then a little longer term, our intention is to integrate the modem into our Integra application processors so that we can address this segment that is very fast growing and also very large, the mainstream segment of the smartphone market.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company, LLC: And just last question on the, going back to the Sony royalty. Can you maybe just remind us where the seasonally strong quarters are? Is it the second quarter, as you mentioned? Does it trail off in the third quarter and then bounce back up again in the fourth quarter?\nKaren Burns: It will be sequentially up again quarter-over-quarter, Sony royalties, not by a lot. But typically, the ramp for the game consoles is a ramp that just grows to Q3 as you go into Christmas, back-to-school. But Q3 is one of the strongest quarters.\nOperator: You have a question from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Tesla adoption in high-performance computing and data centers, would this be tied at all -- is the adoption tied to world GDPs or if there's a slowing economy, do you customers get more hesitant or does it accelerate it?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, that's a good question. We're trying to figure it out ourselves, to be honest. Because it's still a relatively small business, as you know. It's on its way to be a couple of $100 million business. And more and more OEMs are adopting it and are bringing it to market. Just this last quarter, we introduced the M 2090 module that goes into data center configurations from HP and Dell. And so we're ramping that business up. But it's still very much, at the moment, an application-driven business. The more applications we have ported, the greater the opportunity we will see. And so I don't know that in the near term right now, that it's tied to GDP or anything like that. I just think it's just way too small of a business to be affected by the global economy. People who are early adopters have very severe computation needs, and those severe needs exist whether the economy is doing well or not. Probably, more than anything right now, the lumpiness of the business comes from, occasionally, very large deals because they go into large data centers. And those design wins and installations don't happen on a regular basis yet. And so every now and then you'll see some lumpiness. But this is a business that just still being developed.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. So it's more of a technical issue, you'd say, right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say right now, it's an application limited business. The more applications we have, the more applications we announce, the greater the market opportunity is, that's one. And then number 2, it's dependent on large data center design wins.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. If I could ask one other, any competitive, any new -- any changes to the competitive landscape in this segment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we really are just about the only high-performance computing, GPU computing processor company today. And the reason for that is because it's not just about having a chip, it's really about having an entire software stack, and developers who can help and work with software companies to optimize their software and having configurations that are designed to be server and enterprise caliber and enterprise ready, and having OEMs that bring these products to market. So this ecosystem is not trivial to build out, and we have a very large lead on that. And so we just have to keep getting those applications ported.\nOperator: Next in queue is CJ Muse of Barclays Capital.\nChristopher Muse - Barclays Capital: I guess, first question I was hoping, you could, I guess, elaborate a bit on the Tegra ramp and what you expect in the second half, whether we're on track for the 400 plus million? And then, I guess, in terms of mix, what kind of mix do you see between handsets and tablets, as you think about what the revenue stream would look like over the next 3, 4, 5 quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess it's probably about -- just on the mix question first, it's about 2/3 phones, and 1/3 tablets. Just because there's just so many phones. And we now have 53 SKUs of phones that are shipping. There'll be more phones shipping next quarter, and then there will be more phones shipping the quarter after that, new phones. And so that -- those are really the only indicators that I know because we're pretty new to this business, CJ, and we ramped it up pretty hard, and we have a whole lot of new design wins on Tegra 2, and we have a whole lot of new design wins on Kal-El. And so the only thing that I can watch is how many design wins do we have? And are they high-quality design wins from high-quality customers and OEMs? And when the phones and the devices come out, are they well-positioned? Are they really well-designed? And are they well-positioned as a product? And then, after that, we really don't know how to judge at the moment how well these devices will do. In terms of is the business on track, I would say that the business is doing better than on track in a sense that our design win momentum is better than ever. And Kal-El, it's going to be world's first quad-core processor. And it's so much higher performance than Tegra 2 and at so much lower power. And very few people have internalized that Kal-El is lower power in every use case compared to Tegra 2. And so this is, it's really a great breakthrough based on the technology we call variable SMP, variable symmetric multiprocessing, that makes it possible for us to achieve much higher performance where performance is needed and much lower power in almost everything that you do.\nChristopher Muse - Barclays Capital: That's very helpful. I guess, as my follow-up, I guess curious, if I look at the midpoint of the revenue guidance, it's about $50 million sequentially. And you talked about the Sony royalties being up again in October. And it sounds like design win-wise, the Tegra ramp is coming. Is it fair to say that at least 50% of the revenue uptick is coming from the consumer products division?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, what you didn't pick up in Karen's comments was that underneath that is a chipset business that's declining. And so our growth is actually more than a $50 million quarter-to-quarter in the core businesses.\nChristopher Muse - Barclays Capital: Sure. But I guess, all right, I guess, we add the decline in chipset. Is it fair to say that 50% is coming from the consumer side, or no?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't think so. I think the numbers are -- our other businesses are so large in total dollar amounts, GeForce is growing, Quadro is growing, Tesla is growing. And Tegra, we'll see how it goes.\nOperator: You have a question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Along the lines of the last caller, so Jen-Hsun, you talked about enterprise for Q3. You talked about your GPU business. Embedded within your assumptions for the third quarter, are you guys expecting consumer to be up, down or flat sequentially in Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're expecting it to be up.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Up. Okay, great.\nKaren Burns: DSP will be up as well. DSP is more significantly up.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The enterprise business?\nKaren Burns: That's right.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, great. And then my follow-up questions on...\nJen-Hsun Huang: On the chipset business, all of our businesses next quarter are expected to be up.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then in your prepared comments, Jen-Hsun, I think within consumer, you had mentioned Tegra as being sort of a steady contributor in Q3. Should we take that to mean flat growth quarter-over-quarter? Or how should we interpret your comments there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You should interpret it as a flat, and we're hopeful for more.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Got it, okay. Then one last question, on the new baseband business. The Icera team was downplaying its 450 baseband processor. This is the, I believe it's the 3G chip with voice capability. Can you just give us an update on the progress? Does the team have design wins? And when do you think you're going to start taking this to production?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have design wins in smartphones with a modem. And our expectation is that we would have our first smartphone with Icera modem in it about the Q1 timeframe of next year. We are nearly 100% passing on voice in all the major carriers and infrastructures. And we are 100% pass on LTE.\nOperator: Next in queue is Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Jen-Hsun, good job on the graphics side, especially with the share gains, and also on the attach rate. But just wanted to get your perspective on how should we think about it going forward, share gains and the attach rate, given that Sandy Bridge ramp is probably going to slow down? And then I had a follow-up for Karen as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, if you look at the GPU business overall, over the course of the last 5 years, it grew from about 100 million consumer GPUs to 150 million this last year. We're at 150 million run rate. My expectation is that the overall GPU business, if you include the 2 pieces that we have a very large position on, that we by and large drive in the industry, the enterprise GPU business of Quadro and Tesla. If you combine those 2 with the consumer GPU business, the overall GPU business to us should grow faster than that. And so my sense is that the GPU business is going to continue to grow. And how big is it going to be in the coming years is kind of hard to say. But it's grown 100 million to 150 million over the last 5 years. And there was integrated graphics all the way along, there was competition from Intel and AMD all the way along. And so I think that is probably an early -- a good indicator. And on top of that, we've added Quadro and Tesla as growth vehicles for us in the overall GPU business. Our expectation next quarter is to grow share, and we'll come back and report it next quarter how well we do.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, Jen-Hsun, and before I turn to Karen, I'm assuming you're refusing to answer the $400 million to $600 million targets. So we should assume that, that's off the table?\nRob Csongor: The $400 million to $600 million for Tegra is the number...\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, how would we -- we don't guide that far out. So come Q4, I'm going to confirm or deny it.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Fair enough, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're only literally 2 quarters into the shipment of Tegra. And there's 2 quarters left in the year, 2 big seasons left. So we're looking forward to them.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And Karen, on OpEx, how should we think about -- I just wanted to make sure I understood. Including Icera, how should we think about OpEx versus revenue growth for the following 2 quarters?\nKaren Burns: Following which quarters?\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: For the following quarters, post the one that you're guiding to?\nKaren Burns: So we don't guide beyond the next quarter.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I understand, but how should we think about it? Icera, you said, is slightly dilutive. But then you also said that you would be also investing for new products, and then you have the Project Denver investment also ahead of you. So if you put that, lay that against your long-term target that you had laid out at the Analyst Day, how should we think of the target versus that, that you had laid out?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I guess I'm not sure that I understand the question myself. We've guided for next quarter, and we typically guide one quarter out.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: So you're not, so that's nothing beyond that...\nJen-Hsun Huang: Nothing irregular happening beyond that.\nOperator: You have a question from Chris Caso of Susquehanna.\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Just a question on the Consumer Products business. And I guess, if we take out the Tegra business, it appears that, that's up very significantly on a year-over-year basis. Could you give us some color on what we may be missing there? What we may not be factoring in? And then if you could remind us of the consumer business, again, excluding Tegra, what the normal seasonality for that business is? I think it's normally seasonally down in January quarter. Should we model in a sharper seasonal decline, given that it's at higher levels now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Embedded entertainment is expected to do well next quarter. And we've had embedded entertainment businesses for quite a long time. These are -- consider them slot machines or entertainment machines like that. And our embedded business is likely to continue to grow over time. And the reason simply, reason being that you see displays all over the world in arcades, in malls, and these large displays need to have great graphic processors. And it's nice to -- we have a full platform that is with a great operating system on top of it that embedded customers could use. The embedded business will also grow into auto. We've already announced that starting next year, Audi would be 100% NVIDIA. And there will be many, many cars, other car companies to follow beyond that. And so I think our embedded business is going to continue to grow. We're expecting next quarter, specifically to your question, next quarter, we're expecting embedded entertainment to grow as well.\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And then just moving on with respect to the notebook business. And obviously, listening to others, there's been some fairly cautious commentary about the notebook market in general in the second half of the year. What's your expectations with respect to share gains? We also -- the Mercury numbers, which had you gaining some share. Do your expectations in the second half assume additional share gains of kind of additional, of similar magnitude? Could you give us some color there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don't know what's going to happen in the second half completely yet until it's done. For now, we -- our expectation is that we will gain share in the second half. How much, we don't know yet. And what was the other question? The notebook market, We're seeing all the same commentary that you see in notebooks. And my sense to what's happening is that the netbook part of the market, and the entry-level part of the notebook market is probably under a lot of pressure from tablets. And so in that part of the market, our computing strategy, our strategy is to build tablets, processor for tablets. The segment market that seems to be still relatively robust is the high-end part of the notebook market. As you know, our tablet is really wonderful, but it's no comparison to a high-end notebook. And if you're a high-end notebook customer, you probably have greater computing needs and greater digital content creation needs than a netbook customer. And so I think that tablets are not really a solution for that, but much better a solution for media consumption than media creation. So that segment of the marketplace we see are relatively, relatively, relatively strong. In terms of GPU attach rate, the GPU attach rate around the world is higher than the United States by far. For example, in China, the attach rate is about 80%. And in Europe, the attach rate of GPUs in consumer PCs is about 60 some-odd percent, 60% to 70%. Here, in the United States, the attach rate is only in the 20s. And I don't know exactly why. Maybe it's because people have a greater sense of value outside the United States, maybe people have -- use their PCs for more additional content. But nonetheless, the attach rate is much, much higher outside the United States. And as you know, the growth rate of PCs outside of the United States is higher than United States. And so I think that our GPU position for consumers and high-end notebook segments are doing quite well.\nOperator: Next in queue is Craig Berger of FBR.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I guess, the first question is, can you talk about inventory in the channel or at your customers, did it go up in the second quarter? Did it go down? Or any other color you can provide around channel inventories?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Channel inventory is slightly down, and we're comfortable with the levels.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. As a follow-up, it was sort of asked a little bit more, but this baseband business, Icera, obviously, it's going to invest a lot to be active in the baseband business. How do we think about R&D as a percentage of sales, as we move out into time, not exclusive guidance, but how were you guys thinking about the investment profile in NVIDIA as we move forward? Because I get this question a lot from investors, and any color you can provide would be helpful.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We try very hard to invest what we can afford. And as a result, we focus our investments on things that either have extraordinary growth opportunities, or something that we're really, really good at. And in the case of GPUs, it's something that we're very, very good at. It has grown from 100 million to 150 million units over the last 5 years. And because it's a growth business, we're going to continue to invest in that. Now, ideally, our SoC business, the Tegra business, in combination with Icera, will start in the near future to grow faster than the R&D that we've invested it. And so that's what we're looking forward to. Hopefully, we get to a point where we're investing R&D proportional to the growth that we're experiencing.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Last question. Can you just help us understand how big are the non-Intel royalties as part of your Consumer business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It's really hard to break out anymore. Because we increasingly have unified the engineering development in our company. We have one huge soft organization, and we have a very large deal of [indiscernible] design organization. And so it's hard to figure out exactly which part of it is for Tegra and which part of it is for GeForce.\nOperator: Next up is Glen Yeung from Citi.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Just a question. If you think about all the years you've been in this business, and looking at what we're seeing in the economy now. First of all, how would you characterize your current visibility into, particularly the PC business? And then secondly, if you think, looking at what we're seeing in the economy, do you have incremental concern at this point? Or are you still relatively comfortable?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the only thing that, the only gauge that we have is bookings rate. And bookings rate is probably about as linear as I've ever remembered it for Q2. And bookings rate continues to be solid going to Q3. And so that's really about as much indicators as we have about the quality of the quarter.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Then one other question is, and I recognize it maybe hard for you to tell. But can you differentiate between what is share gain on your part versus what is the overall market? i.e. obviously, we see some softness in the PC market but we don't necessarily see it in your numbers. And so is there a way for you to slice it so we can figure out which is which?\nJen-Hsun Huang: [indiscernible] I'm having a hard time understanding your question to say something...\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: All I really want to know is how much do you think of your results are share gains versus the overall market conditions?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We gain share in notebooks. But our desktop business was about flat share. Our workstation business is about flat share. But then on the other hand, our market share in workstations is very, very high. Our share in Tesla is flat. But then, of course, our market share there is practically 100%. So the answer, I guess, to your question is we gain share notebooks and we were flat share everywhere else. And next quarter, we're expecting small gain shares, and the rest of it would be coming from the market.\nOperator: And you have a question from Uche Orji of UBS.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Let me ask you, let me start with Karen, please. Karen, on gross margins. So if I strip out the Intel payments and I get gross margins to be down on the product side, almost 300 basis points, and the royalties probably calculated about $45 million, I'm not sure whether that number is correct. But even if I put that in, then product gross margins goes on even further. So in a quarter that you've had improvements in Quadro, I'm just trying to understand why products gross margins went down? And how I should think about the outlook for product gross margins into the next quarter?\nKaren Burns: So quarter-over-quarter, product margins, excluding Intel royalties, is basically flat. We held up very strong ASPs, strong same cost. So I'm not really sure what you're looking at. Other than, of course, Icera, when you come into an acquisition, you have an accounting where you're going to basically step up your inventory to fair market value. You're not going to get a lot of lift from what we sold for Icera. So there's a little bit of drag there. But NVIDIA core is stable.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. So including, if you strip out the impact of the royalty increase, product gross margins were still flat?\nKaren Burns: Yes.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. I shall take that offline with you. Second question, Jen-Hsun, if I look at the Tegra business -- or look at the Quadro business, we finally started to see some growth there. I mean, after a few lethargic quarters. How sustainable do you think the improvement we're seeing now is? How much of it is driven by the movement to Fermi? And how much of it is just a large reaction from enterprise in terms of spending, and should we expect this to continue for a few more quarters? I'm not asking you to guide specifically. I'm just trying to understand when you have conversations with your customers, what they're telling you about [indiscernible] Quadro?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Quadro's grown from several different areas. One, you mentioned Fermi. The Fermi GPU is just so much better than the last generation and can do so much more, and so that's one. The other is that people are using workstations for more and more applications. Digital video editing is a very large market and growing. And there's just so much more digital video content being created all over the world. And the third is global expansion, whereas the developing countries used to be a manufacturing-oriented culture and economy, it's increasingly a design-oriented economy. And so in order for movies and advertisement and products to be designed in China, they need workstations to do that. And so that's a really fabulous growth opportunity for us. And so we're seeing usage of workstations in more industries than ever. We're seeing that our GPUs can do more things. At Scene Graphs [ph] this week, we demonstrated a workstation that has the ability to not only visualize, but also simulate and visualize in realtime. It's technology we call Maximus, Quadro Maximus. And so all of these vectors are growth opportunities for workstations. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised to see our workstation business continue to grow for many years to come. And just as the world continues to become more and more of a design environment, design economy, you're going to see other countries develop their capabilities and therefore they need the tools such as workstations.\nUche Orji - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, that's great. And in terms of what we should expect from Icera, I apologize if someone has asked this earlier, I dialed in a little late. But in terms of what we should expect from Icera going forward, obviously, I know you said that the contribution this last quarter wasn't material. At the moment, was the top line growth obviously coming from dongles, but what, in terms of the roadmap, should we be looking for? And would the contribution next quarter be material within the guidance you gave?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're not expecting much contribution from Icera next quarter either. The real growth of Icera is going to come from 2 things. One, as we launch our LTE MultiMode modems, their MultiMode modem is fabulous. And it's been fully tested and approved. And we're looking forward to shipping them in tablets early next year. So that's one. That's one growth. Just discrete, high-end, high-speed modems, where they have a really great expertise and something that they've been quite famous for, for a long time. The second area requires us to build a unified chip. And we're in a process of doing that. And that allows us to address the low-end part of the smartphone market with an integrated application processor and baseband. And that part of the marketplace is going to become quite large over the next several years. Analysts estimate that the mainstream smartphone market is going to grow to about 1 billion units by 2015, from a couple of 100 million units today. And so that part of the marketplace is really not well served today by anybody. And we had to go and build a highly integrated versions of application processor and modem that will address that. So those are the 2 growth opportunities for us with respect to Icera.\nOperator: And next in queue is Daniel Berenbaum from MKM Partners.\nDaniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC: If we can come back, Jen-Hsun, to your comment that you're not seeing anything unusual. Can you help me calibrate against normal seasonality? And maybe my math is just off. But I have that your October quarter is usually the strongest seasonal quarter. But it seems like we're, and I have an up 10% sequential number for normal seasonality, and you're guiding up revenues. But it seems like we're a bit light of what a normal seasonality would be. So can you just help me close that disconnect if we're not seeing anything unusual, then why is the quarter not seasonally as strong as you might expect it to be?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You have to subtract out the decline in chipset business.\nDaniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC: So that's it? So basically, can I not assume then that Tegra is growing enough to offset the chipset business? Is it all just due to chipset business declining? And if chipset business didn't decline, you'd be up kind of in a 10% range?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We'd surely be a lot more. Yes, we would grow a lot more.\nDaniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC: You would grow a lot more if the chipset business wasn't going away? Okay. Is there going to be anything left to remodel, anything left of the chipset business then after the October quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There's not much left after the October quarter.\nDaniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC: There's not much left after the October -- okay. And then I want to come back -- this question was asked, and maybe I'll try to ask it in a different way. When we look at what the OpEx model is over a long period of time, is there a way to think about where you want R&D and SG&A to be as a percentage of revenue? Because it looks like OpEx has been creeping up a little bit as a percentage of revenue. Should we expect it to creep down over the course of the next year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. And the reason for that is because we like our -- I was trying to say it earlier, we like our revenues to start contributing. And the GPU business is, of course, growing quite nicely. The SoC business growing very fast, but off a very small base. We had 0 business in Tegra, practically, a year ago, and now it's a substantial business. But even at a few $100 million dollars a year, you can't build and sustain a world-class SoC business. At this level of play, if you want to build modern Android application processors, you better get that business up to $1 billion before R&D funds itself.\nDaniel Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC: So then how long does that take?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I hope we can get there on a run rate basis some time next year. We'll try to get there as soon as we can.\nOperator: You have a question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Jen-Hsun, what is your sense of sell-through on Android tablets? Because I think the initial response was not as good. So what is changing or can change for that segment to grow and compete more effectively than Apple's iPad?\nJen-Hsun Huang: At some level, it's weird to put an injunction on a product that's not selling. And so it must be selling really well. The early products had a clumsy launch, and we already talked about that. But the Android 3.1 and 3.2 are just fabulous. And the apps all followed, and more and more apps are showing up all the time, and these devices are getting better all the time. The WiFi version came out, and now they're at $399 [ph]. And you've got thinner devices, you have lighter devices, and now you have 7-inch devices coming out. So we that's the -- and you have the transformer from ASUSTeK. That's the power of an open platform like Android. That you have all these great companies who are innovating around it. And although it started out a little clumsy, it fixed itself very quickly. And now the Android devices are selling wonderfully. And I just saw the market share data. I thought that it showed 30% and growing. And it looks like the Android tablets are a huge success.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: And I think you are showing good progress on notebook GPUs. What will it take to regain the Apple business back from AMD?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have to build a great GPU that is on schedule when they want to use it. Their rhythm is a little bit off the rhythm of the PC industry. And their cycle is a little bit off of the cycle, the rest of the industry. And so we just have to make sure that we have the right GPU for them at the right time and we'll have a good shot.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: So as you look at your roadmap, do you think you are in sync with what they might need?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I don't have any future products [ph] to announce today.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Got it. And just one last question. I think this was asked in many different ways. But if you look at operating margins. Obviously, you have all these new sales growth opportunities, but there's also the pressure on OpEx. So if you had to predict what an operating margin might do, as we talk a year from now, do you think it will be sort of at similar levels as it today? Higher or lower? Any sense of that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hope that it's higher. And the reason for that is because we like our top line to be growing faster than our investment. This last year, we had to invest in Tegra. And the Tegra investment is quite high, as you can imagine. We're building Android platforms and Windows 8 platforms. And all of these new platforms require investment. But we hope that our design wins will translate to revenues. And I'm very bullish about Windows 8, I think it's going to be an amazing operating system. Windows 8 tablets and Windows 8 clam shells that Tegra is going into, I hope will translate into real growth for our company in the second half of next year. And so the answer to your question is we like our operating margin to expand.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Got it. And just lastly, as this new Ice Cream Sandwich release come out from Android, do you think it puts more competitive pressure on you because obviously, one of your competitors has been selected as the reference of solution. And I think when you were selected as a reference solution with Honeycomb, you obviously got a very strong head start. Do you see that same kind of situation develop where your competitor might be able to get that kind of head start? Or is the situation going to be different with this new release?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we have lots of competition already. And the only 2 other players that we see these days have been in the application processor business for, well, since the beginning of Android. And so I don't know that they need a head start. In terms of Google, Ice Cream Sandwich, I don't have any comments on it. The only thing you could -- if you have questions on Ice Cream Sandwich, you should ask Google. But we have a great working relationship with Google. And we're working on Google operating system tablets and phones at every phone company and tablet company just about all over the world. And so we're looking forward to the next version, and we're expecting to be very successful with it.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. Thanks, you guys. I look forward to talking to you guys at the next conference call.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Huang. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference.

Our desktop and notebook GPU product lines exceeded internal expectations for Q1. In our Desktop business, we continue to be well-positioned in the Performance and Enthusiast categories and continue to see good momentum in China. We added to both ends of our product lineup with the additions of the GeForce GTX 550 Ti and the GeForce GTX 590. The GTX 550 Ti is the best entry-level gaming GPU for the next generation Intel systems and the GTX 590 is simply the fastest dual GPU add-in card for enthusiasts. Jon Peddie stated in Tech Watch, \"The GeForce GTX 590 is the best Overall add-in board in every parameter we measure. Compared to other dual GPU add-in boards and dual add-in GPU boards, it has the highest performance per watt, the highest performance per dollar, the lowest power consumption, the lowest noise, the biggest gain from over-clocking and the best Pmark, regular or over-clocked.\" The X11 GPUs continues to experience good growth, driven by a wave of great new games, such as the recent release of Crysis 2, and we still have many highly-anticipated titles yet to be released this year. In the 3D notebook GPUs, we expect to increase share on the Sandy Bridge platform. We felt this growth as Sandy Bridge started to ramp in April. The Sandy Bridge transition is expected to reach the 75% crossover point exiting in the second quarter and should drive another increase in both our revenue and share in the notebook GPU segment as a result. Our Consumer Products business, which includes Tegra processors and embedded products achieved record revenue of over $122 million. The record performance is due to our first group of Tegra 2-based Android products hitting the market. Among them are the MOTOROLA ATRIX and LG Optimus 2X super phone, as well as tablets like the MOTOROLA XOOM, LG Optimus Pad and G-Slate, the ASUS Eee Transformer, Dell Streak and the Acer Iconia A500. The second wave of super phones and tablets from Acer, Motorola, Toshiba and Samsung, are expected to ship in Q2. In addition, Sony announced that their S1 and S2 tablet projects will be used in Tegra 2. Based on market research from In-Stat, tablets represents the fastest-growing segment for mobile processors, with a compound annual growth rate of 124% from 2009 to 2014. We continue to drive the lead role in the Android tablet market, and expect to further solidify that position with our next generation project Kal-El base tablets hitting consumer shelves later this year. We announced this week that we will acquire Icera, a baseband and RF Technology leader. We believe this move will further accelerate our Tegra momentum and enhance our position in mobile computing, while providing another major growth target for our company. Icera is the pioneer in next generation wireless modem technologies called software-defined radio or SDR technology. They have created an ultra-low power, high-performance processors, specifically, specially designed for processing multiple modem protocols. Icera's deep execution processor known as DXP is a programmable processor designed to execute communications algorithms in extremely low power and is super elegant and is much smaller than conventional basebands. In a way, DXP is the technical equivalent of the programmable shares we invented for GPUs, which revolutionized the graphics industry. Icera has more than 550 patents granted or pending worldwide, and those products have been approved by more than 50 carriers across the globe. By combining the company's products and technology, including our Tegra processor, we expect to enhance our position as the leading player in the growing phone and tablet markets. The market for baseband processors is one of the fastest-growing segments of the technology industry, with an estimated $15 billion a year. Our immediate plans are to accelerate Icera's entry in the voice basebands, followed by the introduction of 4G, LTE-based bands. Together, we will offer the 2 most important processors that make up the modern mobile computer. Not only is this combination strategically powerful in the market, we expect it will also drive growth for both Tegra processors and Icera-based bands. Icera will leverage Tegra's momentum and deep customer engagements globally. We are very excited to welcome the Icera team to NVIDIA. They possess a great entrepreneurial spirit and inner focus with great people and great technology. They make a perfect fit with the NVIDIA team. This is a key step in our plan to be a major player in the mobile computer revolution.  With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Mike. Revenue for the first quarter was $962 million, up 8.5% sequentially. GAAP gross margin of 50.4% was a record for the third consecutive quarter. Gross margin exceeded our expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter, primarily as a result of richer product mix within our GPU systems. GAAP OpEx was $329.6 million, in line with our estimates. Combined, these results generated a GAAP net income of $135.2 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Revenue by business segment was as follows. Our GPU business was up 3.8%. Our MCP revenue was down significantly as we entered the final phase of that business, but this was more than offset by a strong growth in notebook [indiscernible]. Demand for notebook GPUs increased significantly, as OEMs ramped production of Sandy Bridge notebooks.  Our Professional business was relatively flat, gradually increased sequentially. However, our Tesla business was down relative to the prior quarter, as the fourth quarter benefited from a particular large transaction. And our Consumer business achieved record revenue, driven by our Tegra customers bringing their first Android products to the market. Turning to the balance sheet. Our inventory levels continued to be at target levels. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $381 million. Our view of the channel shows inventory within our target. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $2.73 billion, up $236 million over the prior quarter.  Excluding the Icera acquisition, our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 is as follows: Revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6% from the first quarter; GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 51.5%. We believe this is the right level for gross margins for now. This level allows us to maintain a healthy balance between growth and profitability. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $332 million and $336 million. GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14% to 16%. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Alex Gauna.[JMP Securities]\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: I was wondering, there's an investor concern out there that some of the first-generation tablets are perhaps mispositioned or mispriced. Can you maybe describe how your Tegra business is being driven, smart phone versus tablet? And as we look through the year, what percentage we should expect to come from nexgen platforms versus current generation?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The large part of our Tegra business comes from phones. The first generation of tablets initially came out from our carriers and with 3G, and I think that is recognized that the vast majority of tablet users are actually buying it from retail and Wi-Fi only. And without 3G, obviously, the tablets would be much more affordable. So I think that, that's one of the factors that affected the initial reviews of the early waves of tablets, but those concerns have been largely addressed at this point. And now, you can buy tablets from retail stores all over America. And the new wave of tablets are now ramping up that are even more affordable and available in retail channels with Wi-Fi configurations all over the world. And you're also starting to see a lot of differentiated platforms from devices that are likely ASUSTeK transformer, where it's a tablet in one configuration, it has a detachable keyboard in another configuration. And so those kind of devices are getting a lot of interest and available at computer channels all over the world. We're going to expect another wave of tablets that are coming out to the marketplace now. Ones that are even thinner and even lighter than the best offerings from any place, any supplier in the world and those devices are just in the process of ramping. Then there's the really exciting new build of Honeycomb called Honeycomb 3.1 that Google just demonstrated the other day at Google I/O. We are basically switching that up now, it's available, it will be available to end-users as over-the-air download in the very near future. And so you'll get music services, cloud music services, cloud video services, cloud book services, and there will be cloud magazine services and all kinds of really interesting offerings to be used on these tablets in the very near future. And so I think that the -- another wave of these tablets are now starting to show up around the world, but the first-generation of tablets with the over-the-air Honeycomb 3.1 that's coming out eminently are really, really fabulous and they're doing -- they're selling really well.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: I don't want to get too far ahead as my follow-up chance, and I was wondering, in addition to 3.1 at Google I/O, Ice Cream Sandwich was center stage. And I was wondering how that does or does not intersect with your quad core Kal-El? And the complexities of what Google is trying to do and what that means for your quad core technology?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're really excited about the work that they're doing on Ice Cream. And I can't comment too much more other than that, but we're working very closely with their teams on the Ice Cream Sandwich. And as all of these products -- they will come to the market when they're great, and I'm certainly expecting them to be great on this year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Romit Shah.[Nomura Securities Co.]\nRomit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: With respect to guidance for the second quarter, can you give us a sense, at least, directionally, how you see the 3 businesses trending? And also, what sort of contribution are we going to see from licensing in the July quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, let me answer the first part. The GPU business, about flattish. The Professional business, about flattish. And the Consumer business, uppish. And so and as a result of that, we're able to overcome the Q2, which tends to be seasonally down. And if you look at other people's guidances in the computer industry, Q2 was seasonally down. And so you're starting to see an expansion in our core businesses, core GPU businesses, and you're also seeing growth in our Consumer business, or Consumer Mobile business, and that's making up for the decline, the expected decline of our MCP business that we talked about now for quite some time. If you looked at our MCP business, year-over-year, it declined about $150 million, and we made up for that through the growth of our core GPU business and Tegra business this quarter. We expect another decline in our MCP business next quarter, and we're expecting to make up a lot of that again with the rest of our business. The second part of the question was?\nRomit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Just on licensing, how much licensing revenue are you guys going to see this quarter?\nKaren Burns: Incrementally, about $40 million more. So we have...\nRomit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Just a follow-up, I know you guys haven't given official guidance for Tegra for this year, but I believe publicly, you've endorsed $400 million to $600 million as a reasonable range. Is that still on the table?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we've provided guidance for the next quarter and it looks like it's going to be pretty good. And so we're looking forward to the new products coming to market with Tegra later half the year. And then also, we have the introduction of our next-generation quad core processor called Project Kal-El and so that should also contribute later in the year. So I think we're -- I would characterize the Tegra business as lifted off. And so we'll see how it goes, and will report on its progress as we go.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of James Schneider. [Goldman Sachs]\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: First of all, on the Icera acquisition, could you give us a little bit of color around the accretion, expectations you provided in the earlier press release? What revenue assumption you're assuming to make that accretive by the end of next year? And then can you talk about at what point you'll -- do you plan on introducing an integrated Tegra-plus modem in one chip or if you plan on doing that at all?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First, the answer to your first question is we expect the acquisition to be slightly dilutive for the remaining part of the year. With respect to revenue contributions, we obviously haven't completed the acquisition yet. And so we should probably comment on that when we're done with that. With respect to the integration, we have no current plans to integrate their modem. We think that the ability to offer both processors and either the 2 most important processors for mobile computing gives us the opportunity to leverage the momentum of Tegra and also the quite broad penetration they've already achieved with carriers all over the world to increase the momentum of both processors. We also see that in the vast majority of the projects that we're working on, whether it's tablets or super phones, the ability to keep the 2 processors separate allows us to mix and match the best processors for the devices that we're in. And so if you look at most of the super phones in the world today and most of the tablets in the world today, the application processor and the baseband processors are in fact, separate. And so the ability -- and then finally, the ability to integrate the 2, we surely have that capability. And we'll look at the market and look at when the technology makes sense to integrate to offer either the smallest footprint or the lowest cost. And we'll do so when the timing is right, and we surely have the capability to that now.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. Thanks, that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, with the incremental $40 million of licensing in Q2, I think that contributes about 180 basis points to gross margins, if I'm doing my math correctly, but you're guiding up your gross margins a little bit less than that. Can you talk about what's going on in terms of the business mix or pricing going to Q2 that would make that happen?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, that's our guidance for now. And Q2, obviously, there's still a lot of the quarter to do yet. And so we'll come back and report on the quarter when it's over. But that's our guidance for now.\nMichael Hara: Hey, Jim, let me add on that. To Jen-Hsun's question also, Q1, we had a nice lift from the launch of the dual GPU GTX 590. So that, we think, is what really will benefit to Q1.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike McConnell.[Pacific Crest Securities]\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Yes, just on that note, thinking about the gross margin guide, should we also think, Mike, with respect to the Notebook business, since that's going to be the gross driver within GPU and now, the GTX 590 was a driver in Q1, we should probably expect then a pretty significant drop in the GPU gross margins for fiscal Q2, is that what's kind of implied behind that?\nMichael Hara: No, actually, the notebook margins are actually pretty decent. Certainly, the costs are coming down and the margins are going -- are tracking back up. So as the Notebook business grows, it actually doesn't have as much of an effect as you think.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Okay, So it's mostly then just the GTX 590, like you talked about. So it's just a more of a normalization of the mix as you move into FQ2?\nMichael Hara: That's right.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: And then Jen-Hsun, just kind of a longer-term one, when we think about Project Denver and a lot of people think your company is going be -- the company is going to be moving ARM potentially into traditional PCs. And we talked about, talked to the incumbents that's in the traditional PC market, they make an argument that it would be very difficult for NVIDIA in ARM because this move in traditional PCs because of the standardization, the lack of standardization, the fragmented nature of the market and the ARM ecosystem. Could you talk about those hurdles, and looking at Project Denver, how those will be overcome?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, Project Denver is 2 generations away for our SoCs, our Tegra SoCs. And so there's still plenty of, a lot of time between now and the time that Project Denver will enter the market. But obviously, it has to be competitive. And the things that we do that we're really good have to matter -- and so computer graphics have to matter, parallel computing has to matter, GPU computing has to matter. And we have to build a product that really makes a difference in the marketplace. There are still a lot of ideas that we haven't introduced in Project Denver. It's probably a little bit too early. But suffice to say, that we will build a MID 2 product. You've known our company a long time, and when we introduce a product, there's usually something pretty special about it. And we expect Project Denver to carry on that tradition of delivering something innovative and special. With respect to standardization, standardization comes from compatibility with software. And the thing to keep in mind today is that the vast majority of the software developers around the world for consumer computing are increasingly evolving on ARM processors. And if you take a look at the number of devices that are being shipped today, there are far, far, far more ARM computers being shipped than there are x86 computers being shipped. And if that attracts more software developers, then there's more rich software being developed for ARM that over time, you would think that ARM becomes the most valuable platform for enjoying the software. And so that's how standardization happens, and you know how fast mobile computing and the Internet in these application stores is causing new platforms to make a difference. I mean, it was only a few years ago that these ARM-based, either iPhones or Android phones, came to the marketplace and just look at how many applications have been downloaded and how many gigabytes have been downloaded of applications. And this is just the first few years. The next few years is about to happen to us, and it's growing at exponential rates. And so I think that's what standardization is all about, and I think it's a pretty much foregone conclusion that ARM is just going to be probably the most important standard for application, for consumers, anyhow.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Arnab Chanda.[Roth Capital Partners]\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: Just a couple of questions. First of all, historically, you've been basically on the digital side. Icera, has won the physical on their side and they never succeed in voice. Can you talk why you think you'll able to take that or are you going to have to start a design from scratch to migrate with that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Arnab, as soon as we figure out what you said, I'm going to answer it. There was a -- you broke up.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: Okay, sorry. I was just saying, in the Icera acquisition, historically, you've been more on the digital side. They are more of a baseband physical supply, never been in the voice market, which is a lot harder than data. What are you going to do to take them in there? Do you have to design a new chip or can you talk a little bit about that?\nMichael Hara: Yes, that's a good question. I mean, that's what's really special about the Icera architecture. This is one of the worlds, if not, the world's first unified software defined radio-based baseband. I mean, in a way, they've designed baseband processors, this multi-protocol baseband processors the same way we've designed our GPUs that allows for multiple effect shading. And as a result of that, through software upgrades, they're able to provide voice capabilities. They have the full TPPCom stacked for voice -- I mean, this isn't being done from scratch. The Icera team, based in France, is one of the reputed teams in voice, and this is -- these guys have done it for years and years. And they're starting from the baseband -- of the software stack of TPPCom which is the starting point for a lot of basebands today for voice. And so -- and also, they're making, they've made incredible progress already. We haven't introduced the product yet but we expect that the path to getting there is pretty well known at this point. There's still a lot of development to be done, Arnab, and surely this is -- there's a lot of execution to do. But it's not easy, but that's kind of the exciting stuff. Icera has invested nearly $300 million between in all of their, in all their different realms of financing and have created a pretty terrific starting point for us. And so between these 2 processors now, the Tegra processor and the Icera baseband and their RF, we have 2 of the most important pieces for mobile computing and we'll start it from there.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: Just a follow-up on the Tegra business. You are obviously the lead partner for Honeycomb. It sounds like for Ice Cream, maybe Ti is. Now is that going to put you at a disadvantage or maybe you're ahead in quad core and that helps you? Can you talk a little bit about what happens in the next generation?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I'm not exactly sure what Ti's talking about, but they're obviously making a lot of it for nothing. But we're working very closely with Google on Ice Cream Sandwich, and it's a very important new generation of operating system based on starting from the Honeycomb base and I'm expecting it to be really terrific. And so we're working very closely with the Google team, and Tegra will be surely be wonderful for Ice Cream when it comes.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: And then just last question on ARM in Windows. When -- should we expect that to happen reasonably soon? And what time should we be looking for that and is that even likely?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Arnab, for Windows, I can't report on the Windows plan. That'll have to come from Microsoft. But we're working very closely with their teams. Their -- the progress is fabulous. And you know that we have one of the best Windows software development teams in the world anywhere. And this team is not only experienced, they have a starting point of quite a bit of assets that has been created over the years. And it's also very, very large in scale. This is a software team that has the ability to support a few hundred notebook designs per cycle in OEMs all over the world. And it's the -- aside from us and AMD, that such a team does not exist. And so we are beneficial and able to bring this team to Windows on ARM. And this is one of our ways to, one of our differentiators really, for the PC OEMs and mobile companies who would like to get into the space. And so I'm expecting Windows 8 to be fabulous, and we're working very closely with Microsoft on it.\nArnab Chanda - Roth Capital Partners, LLC: Thanks, Jen-Hsun, seems like the future you've been waiting for is getting closer and closer.  Your next question is coming from the line of Vivek Arya. [BofA Merrill Lynch]\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Jen-Hsun, I'm curious, what's driving the flattish trends in the Professional Solutions businesses? Is it just the timing of projects? Is it something else? And what would it take to sort of reinvigorate growth in that segment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Frankly, I wish our Professional business was growing faster, too. And we're spending a lot of time on that particular topic ourselves. There are several reasons for that. One, the workstation industry needs to be reinvigorated with new capabilities, and that's one of the reasons why we built Fermi. Fermi, the Fermi GPU brings a level of capability and functionality to the workstation industry it never had before. And we're in the process of rolling out those capabilities into the marketplace. We call it internally the Fermi transition. By making computer graphics, not just about OpenGL, but about CUDA and computational capabilities, we could bring things like -- capabilities like photorealistic rendering, the ability to do simulation and visualization at the same time, the ability to do image processing at a much, much higher rate. And so a large group of industries from design to styling, to broadcast, to seismic analysis, whether you're in oil and gas, to imaging for medical, there's all kinds of applications where Fermi is really transformative. And so we're in the process of introducing these capabilities into the Professional markets, and that is what we call the Fermi transition. Until we do that, I think that the worst station marketplace is growing basically at the rate of GEPs. And so we need to reinvigorate that growth to new capability. So that's one. The second is the Tesla business needs to continue to get application adoption and to continue to get those applications accelerated through CUDA. And we're making excellent progress there. And the OEMs are now engaging customers all over the world with what we call proof of concepts. And there's a large number of projects in the pipeline. And so HP, Dell, IBM, SuperMicro and many others are working with large companies to get these projects certified, qualified and then ramped up. And so I think part of that has simply -- has to do with the time that it takes a large enterprise to understand the capabilities of the supercomputing workstations and supercomputers servers and then also to get it certified and rolled out into their companies. But I certainly expect that to happen.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: Is that where you think something that's standing between the gross margin outlook you have in the near term versus getting to sort of the mid-50s gross margin that I think has been alluded to before from an overall company perspective?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There's no question that unless the Professional business grows, our gross margin will not grow with it. And so that's -- the NVIDIA Professional Solutions group is completely aware of this, and everybody is working hard to get growth happening. This is something that the growth is not, nothing, no competition is in the path of our growth. This is innovation that will be necessary to grow this business for us and grow this business for all of the OEMs around the world. The Workstation business is frankly waiting for us to bring the innovations that have been designed into Fermi, in CAT tools from [indiscernible] and Autodesk, medical imaging companies all over the world. And they're waiting for us to roll this out into the world. And when that -- when we do that, growth will happen for us and will happen for the OEMs. And the same thing for Tesla. When the proof-of-concept is complete and all of these projects in the pipeline are rolled out into production, it will happen, it will generate growth for us and it will generate growth for the OEMs. And so both us and all of our OEM partners and all of our software partners are all intensely focused on bringing this level of innovation to the marketplace so we can all grow.\nVivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch: And one last question, if I may. Do you think Tri-gate Technology is a viable technology for mobile? And could it even become table stakes next year? And if yes, how do you think you or your foundry partners are positioned to deliver it?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the FinFET, which is the industry technical term for what is now a marketing term called the 3D Gate, has been on the horizon now for many semiconductor company for some time. And this has been one of the next steps in the advancement of semiconductors. There were talks of [indiscernible] technology; Is now, I guess, yesterday in the metal gate and all of those things are needed to advance semiconductor technology and many others. And so this is just one of the next-generation technologies and semiconductor companies around the world, from TSMC, to GLOBALFOUNDRIES to others, Samsung to others, obviously, has to continue to innovate in order to make semiconductor technology continue to advance, and I fully expect it to. Now in the terms of -- in case of -- your question actually has a larger question, which is how important is semiconductor technology to Mobile Advance? And the answer is a great deal. I mean, without semiconductor technology, how could we have any advance? Whether it's desktop computers or workstations or servers or cell phones, the answer is, of course, very important. But for mobile processors, by far the greatest contributor to low power and efficient performance is architecture. It is the encore. It is the SoC. It is everything that is not the CPU core as well as the CPU core and the process technology and the software technology and the operating system and everything above that. All of it has to come together to deliver on an extraordinary experience, not just the transistor. It's important, but it's just one part of the overall equation.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Daniel Berenbaum. [Auriga USA]\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: I was hoping you can calibrate me a little bit on the graphic segment compared to where it was. If I look back at where your GPU plus chipset, back when you used to break it out, that peaked at around $900 million on a quarterly basis. And right now, that segment, if I back out the royalties, seems to be at about $615 million or so. Do you ever expect to get back to that $900 million or -- I mean, as chipset goes away, do you expect that segment to get back to that $700 million stand-alone GPU number? Or are we sort of asymptotically approaching something below that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, maybe the easier question to answer is do we expect growth from our GPU business? And the answer is, first of all, yes. And the reason why it's yes is, as you guys may remember, we were not as fast to the DX11 generation as our competition. We lost that step there. And we paid for it early on a couple of years ago, if you recall. And so it took us a while to recover from that position with Fermi. And the first implementation of Fermi, as you recall, wasn't as graceful as we all wanted it to be. And so we had a lot of catching up to do, and we reevaluated the way that we design our chips. We reorganized our engineering, so that we could be more efficient. And we came back really, really strong with the second generation of Fermi and started to gain share again. In the notebook space, the DX11 notebook space, we've been gaining share from our low a couple of quarters ago. And we should improve this quarter, we can improve next quarter and improve even more in the quarter after that. And so I think that our GPU business has every opportunity for growth, and we're expecting it to grow and we have to in the digital computer.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: Okay. And that kind of, I mean, that kind of addresses the share or point. And clearly, you guys have executed well on technology to regain market share there, but maybe comment on the market side. And I guess do you think just realistically that the market ever could be big enough with your share gains to get you back to above that $700 million level on a quarterly basis?\nJen-Hsun Huang: On an overall level of GPUs, I think the answer is it's likely that the overall GPU market is larger than it ever was. The GeForce consumer side has attached -- the GPU attach, has stabilized and the fastest growing part of GPU attach is China. It also happens to be the fastest growing segment of PCs. And so that's a positive factor. In the Workstation space, we want to reinvent and redefine the workstation and bring digital computing to a new level there with CUDA and computational computer graphics. And of course, in the servers, where we invented a technology called CUDA and used in servers for accelerating applications, numerically intensive applications. And so the server market becomes a large business opportunity for us. And we have several ideas yet that we're going to introduce to the world to increase the adoption of GPUs. And so I think that if you look at the overall GPU market, there's no question it has an opportunity to grow yet.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up on the mechanical question. Would you guys care to hazard a guess on tax rate for the remainder of the year.\nKaren Burns: For the remainder of the year, we've guided at 15%.\nDaniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA LLC: So that'll be the full year, 15%?\nKaren Burns: That's right.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Uche Orji. [UBS]\nUnknown Analyst - : First question here. This is Steve, LSQ. First question is on the Quadro business. In the past, you would look to the creative professional as one of the growth drivers. Can you give us a sense of what's happening with GPUs in the Adobe Creative Suite world? And given that you showed some pretty compelling demos in the past, why do you think the uptake is not driving that type of growth that you had talked about in the past?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we think there's about 1 million or so digital video professionals that -- or creative professionals, that use video and probably another 3 million or so that are prosumers. And those 3 million prosumers, probably a whole lot of them already use GeForce. And we just have to keep evangelizing so that they understand how to get the best possible performance from it. But the million, some of them use Final Cut Pro, and that hasn't been optimized for CUDA. And a lot of them use Adobe. And some of them use Sony. And some of them use ABIT. And so GPU acceleration is being incorporated into almost all of them in the near future. And so as more and more of the different suite become GPU accelerated, my expectation, or our expectation, is that the consumers will -- the creative professionals, will incorporate. And so I think it's just a matter of time, and that I just gave you the scope of the overall market opportunity. But over time, I expect those 4 million video users, video editing users, professionals, are all going to be GPU accelerators. And that's one of the reasons why we expect Quadro and GeForce to continue to grow because it's just such a compelling benefit to use GPU acceleration and video editing.\nUnknown Analyst - : Just following along on that in PSP, with Tesla, I know there is a prior question, but if you think about the lumpiness of the business that you referred to in the commentary suggest that we're still in the early adopter phase, what are some of the milestones you're looking towards to crossing the chasm here into the commercial space such that we get a less lumpy type of business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes that's in -- and that's the perfect observation. We are still in the still early adoption phase with a foundation of industry by industry by industry by industry that is being built up. There's an overlay, if you will, of baseline business in Tesla that is just strong. It's not huge yet, but it's building. We feel it every single month, there's sell-through every single month, it's in every single geography and there's pick up every single month, just steady pick up every single month. Overlay it with some very large deals every now and then, as data centers gets built out for a high-performance computer. And today, we just really can't build out a supercomputer without GPU acceleration. Because otherwise, the computational capability is just so low relative to anything else that's been built. It's really not possible to have something like that built. And so I think that the supercomputing centers, the store, if you will, the basic baseline run rate of the business. But that's still says that the baseline run rate business from each industry still needs to be developed and we still need to continue to support applications, which we're actively doing and the industry is working with us very, very hard to make sure that their applications are accelerated by our GPUs because the benefits are just so overwhelming. And then when you see 5x to 10x acceleration of an application by porting a small part of the code, you port 10% of the code and you get to 5x, 10x acceleration, that's just really, really too compelling to ignore, especially for people who use their workstations to advance research or for advanced time to market as a positive only, and so one industry after another, we're porting those applications. And then there's the idea of -- and more and more people are seeing their workstations becoming really not just for visualization, but for simulation as well. And I think that that's going to be a large opportunity for us. There's several million workstations sold per year. When those workstations become supercomputing workstations and are used for simulation as well as visualization, I think we're going to see a really significant market opportunity for us, and that's what we're driving towards.\nUnknown Analyst - : Last quick question here. Just now that you're going to have a baseband shortly, do you see the need to acquire connectivity or NFC or GPS that some of your competitors have?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our focus is to make sure that we have the most important pieces of the mobile platform. The application processor and the baseband or the wireless communications processor are the 2, by far, the most important processors on the mobile platform. And the reason for that is because there's so much software to do. The rest of the connectivity devices are important, surely, no doubt, but it's available from a lot of different players. They are basically standards. The software stack is pre-standardized. And there's a great deal of interoperability. And so I think these 2 processors are, by far, the most important processors, and that's our focus.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Glen Yeung. [Citigroup]\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Somewhere in your discussion, you mentioned China and the attached rates there. There seems to be some controversy over what we're seeing in emerging markets in general and what the overall PC environment looks like. I wonder if you can just shed any light you may have on the overall PC environment.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't know that we have any new insight over what's happening in the emerging markets. China is very different than other emerging markets, though. The dynamics of China versus those of India or Brazil are very, very different. China has -- is the home of some of the -- of most gamers in the world, and it is the fastest growing game market. And the game market is growing incredibly fast with virtual goods on top of that. And it's just a very, very fast evolving marketplace for gamers. And they're not just playing leftover games from the West, but they're really revolutionizing new business models. And when games are free and they're as enjoyable as they are, obviously, it's going to attract a lot of new players.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: And then thinking about the relationship that you have with Sandy Bridge, which in the April quarter was quite good. As Intel migrates that down the stacks of its processors, how do you think your attach rates will trend? Or another way of saying that is, did you happen to see a very strong attached rate out of the gate because there was a very high end oriented ship out of the gate?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that the important thing is to realize that there's more than just technology at play and -- our CPU technology at play. I mean, there's a segment in the marketplace that really prefers to have the best graphics performance and the best graphics experience. And just as there are baseline cars and premium cars, there are going to be baseline PCs and premium PCs. And in the premium PCs, the best way to create a premium PC and to deliver a premium experience that is a meaningful step up from the baseline PC is to add a GPU. Higher resolution displays and a state-of-the-art GPU with our Optimus technology is really, really the best way to create a premium experience and create a premium PC. And so I think that, that method of creating great products is not going to go away. And I think just as there are some consumers who would like to have a premium platform, given a choice, there are OEMs that would like to create premium platforms to serve that marketplace. And I think the GPU is unknown all over the world to be, by far, the best way to do that.\nGlen Yeung - Citigroup Inc: Can I actually just follow-up on that comment? Because I agree with you. I think we can see -- and high-end notebooks today are really premium paid for having a GPU, a discrete GPU and not in having better screen technology and not. But are you seeing a scenario now where people are to sort of maintain the wallet for the PC build are actually downscaling the CPU in favor of an architecture that favors the GPU and screen technology a bit more?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We see a lot of different architectures around the world. There are people who use Core i7s with the GeForce. There are people who use Core i5s with the GeForce, there are people who use the Pentium Dual-Core with the GeForce. And so what you just described is a characteristic of the different architectures all over the world. And that's how the PC industry differentiates, by creating the best product for certain niches of the marketplace, and there's a lot of different issues, a lot of different geographies with very, very different tastes. And so I think what you described there is exactly what happens.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Craig Berger. [FBR Capital Markets]\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: On the Icera acquisition, I mean, getting in the baseband and addressing all of the global standards and countries is a pretty large undertaking. So how do you think that changes your R&D investment profile over the coming years? How many heads might you have to scale into this effort?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That's a good question. That's exactly the reason why we decided not to start an effort from scratch. Icera is -- has carrier relationships all over the world. As you know, they already sold millions of modems and growing very, very fast. And so this is a team that has relationships with Nokia and GTE and Samsung. And they have carrier relationships with AT&T and Vodafone and Orange, and so the list is pretty broad. And so that's exactly the reason why we decided to acquire Icera, a company that has invested some nearly $300 million of investment into it.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. So we'll have to wait on the more specifics. Can you talk about in....\nJen-Hsun Huang: Craig, I also told you, with respect to additional investment, we expect the Icera acquisition to be slightly or very slightly diluted, which tells you how we think about the growth of the business and the additional investment that we have to make through it.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Thanks for that. Can you give us some color on the state of Tegra design wins lately and what that tells you about that business opportunity, say, 12 months from now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're still engaged in design wins on both Tegra 2 and Tegra or Project Kal-El. We have quite a large number of Project Kal-El design wins for tablets and phones. And simultaneously, we're doing refreshes of Tegra 2 super phones, while we're also developing new, more affordable mainstream phones. And so those, all of those things are happening at the same time. We're also getting designed into more and more cars and which is an important growth opportunity starting with next year and looking at a larger and larger number of smart TV opportunities, which requires the software stack, the rich software stack, that we've developed for Tegra. So design wins are going all the time.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Last question, are you guys able to provide cash from operations? Usually, you guys have the cash flow in the report. And also, do you consider stock comp expense to be part of your core operations or not?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Karen, let's -- for the cash, cash from operations. Surely, we think about stock-based compensation or the use of RSUs and stock options very, very carefully. And the reason for that is because of dilution factors and because it does have value to the employees. And then on -- and Karen, on the cash flow? I recall that was something like $180 million or so, plus or minus, something like that.\nKaren Burns: Well, for the year, it was $235 million. From operation, I have to get that from the cash flow statement.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thanks, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. We'll get that, yes.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso. [Susquehanna Financial Group]\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I just wonder if you could clarify back on some of the opening comments with the gross margin, and I think the comment was you think that was the right range for now. Could you give a little more color on that? And then perhaps, as we go through the year, just remind us where the mix levers are with respect to those gross margins.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think Karen wants to answer a question real quick, and then I'll get to that one.\nKaren Burns: Yes. Cash flow from operations is $199 million.\nJen-Hsun Huang: And then with respect to gross margins, at this point, we feel pretty comfortable with the gross margins where it is as it's always a balance between that, more profitability and more growth. And we think that we are in positions in the marketplace that allows us to grow quite rapidly. And so we want to get there as quickly as we can. And so this is -- there's always a fine balance, but this is a good balance for now. Some of the areas that could accelerate our gross margins further are Professional Solutions businesses, both Quadro and Tesla. If we can get those 2 businesses growing as we expect to, when it does at a much more significant rate, it will contribute to gross margin improvement in a much more significant way. And so those are 2 of the businesses that we're counting on for growth and we're working incredibly hard to get the new technologies that we've created into the marketplace and so that the market can embrace it and drive our next generation of growth for PSG. Okay?\nChristopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: All right. And just as a follow-up, and it sounded like with regard to the Tegra business, the majority of that revenue, I guess, for the first half of the year is coming from the cell phone space. How do you see that, well, if you could confirm that? And just as you go through the year, what you see as the mix between tablets and smart phones and tablets become a substantial part of the mix as you go in the second half.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We expect phones and tablets to both contribute to Tegra's growth. And so the exact percentages are hard to say. And they will change from quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether it's a phone cycle or a computing cycle. And so I think that, it's suffice to say, that tablets is one of the fastest growing segments of the computer industry. And whether a tablet is a notebook or a notebook is a detachable tablet or transformable tablet, it's really increasingly hard to say. And so I think the growth opportunities for tablets, obviously, is still quite significant ahead of it, and this is an area where we can make a large contribution. On the other hand, the smart phone marketplace is really just begun. There's only -- it only represents the top tier of the overall phone marketplace today. And yet, we all know that someday, every single phone will be a smart phone. Instead of just a couple of hundred million smart phones a year, it would rather represent the full billion units of phones around the world that are sold every year. Every phone in the world in the near future will have the ability to access the Internet and enjoy content and otherwise. So that's an enormous growth opportunity for us and one of the reasons why Icera's so important to us. Okay?\nOperator: And that is all the time we have for questions. Now Mr. Hara, do you have any final thoughts?\nMichael Hara: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to talking to you next quarter about our Q2 results. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release which is posted on our website. With that let's begin. We are pleased to report a record year for the company. Despite significant headwinds, we achieved record annual revenues and gross margins for fiscal year 2013. Excluding chipset revenue, which we exited, we grew our GPU business 8% last year and for the third consecutive year. We increased overall GPU market share from 53% to 65% and our notebook share by almost 20 percentage points from 47% to 66%. Tegra, Tesla, and notebook GPUs all achieved record revenue. We invested in new growth products that are now sampling, including Tegra 4, i500 4G LTE modem, Project Shield, [NGRID], while controlling OpEx at target for the year. This year we transitioned Kepler across our GPU businesses. Gaming was a key area to benefit. Massively multiplayer games or MMOs continued to drive a robust PC gaming market. Worldwide MMO revenues grew 21% last year to $13 billion according to market research firm Newzoo. And GeForce is the gamers choice of GPU by a margin of almost 2:1 according to gamers on steam. Our notebook share is a near a record high. Kepler is also starting to ship into Quadro with revenues up 10% this quarter. With Tesla, we are leveraging GPUs beyond graphics into massively parallel processing in supercomputers. Just three years after we entered the market, 50 of the world's top 500 fastest computers are now powered by Nvidia GPUs, including the fastest and most energy efficient. We introduced Nvidia GRID visual computing appliances. GRID is a first of its kind graphics system that serves graphics intensive applications to many concurrent users at once. One of the major applications is cloud gaming. More than a dozen cloud gaming trials are up and running around the world and others will be announced by more TELCOs as the year progresses. At CES, we announced Tegra 4, the world's fastest mobile processor. It is the first four plus one quad-core A15 processor with an extra energy saving core and 72 graphics cores, compared with Tegra 3\u2019s 12 cores. It delivers the world\u2019s fastest web browsing performance and new, always-on, high dynamic range computational photography. At this point in time, we already have more design wins with Tegra 4 than we had in total with Tegra 3. We see significant new growth opportunities in the LTE connected device market which is projected to be 150 million units in 2013 and growing at 50% a year. We are now sampling our i500 4G LTE multi-band multi-mode voice and data modem. More efficient and 40% the size of conventional modems, i500 delivers four times the processing capability of its predecessor. This is the first result of our Icera acquisition. Icera is the first company to successfully create and commercialize a software-defined radio modem and has been building modems since 2006. And we announced Project Shield, an Nvidia branded open platform gaming device. A pure Android device connected to the Google Play store and Tegra Zone, Project Shield is able to play any Android application and game and can also stream PC games from a nearby GeForce GTX PC. Powered by a Tegra 4 processor, Project Shield integrates a five inch retinal display, a console grade game controller and a first mobile tuned port bass reflex speakers. We believe Shield will be attractive to modern gamers who want to play on open platforms and have great gaming experiences, while untethered to their TVs or PCs. Shield will enhance the strategic position of Tegra. Besides highlighting the capabilities of Tegra, Shield will attract great games to Tegra Zone which can then be enjoyed on every Tegra powered device. Tegra Zone has already been downloaded 6 million times. Looking forward, our company is shifting gears to accelerate. Our GPU business remains strong while we extend our visual computing technology leadership. Tegra 4 is ramping into production for mobile devices this year while growing into embedded devices such as cars and gaming devices. We will engage the LTE connected devices market aggressively this year and we will add new system products incorporating our processors and software, the Nvidia Grid graphics appliances and Shield Android gaming device. We are excited by the investments we\u2019re making into these very large markets where our expertise in visual computing can make any contributions. With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks Rob. Nvidia had record revenue for the year of $4.3 billion, up 7% from fiscal 2012. At the start of the year, we set out a number of financial objectives. It\u2019s satisfying to note that we achieved many of them. Among these goals were the following. Game share and our GPU business. Driven by the introduction of our new Kepler architecture, we gained share in both desktop and notebook and delivered record revenue for our notebook products. Gross Tegra revenue at least 50%. Revenue for Tegra products sold into smartphones and tablets increased by $181 million to a record $541 million, up 50% year on year. Grow Quadro and Tesla revenue. Revenue for Tesla products increased 37% year on year as we shipped our first Kepler products, Tesla K10 in Q3 and Tesla K20 in Q4. Quadro revenue was down roughly 6% year on year. In October we shipped Quadro K5000, our first Kepler based Quadro product in limited volume. This year, we will launch Kepler for Quadro in volume top to bottom into the professional market. We expect Kepler for both Quadro and Tesla to do very well. Exit the year with gross margin of approximately 52%. We exceeded our targeted exiting Q4 with a gross margin of 52.9% and non-GAAP of 53.2%. We had record gross margin for the full year with GAAP gross margin at 52%, up 60 basis points from the previous year and non-GAAP gross margin up 52.3%, up 40 basis points. Manage our OpEx investments at approximately $1.56 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.4 billion for GAAP OpEx was $1.58 billion, up $20 million from our original expectations. This was due to a $20 million expense for a corporate donation made in the second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excluded this $20 million charge as well as stock-based compensation and acquisition related cost, we successfully managed to our target of $1.4 billion. Before moving on, I would like to provide more background on OpEx as we continue to invest in our key growth strategy. Our OpEx is comprised primarily of employee related costs. This includes compensation and benefits as well as other related expenses and supporting costs, largely infrastructure for facilities and IT equipment. GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx were both at 12% from fiscal 2012. Also the year-on-year OpEx increase for GAAP, 86% related to the these employee related costs. 12% to contribution expense or corporate donation, and 2% related to all other costs. With non-GAAP OpEx excluding the contribution expense as well as stock-based comp an acquisition related costs which were flat year-over-year, 98% of the increase came from employee and supporting infrastructure cost. The remaining 2% related to all other operating expenses. We are investing in the new products and major growth opportunities Rob talked about. i500, Project Grey, N Shield and Nvidia GRID. We added about 840 new staff in fiscal 2013, giving us a total of nearly 8000 employees at the end of the year. Of our new staff, 88% joined our engineering team, 12% joined our operations and SG&A organization. We also invested in an annual pay increase for existing employees and began a 410(k) match in Q4. We believe our focused investment and our growth strategies and our core businesses are critical to our future growth. Now on to revenue by business segment for the full fiscal year. Beginning this quarter, we changed our financial reporting segments to reflect the way we are now managing our business. We now have two primary reporting segments. GPU and Tegra processor. This new segmentation recognizes that we have two fundamental technologies, GPUs and SSDs, which we leverage across several markets under different brands. Revenue for the GPU business, which includes GeForce, Quadro and Tesla based GPUs, was at 2% year-on-year. This increase was achieved despite $173 million decline in chipset products which we discontinued. Excluding chipset product revenue, our GPU business grew 8%, representing our third consecutive year of GPU growth. Revenue for the Tegra processor business was up almost 30% from the previous year. Driven by the 50% increase in revenue for Tegra's sales shipped into smartphones and tablets including Win RT devices referenced earlier. Full details of our new reporting segment as well as historical revenue segmentation can be found in my CFO commentary posted on our website. Now I would like to talk briefly about the fourth quarter. Apart from our tax rate, Q4 results were in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Revenue was $1.11 billion, down 8% sequentially and up 16% year-on-year. Gross remained at record levels. GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, non-GAAP was 53.2%. Operating expenses were $402 million for GAAP and $360 million for non-GAAP. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were both below our expectations at roughly 7% in Q4, as we benefited from the extension of the U.S. research tax credit. Extension of this credit was enacted during our fourth quarter, bringing our effective tax rate down for the year to roughly 15% for GAAP and non-GAAP, in line with our outlook with the inclusion of this credit. Turning to the balance sheet. Our position remained strong in the quarter and throughout the year. Cash increased each quarter reaching a record $3.73 billion at Q4, up 9% sequentially and up 19% on fiscal 2012. In Q4, we initiated quarterly cash dividends and extended our share repurchase program. We returned $147 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter, with $100 million of stock repurchased and $47 million in dividends paid. Accounts receivable at Q4 was up $9 million over the prior quarter on slightly less shipment linearity. Conversely, inventory was down $9 million from the prior quarter at $420 million. Regarding the first quarter outlook for fiscal 2014, our expectations for GAAP are as follows. Revenue is expected to be $940 million, plus or minus 2%. We expect revenue for the first quarter to be less in Q4, reflecting lower GPU sales in line with expectations for the PC industry and lower Tegra sales as customer devices based on Tegra 3 ramp down ahead of Tegra 4 production. We expect gross margin of approximately 52.9%, flat from Q4, OpEx of approximately $430 million and a tax rate of approximately 16% plus or minus 1%. We expect the same for the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from a GAAP outlook. Gross margin of approximately 53.2%, flat from Q4, and OpEx of approximately $395 million. This excludes stock-based compensation and certain charges related to acquisitions an aggregate of approximately $35 million. The increase in OpEx for Q1 over the fourth quarter is primarily due to the employee related costs, including planned hiring for our key growth businesses with the addition of a large FICA tax reset that occurs each first quarter. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million and capital expenditures of $55 million to $65 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately $619 million. Lastly, we will pay our next quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 per share in the first quarter fiscal 2014. On an annual basis, this is equivalent to $0.30 per share and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday\u2019s closing price of $12.43. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.\nOperator: (Operator instructions). And your first question does come from Betsy Van Hees Wedbush Securities.\nBetsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities: I was wondering if you could help us understand in terms of the guidance from the revenue which business segment. Is it going to be equally down as a percentage basis? Or is one going to be down more than the other in any of your reporting segments?\nKaren Burns: So as I mentioned, we expect that our GPU business will be down very much in line with the PC industry and as you know Intel, AMD and other companies have already disclosed. And then the other component will be Tegra related which will be larger and that again is the transition effect from T3 to Tegra 4.\nBetsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities: Okay. Thanks very much. And so my follow up question has to do with OpEx. So, not this pretty big jump up in the GAAP OpEx, $430 million from your $402 million and then your $384 million in the prior quarter. So as we\u2019re looking at the July and October, are we going to see OpEx sort of flattening out, or are we going to continue to have these incremental increases. And I was wondering if you could help us a little bit with the OpEx?\nKaren Burns: Sure. So as you saw last year, we had a similar jump and we have it every first quarter. And as I explained, it's really the FICA tax reset that hits us pretty hard in the first quarter. And just like in fiscal 2013, OpEx levels are up for the rest of the year. So we expect a similar type of impact this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Eliscu with UBS.\nStephen Eliscu \u2013 UBS: Last year, just more specifically you gave us full year guidance for both OpEx and the percentage growth on Tegra, which was very helpful in terms of thinking about where Nvidia was coming around in fiscal '13. Slide 12 in your presentation talks about your growth drivers. Can you give us a sense as to what Tegra will grow the OpEx number and just review some of those other growth drivers. So we have a sense as to where you will end out for the full year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Steve, first of all thank you. I think we haven\u2019t decided yet whether to guide to full year or not. At the moment we have decided to guide a quarter out. And to tell you the truth, I am not sure how helpful it will be to all of you, that we guided the whole year. And so I think at the moment we are still thinking throughout. But some of the comments that you heard related to -- in Rob's comment, were specific Tegra. As this point we have more design wins than we had at this point with Tegra 3. You also heard we are now sampling our 4G LTE modem, and this is a pretty large market. It's still early in the modem, overall model market. It's about $150 million units large projected this year. Growing about 50% per year. The overall connected device market is probably about 1 billion -- north of a 1 billion units. So there is a lot of LTE 4G modems that need to be shipped. And this is really the first year where we have the ability to engage the market. So we are really super excited about it. We are going to engage it very very hard. And we are sampling modems around the world now. And so those are good growth indicators for Tegra 4. In the first quarter, always we ramp down Tegra 3 as we ramp up Tegra 4. And hopefully in the future as we get more and more into lower end devices where the lifecycle is a little longer, this transitional effect would be less pronounced. But this is something we expected and is something that will transition into Tegra 4 as fast as we can.\nStephen Eliscu \u2013 UBS: And as far as feedback, as far as the guidance, the first time you provided it was probably a bit premature. But when you provided it a year ago for fiscal '13, it was extremely helpful. So we appreciate that. Just as a follow-up question here, we have heard about one of your primary competitors in the ARM processor talk about cleaning clocks of Tegra. Can you give us a sense as to, given some of the slippages that the trade press has reported with Tegra 4, that how -- to give us confidence that indeed you will be able to maintain performance leadership when we see Tegra 4 come out.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I guess, I won't comment on his comment. And I don\u2019t know how he could possibly know the performance of Tegra 4. No one outside the company knows the performance of Tegra 4. So that\u2019s number one. I will refrain my going any further, I would like to. But with respect to Tegra 4, I guess you're just going to have to wait just a little longer, not much longer and you will see performance evaluations of Tegra 4 and I think you\u2019ll be quite pleased with them. Tegra 4 is many times higher performance than Tegra 3 in many areas and it\u2019s designed to be very high performance. There\u2019s a lot of confidence in why we can deliver that performance leadership. We said that about Tegra 3 and I think we delivered on that. This is an area that we\u2019re quite good at. So whether it\u2019s CPU performance or GPU performance or camera performance, these are three areas that we\u2019ve made big breakthroughs on. But the two areas that are super important to our customers have to do with the battery life that we can sustain despite the fact that our performance is really high and it has to do with two very unique features. One is our four plus one energy saving core. We invented this technology and we\u2019re still the only company in the world shipping this technology and none of our competitors have this technology as of yet, although some of them are talking about it in the future. Second is a technology that\u2019s related to modulating the backlight on a per pixel per frame level. That is something that\u2019s very unique to Tegra and it saves hundreds of Miliwatts because as you can imagine how much a display backlight consumes. It\u2019s getting higher and higher because the resolutions are getting higher and the displays are getting brighter and people expect more from their display. This is a technology that is quite unique to us and with Tegra 4 we have our second generation of that. And so we\u2019ve introduced not only performance capabilities but as well as battery saving capabilities and new functionalities like our camera. And so I\u2019m looking forward to the reviewers which ultimately the reviewers will tell us how their processor compares to ours. But based on everything we know about that, I think our position of Tegra 4 is going to be pretty extraordinary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: I wonder if you could give a little more color about the Quadro business. I think in your last quarter comments you were expecting some weakness in that business and it looked like from the commentary that that grew in the quarter despite some limited quantities of the K5000. Can you talk about that a little bit and what your expectations are that for the April quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019ll let Karen talk about the April quarter, but what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll talk to you about the dynamics of that business. We\u2019re gaining share in that business because our positioning in graphics is getting stronger than ever. Our technology leadership position is pulling ahead whereas graphics is important and it continues to be. We\u2019ve introduced new ways of rendering graphics, ray tracing and other computational graphics capabilities. We\u2019ve added simulation technology made possible by GPU computing so that you can simulate and visualize at the same time. So the capabilities that we\u2019ve provided is increasing. We\u2019re just transitioning Kepler into our entire enterprise product line and Kepler as you know is just a wonderful GPU. It\u2019s the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. It\u2019s the best GPU the industry has ever built and we\u2019re in the process of transitioning that into Quadro. That\u2019s been offset. There are some offsetting dynamics related to the weakness of the enterprise market in some areas around the world. There were some delays related to the next generation workstation motherboard from Intel. But I think there are people working through all those issues and I think the dynamics will play out.\nKaren Burns: So to answer the second part of your question. So for this quarter Q4, we saw nice a strength in Quadro. Quarter-over-quarter Quadro was up about 11%. So as Jen-Hsun mentioned, we have great plans with Kepler and our market opportunities. For next quarter Q1, we are expecting relatively flat, as Jen-Hsun mentioned, again, there is some offsetting forces and we are being a little bit conservative perhaps. But we had a really strong quarter in Q4.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. Great. As a follow-up, could you help us calibrate our expectations for the PC graphics business as we go through the year? I understand you don\u2019t provide full year guidance right now but what you guy had told us in the past is that your growth in PC graphics is not necessarily mirroring what's happening in the PC market. There is gaming products cycles, your own product cycles there. Could you give us some color on that and in addition, what your expectations for market share? Particularly notebook side this year, where you have gained some market share last year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: My expectation is that we will gain market share this year, or we will continue to gain market this year. With respect to PC graphics. PC graphics has two components to it, right. And I am excluding the Tesla GPU computing product line, I am excluding the workstation product line, Quadro. The PC graphics, the consumer product line has really two components. The larger component, well there is three components. So there is the OEM graphics, where the OEMs use our GPUs to differentiate their notebooks or differentiate their PCs. They add our GPUs and because it's clearly additive, and so the performance is so much better. Now they could provide the same basic platform with a premium skew. The dynamic hasn\u2019t really changed and my guess is that an OEMs desire to create premium products will continue to be there. The larger dynamic, the larger market for PC graphics, is related to PC gaming. We have always said that PC gaming is vibrant. We have said that PC gaming is in fact growing. And the reason for that is because the PC platform is open. And it allows for a lot of innovation, not only for technology but also for business models. One of the most important new growth dynamic has to do with free to play. Free to play is really a wonderful business model. And it's a business model that doesn\u2019t serve as well a proprietary and a close platform model where it's royalty bearing. And so these free to play platforms are fabulous for PCs. And it attracts new gamers. It costs nothing to try it and unless you really enjoy the game, that\u2019s when you really get in and buy up virtual goods. Where you can differentiate your outfit, your costume, differentiate your weapons, play new levels. And so the more you enjoy the game, the more your welcome to spend in the game. And I think that that kind of business model really tailors nicely to PCs. It's also much more associated with MMOs, massively multi-player online games. And so those dynamics continue to help drive our PC graphics business, the gaming graphics business. So for the year, I think that these dynamics will remain true, that the MMO and the free to play business models are going to continue to drive and help grow the PC graphics business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Jen-Hsun, when we look at the business model and the OpEx growth, last year we grew OpEx at a rate above the revenue growth and you are able to offset it with gross margin leverage. Looking forward, if I run the numbers, it looks like we are going to see about 15% OpEx growth year on year even if you hold Q1 level pretty stable for the balance of the year. How should we think about that going forward? Should we think about revenue leverage here or is there a gross margin leverage potential to hold on to the earnings column?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Doug, appreciate the question. I think first of all we have to recognize that we\u2019re investing into a once in a lifetime and very large market opportunities. We weren\u2019t the first modem company in the world, but we need a modem, a 4G LTE modem to address the very large LTE connected devices market and if we\u2019re able to deliver that, we\u2019re in a pretty special place. And the reason for that is because we have a great application processor. We have a great application processor roadmap because we have the technology and capability to sustain it. One of the most important capabilities in the mobile market is the ability to have software. There are so many different operating systems and Microsoft does a great deal in the PC industry that\u2019s not afforded to in the rest of the embedded markets. And this is a market where in the connected device marketplace where there is Android and Chrome and WinRT and Linux and QNX and all these different operating systems require a world class system software team. And so if we have those two things and we combine it with LTE which we\u2019re now sampling. The combination of these three things could put us in a very special place. So we want to go after that large and fast growing LTE marketplace and the investments necessary. So the answer to your question is revenue leverage. We\u2019re looking forward to revenue leverage. Now, our GPU business of course is still growing as well and there\u2019s opportunities to grow there. The last year we grew 8% if you excluded the chipset business that we exited and this year we added a new type of GPU product. We incorporated our GPUs into a first of its kind graphics appliance. It\u2019s a graphics computing system. It\u2019s dedicated to doing graphics and we described a few applications for the Nvidia GRID and I think that this type of computing appliance, this graphics appliance is \u2013 for a GPU is very similar to a router as a router is for networking chips or a network attached storage is for starter chip. At some point, when you want to share these resources with a larger workgroup or with a lot of different people, these graphics appliances, these computing appliances are really a perfect fit and we see a lot of people wanting to go to SAS, but they can\u2019t do it with graphics intensive applications. And now with the Nvidia Grid, they can finally do that. So I\u2019m excited about the GPU growth opportunities still, but one of the areas where we\u2019re investing very heavily and that\u2019s the reason why you saw the investments from the last couple of years is really to put us in a place where we can engage the LTE market and this year we will aggressively do that.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: And just as my follow up. I have a good understanding of where the growth is going to come from on the Tegra 4. Clearly it sounds like with the LTE modem you want to grow in the handset side of the market to take advantage of that. When you look at all the other investments that you\u2019re making as you just ran through a pretty healthy list there of new products that you\u2019ve introduced recently, what\u2019s number two and three on the list as far as revenue contribution?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I really listed two just now. I listed LTE and that\u2019s \u2013 when I say LTE I mean Tegra LTE. You have to invest in Tegra and you have to invest in LTE in order to engage that LTE connected device market. There is no standalone modem business anymore and in many of these new 4G connected device marketplace, an integrated approach is necessary and that\u2019s the reason why we bought Icera and that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re investing in LTE. So that\u2019s really one investment. You have to do it all together or you don\u2019t do it at all. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why all of the standalone modem companies really have gotten out and that\u2019s the reason why most of the standalone application processor companies have gone now. Because unless you have the combination of these three things, something like a Tegra application processor or a 4G modem and a software stack, you really can't play, you can't play the big games.  And I think we are rather uniquely positioned to be a great challenger here and the number two is GRID. That particular investment is really about taking our GPU and taking it out of the box. If you take the GPU out of the box, then you can grow independent of the box. And the GRID is going to make it possible for us to put our GPUs, if you will, on a network and whether it's a Mac network or a PC network, or an Android network, or whatever devices you have got networked on to it. So those were two investments that I have described and both have exciting growth opportunities ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital.\nBlayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital: [Inaudible]\nJen-Hsun Huang: I am sorry, that was really difficult for us to understand. Could you try to say that again if you are calling in on a landline? Just try that one more time.\nBlayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital: I am travelling. I was wondering if you could provide some color as to (inaudible) of what you see tablet (inaudible) a bigger driver for you as well as (inaudible)?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. I am going take a swing at that. I think you asked what is likely to be a larger growth driver for us. Is it tablets or phones and number two, is it Android or Win RT. And so that\u2019s a good question and let me see if I can try to dissect that. First of all, you know on a yearly basis, although the quarters have been a little choppy, on an annual basis most of our growth, not all of our growth but the vast majority of our growth has come from tablets. Whereas people were rather skeptical about Android tablets, we really stuck with it. And we stuck with it because we believed not in whether a tablet, an Android tablet is going to be used or not, were successful or not, we believed in the Google Cloud. We believed that people will buy books and music and games and movies and store their photographs up in the cloud. And when you put all your personal content in the cloud, you want to enjoy it on your phone, you want to enjoy when you are home in a larger format. And in which case an Android Tablet. We also believe that you would want to enjoy playing the games with a device that's designed dedicated to play games and that\u2019s the reason why built Shield. And so I think the tablet market has turned out to exceed most people's expectations. And we grew a lot in Android tablets this last year and my expectation is that there will be more Android tablets build this next year. And so the first thing is, yes, I believe in tablet. I believe in tablets wholeheartedly and it's an area, it's a segment of the marketplace that we are going to continue to invest and be quite successful in.  WinRT, I believe it is essential. Strategically essential for Microsoft to be on all of the major processor in the world. Surely the highest volume processor in the world. As a software company and an operating system company it's a market they can't afford to ignore. And so Win RT is surely going to be an important area for them. Now whether people see Win RT as a consumer tablet or as a PC is yet to be determined. But at the very minimum, if you are extrapolated forward by a few years, it's hard to imagine how Win RT can possibly, won't possibly be a wonderful PC. We know exactly what it feels like on top of the Tegra 4 and it rocks, it's fantastic. And so WinRT, I think will be successful as well. Microsoft will have no choice but to continue to invest in it and it\u2019s a great company.  They\u2019ll do something great with it with respect to tab. So that\u2019s Android and WinRT. I already commented on tablets, smartphones, super phones. This is an area that we will likely need to have an LTE modem in order to be successful and that\u2019s the reason why we work so hard to accelerate our LTE modem to market. We\u2019re working around the clock and this is \u2013 with an LTE modem, the Tegra processor and our software capability, we will be able to address a much larger phone opportunity going forward. And so we\u2019ll have some phone success this year, but we\u2019re not expecting to have a whole lot of phone design wins until we engage the market with LTE.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: A question. I wonder if you could give us more of a timeline on the GRID development and when we could see significant revenue for that product. What are some of the obstacles in front of you still?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks a lot, Kevin. I think GRID the architecture comes in three flavors. One and the one that we developed first is GRID for enterprise VDI. We\u2019ve been working with Citrix, VMWare and Microsoft for quite a long time and that particular application by installing our graphics card, the GRID VGX graphics cards into a industry standard OEM server, you could deploy it in enterprises and accelerate the VDI installations that you have. And so if you had a Citrix desktop it would just be much snappier. We could also address markets where the current VDI solutions aren\u2019t sufficiently good enough because the graphics performance isn\u2019t good enough, it doesn\u2019t run certain applications like workstations. So we could expand the market for VDI. Our three partnerships are going fabulously. Everybody is very excited about that and that is likely the first area of growth this year for GRID. The second component of growth has to do with Cloud gaming. We have about six partners and we\u2019re evaluating new ones who are middleware partners who service TELCOs and MSOs around the world to provide Cloud gaming to these TELCOs and MSOs. They would like to provide gaming as one of the channels of cable television. And so it\u2019s another way for them to monetize a subscriber base they already have. It\u2019s another way for TELCOs to provide content that could be enjoyed over the LTE networks. And so you could imagine that this is creating new content, adding content inventory to their subscriber bases, something that of course every TELCO and every MSO would more than love to do. And so we have six partners partnering with us around the world. The trials are going on at 12 TELCOs around the world and there are more coming online as we speak. So that evaluation will take longer because the quality of service has to be proven and these large networks have to be tested. And so that\u2019s the second that we\u2019ve started. I\u2019m not expecting large revenue contribution this year, but it\u2019s really, really important that we do proof of concepts and trials at every TELCO this year. And so that\u2019s our primary focus. And the third has to do with SAS. As you know, most of the software companies would like to move to a SAS model, from whether it\u2019s monetization or just being able to access new customers more quickly, not having to install a heavyweight application in somebody\u2019s network is one of the fastest ways to capture new subscribers or new customers, new licensees.  And so being able to just literally put a heavyweight application like an Adobe or AutoDesk or SolidWorks application, workstation application, there\u2019s a little icon that you double click and boom, you\u2019re in that application because the application is being served on a network. It's a real benefit to them. And so this is a new market as well for us. Obviously created the first of its kind of device. It's a graphics, it's a GPU. It's a massive collection of GPUs in a computing device. And so we are very good at GPUs of course and all the software is in-house. But we are re-cultivating that marketplace and we will see how it goes. And so I wish I had crisp answers on these -- on GRID. But this is a first of its kind device and we have enthusiastic partners. Because it provides a benefit to all those in the ecosystem and as soon as we can, we will report on the actual business component of it.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks for those details. Have you seen any competition or any other alternative solutions for this type of application?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, GRID is first of its kind and my expectation is that it will be the only one of its kind for a while. And the reason for that is because in order to crate GRID, we have to create a new architecture for a GPU, create a new system architecture. Create a new system software architecture to virtualize, to share, to connect, to remotely render on to devices of all kinds. And so this is -- we own the entire stack and so it's easy for us to do it. I don\u2019t really know how other people, somebody else would independently cut across that many layers of the architecture and system, and systems software to achieve it. But at the moment everything I know and what I see in the horizon, GRID is really the only one in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: I was wondering if you could help me understand the gross margins. You did a very job keeping them stable in a down revenue environment but it seems like you had a pretty healthy mix up in high margin areas like workstations. And even going into Q1, where you are expecting flattish gross margins, again it sounds like workstations again will be kind of flattish or you will see declines elsewhere. Are you seeing gross margin decline elsewhere or maybe price declines, just help me understand that. Thank you.\nKaren Burns: I\u2019m sorry. I missed the first part of your question. Can you just -- the first part please?\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: I am trying to figure out the flat gross margins, where you have what seems like a positive mix effect happening underneath your revenues to workstation.\nKaren Burns: For this quarter, or next?\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: For both Q4 as well as your guidance for Q1.\nKaren Burns: Okay. So the mix is quite -- as I explained in the commentary, it's really stable. Yes, Quadro was up but there is always some offset. Quadro was up in Q4 but probably one of the larger areas is the memory. When memory moves around, that can basically drive our margins a bit. But overall the blend is pretty stable and that\u2019s just how it is. The next quarter we are expecting about the same.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: Okay. As it relates to the desktop segment, you had pretty good share gains this year. Can you talk about what some of the dynamics are on the channel currently? As far as like how inventories are looking and maybe what your expectations are in terms of market share for the full year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, inventory levels turn out to be slightly up when the revenues are down are you could imagine. And so we are expecting next quarter, this coming quarter to be seasonal as well as consistent with the overall PC market. And so inventory will likely be slightly -- will be up a tad. But we watch it very, very closely. You know the channel is very important to us and all the partners and the flow through is important to us. And in a way to control and manage your gross margins, it's vital. It's vital not to have too much inventory, as you know. And so that we watched that like a hawk and that\u2019s one of the reasons why our gross margins and well managed as improving. As far as the year goes, our position in graphics is as good as it's ever been and my expectation is that our position in graphics will improve this year. Shield will help GeForce. The ability to stream remotely your PC game and to be able to enjoy it on your Shield is quite a magical new experience and the enthusiasm from our GeForce customers around the world is really quite spectacular. We\u2019ve had more press written about Shield than just about anything in the history of our company. And so I think the enthusiasm is quite high and Shield is intended to be \u2013 one of its intentions is to be a companion device for GeForce. And so that\u2019s going to enhance our GeForce position. So throughout the year my expectations are our position will continue to improve. But with respect to market share we\u2019ll just have to report that when we get there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: I was wondering if you look at your pipeline in Tegra 4 (inaudible) throughout the year, should we expect any kind of meaningful increase in Tegra as we head into the July quarter? Is this going to be more back half loaded in Q3 and Q4?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s impossible to hear you at all.\nJim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: I\u2019m just wondering, in terms of the design win ramp you see for Tegra 4 this year, do you think that will be an increase in any, like the July quarter or do you expect that all to come in the back half of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We ship Tegra 4 starting in Q2. We\u2019re ramping production now and we have full production release. And so we\u2019re ramping production. Q2 is when we ship to customers. Q2 is also when we ship the Tegra 4 based Shield device. And so we also start shipping in Q2. Although it\u2019s in the latter part of Q2, it\u2019s going to be in Q2.\nJim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Follow up. When we look at your R&D spending throughout the year when you talked about modest decreases as we head into the end of the year, could you talk about any new initiatives, whether that\u2019s for GRID, for shield or (inaudible) that will provide that increase as we head through the year?\nRob Csongor: Jim, this is Rob. Did you ask are there any new initiatives on OpEx other than GRID? Is that what you asked?\nJim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Is there any cause for the repeat through the year? Yes.\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are three things that are new businesses if you will, not new businesses but additions to our businesses this year. The first addition is LTE modems. LTE modems by itself is not a new business, but LTE modem will allow Tegra to enter into new markets where LTE is necessary. We already have many LTE design wins on i500 and our expectation is this is going to be quite a good trend for us. So that\u2019s one additional part of our business. The second additional part of our business is using our own Tegra processor and utilizing our own proprietary technologies and software and such to build an Android device. We call that Shield. The third addition to our business is GRID which is a GPU. It\u2019s a network attached GPU. It\u2019s not a new business. It\u2019s a GPU business. It\u2019s packed with GPUs and it serves our existing marketplace partnered with our existing partners. It\u2019s sold into the same ecosystems. And so we have three things this year. Tegra LTE, number one. Number two, Shield; and number three is our GRID graphics appliance. Hey, Jim, I hope we answered your question. We will follow up with you and make sure we got that. I think we have time for one more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners: Just a few questions. First off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about your design traction on your modem business. So you talked about i500, the Icera acquisition is definitely a key part of that. Just curious as you know, if you could help us maybe understand maybe the shape of the growth this year in perhaps deciding, is it something that\u2019s grows to 100 million this year, is it something that is a lot bigger than that. I mean 150 million for the year, it's a big [tam]. So just wanted to think about that right away.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, let's see. The first thing is, it's important to note that the previous generation of our LTE modem, the i410, is the first and currently still the only Win RT LTE modem certified by AT&T. It is currently shipping in the Asus Vivo tablet. And if you get a chance to try this, it's really wonderful. It stands to reason that there are many other Win RT Tegra 4 tablets in development. And we would transition them to the i500 modem. We don\u2019t sell the modem separately. It's sold as a kit. It's sold with Tegra 4. And so it's hard to break it out per say. But more and more of our business will include LTE because we had no LTE penetration in the past and this year we are going to be shipping LTE modem. So I don\u2019t exactly how much -- we are trying to make it as much possible. But at this point we are not guiding the whole year.\nPatrick Wang - Evercore Partners: And then just for my follow up. I was curious, when we take a look at the full year, you have got a lot of great stuff happening on Tegra outside of just handsets. So you have got tablet traction, you have got Shield, you have got automotive that did well last quarter. When we look at it full year here, I mean you guys did a great job hitting 50% growth last year. Could you care to maybe give us some help in terms of ballpark, how much growth we should be thinking about in this year in fiscal '14, given the transition and the fact that we are kind of starting off a little bit light as we enter the April quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the way we enter the April quarter is I guess similar during every transition and I am hoping that overtime as our -- although we have had this transition now for all three generations, each one of the transition, the peaks have become much higher. And the revenue at the whole business has much become much larger. And so our position in the market place is growing. Our footprint is growing and our position is more strategic to the marketplace than ever. But we haven\u2019t decided to guide the whole year. We are going to go through this transition one more time and we will start shipping in Q2. But we haven\u2019t decided to guide for the full year. What you recognize are the same things we observe as well. Whereas before we really only had Android tablets, now we have a much larger Android tablet market. We have Win RT PCs, we have Shield, and we have automotive. And so Tegra is not just the smartphone and of course we have Tegra LT which will be great for connected tablets as well as smartphones. And so we have more than just Android application processors now. We have much more than that, but it's hard to say exactly how much for the year and we are just going to go do as best we can. Okay. I think that will do it for today. We are going to have to wrap it up. Thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter at our Q1 results. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call.

All our statements are made as of today, November 8, 2012, based on information available to us as of today and, except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. Unless otherwise noted, all reference to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website. With that, let's begin. We are pleased to report that NVIDIA achieved record revenue and record gross margin in the third quarter, driven by strong demand for our energy-efficient Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3, the world's only 4-PLUS-1 mobile quad-core processor. Our strategies to reinvent our company are driving growth. They are: first, create the most energy-efficient processors; second, invent mobile and cloud-computing technologies that will grow us beyond the PC; and third, create solutions for special-purpose PC markets, where we can make a significant contribution such as gaming, design, media and entertainment and GPU-accelerated computing. This quarter, we not only grew our PC business. We also significantly increased our business beyond the PC: in tablets, quad-core phones, data centers and automobiles. NVIDIA processors rolled out in Q3 in a range of new devices and settings, from Google's Nexus 7 tablet and Microsoft's Surface to Oak Ridge National Laboratory's new supercomputer and Tesla's latest electric sedan, which was just named Car of the Year by Automobile Magazine. 3 years ago, non-PC revenues were 7% of total revenues. This quarter, they grew to a record 30%. Our notebook GPU business recorded a second consecutive record quarter. In the premium segment, we increased market share with Kepler as part of the Ivy Bridge design cycle. Consumers are also now starting to realize that a great tablet is better than a cheap PC. Because of Tegra, Android and Windows RT, the entry-level PC market is now a new opportunity for us. Our desktop GPU business increased again this quarter. With improved supply now available, we delivered Kepler into the volume PC gaming market. With the majority of gamers using graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out, Kepler is a great upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world looking to play Assassin's Creed III, Far Cry 3 or Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 this Christmas holiday. Our Professional Solutions business was up, driven by a record quarter for Tesla. In Q3, we shipped more than 18,000 NVIDIA Tesla K20 GPU accelerators to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for their new Titan supercomputer. With 50 million CUDA cores working together, these new Kepler-based GPUs delivered 90% of Titan's 20 petaflops of peak processing performance, making Titan the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world. While the Quadro business was roughly flat quarter-to-quarter, it was down from last year, consistent with softness in the global workstation market. Our strategies to grow better than the market include new Kelper Quadro products to refresh Romley-based workstations in the latter part of the year, as well as new capabilities like Maximus, enabling both modeling and simulation in one workstation. In addition, this quarter, we also announced the industry's first cloud-based GPU that delivers workstation graphics capabilities to any screen. Built on the Kepler architecture, the cloud-based NVIDIA VGX K2 GPU will allow engineers and design professionals to work anywhere on virtually any device and still have access to the computing and graphics performance of a GPU-powered workstation. Tegra had another record quarter, driven primarily by the emergence of Tegra 3 as the applications processor of choice for many of the world's most popular tablet. According to Strategy Analytics data, market share for Android tablets grew in Q3 to 41% from Q2's 29%. Tegra 3 is now powering a number of Android tablets, including the highly successful $199 Google Nexus 7. It also began powering Windows PCs with the launch of Windows RT devices. These include Microsoft's revolutionary Surface, Lenovo's IdeaPad Yoga 11 and the ASUS Vivo Tab. Additionally, new Tegra 3 smartphones were released in important markets. Of note, AT&T announced that they will be launching the new HTC One X+, the first Tegra 3 LTE phone to ship in the U.S. market. And ZTE announced the U950 quad-core smartphone, which delivers Tegra 3 to a new price segment for the China smartphone market. This segment is about 30 million to 40 million units large. NVIDIA's automotive business also delivered a record quarter and continued its steady growth, as a growing number of leading auto brands choose Tegra to drive their infotainment and navigation systems. With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. We had record revenue this quarter of $1.2 billion, up 15.3% quarter-over-quarter and 12.9% year-over-year. As in the second quarter, revenue was driven by strong demand for our Kepler GPUs in desktops and record performances by our notebook and Tegra products. We also achieved record gross margin on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, up 1.1 percentage points sequentially and up 0.7 point year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 53.1%, up 1.1 points sequentially and up 0.6 point from a year earlier. These record margins reflect the continued transition to Kepler GPUs from our previous Fermi generation and a mix more weighted to high-end segments. GAAP OpEx was $384.4 million, and non-GAAP was $344.8 million, both better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of a non-recurring charge of $20.1 million in Q2 related to our announced charitable contribution. Non-GAAP OpEx, which excluded this charge, was up slightly from the prior quarter, driven by planned strategic hiring and higher engineering-related costs, offset by lower compensation costs, including FICA, and reductions in discretionary expenses. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $209.1 million, a 75.6% increase over the prior quarter and 17.3% year-over-year. That's equivalent to $0.33 per diluted share, which was up 73.7% sequentially and 13.8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $245.5 million, up 44% sequentially and 13.1% year-over-year. That's $0.39 per diluted share, which was a 44.4% increase sequentially and 11.4% year-over-year. Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 10.7% sequentially and 14.7% year-over-year. This was due to the continued launch of our new Kepler desktop products and our OEM partners launching new Ivy Bridge platform for notebook. Our Professional business was up 12.4% sequentially due to the first shipments of our new Kepler-based Tesla products, supporting the new Titan supercomputer. Year-over-year, our Professional business was down 4.2%. The strength in Tesla year-over-year was partially offset by the weak economic conditions impacting demand for our Quadro products. Our Consumer business was up 35.7% sequentially and 27.6% year-over-year on the strength of our Tegra business. Inventory in our desktop channel business remains stable at levels we believe are healthy. DSO was 34 days, down 5 days from the prior quarter. Accounts receivable and DSO decreased in the current quarter despite the increase in revenue as a result of shipment linearity and strong collections. DSI was 69 days, down 1 day from the prior quarter. We increased inventory by $41.8 million from the prior quarter, largely for production builds of our Kepler GPU products in support of expected demand, offset by declines in our Fermi-based GPUs. Our GAAP outlook for the fourth quarter is as follows: revenue of $1.025 billion to $1.175 billion; gross margin of 52.9%, flat from third quarter; OpEx of approximately $400 million; and a tax rate of 20%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 53.1%, flat from Q3; and OpEx of approximately $359 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in the aggregate of approximately $41 million. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 19%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million and capital expenditures of $60 million to $70 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 629 million. Lastly, we are very pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and has also approved the extension of our existing share repurchase program to December 31, 2014. The quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share is equivalent to $0.30 per share on an annual basis and approximates an annual yield of about 2.4% based on yesterday's closing stock price of $12.61. We have increased our cash by $305.2 million this fiscal year, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the current quarter of $3.43 billion compared to $3.13 billion at Q4 fiscal 2012. We are committed to return cash to our shareholders and made this decision based on our strong cash position and the high confidence we have in our business to continue generating future cash. Thanks, Rob.\nRob Csongor: That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: And your first question does come from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could speak to underlying fundamentals right now on the PC business. I know that you're taking share, but to the extent that you can maybe address how you see seasonality extending into Q1, and I was wondering if you could also speak to that same effect in your enterprise business.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the P -- you're right that we're gaining share, our fundamentals are better than ever. Our GPU position is better than ever whether it's GeForce or Quadro for workstations or Tesla for high-performance computing. We're increasing share. Our position is better than ever, and -- but the end market is uncertain. The PC end market is uncertain as you've seen in other businesses. And so we're going to take a rather cautious approach to our outlook.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I'm wondering if maybe you can address with your modestly down sequential outlook, where do you think you're baking in the most conservatism and where could be the greatest opportunity for upside surprise?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, if you look at year-over-year -- look at this quarter year-over-year, the business that had underperformed all the other business was our Quadro business. And that's related to enterprise weakness, but it's also associated with the fact that Romley, the server platform, was delayed by some time for workstations. It's in the process of ramping now. And we think that, that held back some purchases of new workstations as people waited for this new platform. It's surely a lot better than the previous generation. And so, hopefully, as Romley gets out into the marketplace with the new Kepler GPUs, we're going to see the workstation market recover. But the end markets, whether it's notebooks or desktop, our expectation and our outlook is that it's softer than we had originally predicted.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, just curious from your perspective, what's contributing to the uncertainty in the PC market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're not seeing anything unusual than anybody else. The end markets are softer than this time last year. If -- I guess, I'm surprised that you asked at all, although I think the overall market seems to indicate that the holiday season for PC sales is a little softer than expected. And it's global. It's not particularly related to one particular geography. But China is softer. Europe is softer. The U.S. is -- seems okay. But the vast majority of the end markets appear to be uncertain.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: The reason I asked the question is, from Intel's perspective, they've highlighted the macro, as well as the fact that some of these other devices like tablets are eating into the PC TAM. But curious from your perspective, if you see one issue being a bigger issue -- a bigger problem than the other.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our view of the PC TAM is that it is being eaten by tablets. And the reason for that is because a great tablet is surely better than a cheap PC. And these days, the tablets are so versatile. And many of them are transformable and have hybrid tablet, as well as notebook usage models. And now with the Surface -- Microsoft Surface and Win RT, the distinction between a PC -- a cheap PC and a great tablet is all but disappeared. And in fact, we see our tablet business grew 100% year-over-year. And so I think that the PC market, especially the cheap PC market -- but we don't really play in the cheap PC market. The low-end part of the cheap PC market is all integrated. And so our opportunity is to replace and going into that marketplace with the Tegra processors and the tablets that we serve. So for us, the vast majority of uncertainty is just end market of PC.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And just as a follow-up, I was hoping you could give us a sense of how aggressive you plan to be with the buyback over the next 2 years.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We haven't decided. I assume that you're pleased with the dividend, and we're surely pleased by that. And our Board of Directors has extended our stock buyback plan to 2014, as Karen had said. And so we'll evaluate it from time to time, and we'll be in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: First, quick administrative one. You're guiding for GAAP operating expenses to rise sequentially in the January quarter even though your revenues are coming down. So is there a big jump in R&D? And where does that come from?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our big jump in R&D comes from really 2 places. One, we're in the process of going to market with our next-generation mobile processor. And that's a -- we're really excited about that next-generation processor, and we're ramping very hard. The second part is our 4G LTE modem. In order for us to really gain a larger footprint in smartphones, we have to integrate 4G LTE modem into our application processor. This is a brand-new market for us. Although we are already shipping some quantities of discrete LTE modems, the vast majority of the marketplace is really integrated. And so our -- we have a next-generation application processor integrated with a next-generation LTE. And this quarter, we hope to tape out and race it to market. And so our OpEx has increased so that we can invest in that initiative. It's obviously a very, very large market opportunity for us, and so we're very quite bullish about it.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And actually, related to that, can you give us some feel for what proportion of Tegra are tablets rather than smartphones? And do you expect Tegra for Windows RT tablets to be up or down in the January quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We expect -- I'll go backwards. We expect the tablet sales to be down in the January quarter because most of the tablets go into -- we shipped most of the tablet processors into manufacturing for our OEMs for their holiday build. Overall, our tablets are up 100% year-over-year. Our Tegra processors overall is up about 50% year-over-year. And so that gives you a sense that the vast majority of the Tegra growth has come from tablets, and Super Phones has been relatively stable. And one of the reasons why we are so interested in integrating our application processor with a 4G modem, so that we can expand the reach of our application processors into Super -- into more of the smartphone marketplace. This is really a great opportunity for us. Because if you think about the number of companies in the world that can combine a world-class CPU, a world-class GPU, a 4G modem and has the expertise and the complicated software stacks necessary to partner with all of the companies on the various computing devices, there aren't really that many companies. And this is a great opportunity for us, and so we're investing aggressively to get 4G into our product line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe to start off, can you just give us more color directionally what your 3 segments are going to be trending in the fourth quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see, I think the -- we're expecting our overall business to be down. And there are really 2 drivers of that, that the -- we're being cautious about the PC end markets. The entire -- we're seeing relatively similar behavior across each one of the regions. Although our position is better than ever in GPUs and in our workstation business, the PSP business, as well as our Consumer business where the Tegra business is, we're expecting some amount of end market softness. The second thing I've just -- I explained to David that the tablet will be down, even though the devices that we're in are incredibly successful. The Nexus 7 is selling super well. And the Surface and the Win RT devices are really exciting. And, however, the vast majority of the builds for the holidays have to happen for the holidays. And so we shipped more proportionally to them in Q3 than in Q4. But overall, year-over-year, the tablet has doubled. And the overall Tegra business has increased 50%. And so I think that we'll see how the market -- the end markets do. And nobody's going to know until it's done. So but if it does well, we're really well positioned to take advantage of it.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then on the desktop GPU side, it looks like you had solid growth there in the third quarter. And I know that a big percentage of this business is tied to gaming. In the U.S., we've seen several new and much-anticipated game releases. I could clearly see that as a big demand driver for the team. But the team has often talked about the gaming environment in Asia as being an even bigger driver for your GeForce products. So maybe you can just spend a little bit of time, kind of highlighting what are some of that trends in Asia that are responsible for -- what were responsible for kind of the solid demand trends for your Kepler-based products in the second half of this year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. In fact, our GeForce business has been growing steadily, and it remains robust. The driver for that, of course, is PC gaming. The gaming marketplace is very, very large. And each one of the regions has a slightly different dynamic. Here in the West, we're going to see a couple of really huge titles coming out. Call of Duty is coming out this holiday season, Far Cry is coming out, and Assassin's Creed is coming out. And the anticipation is really great for those. In China, the dynamics are rather different completely. On the one hand, there are no game consoles really in China, so the PC is the game console of China. And the second dynamic is their discovery of free-to-play, massive online, multiplayer online games that are free to play. And that people can enjoy with easy access and play it and pay as they go. All they need to have is a great GeForce card, and they can enjoy just about all the games they can play. And so I think the global PC gaming marketplace is quite vibrant. And we'll just take a cautious look as we -- cautious posture going into Q4, as we're uncertain about the end markets. But if the end markets prove to be healthy and prove to be good, we're well positioned to take advantage of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nBrian C. Peterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: This is Brian Peterson in for Hans. Could you talk about 28-nanometer supply, if that was a limitation at all this quarter, and what impact that may have on your January quarter outlook?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the 28-nanometer yield and 28-nanometer supply situation have both improved substantially. And so we feel pretty good about the balance of supply and demand at the moment.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Looking at -- just backing into the number for Tegra for fiscal Q3, I come to about $165 million. Is that the ballpark for Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Roughly.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then looking at the $30 million, call it, order backing into that, that you got from Oak Ridge, is that a onetime item? Or is that expected to continue into F Q4, onetime order, as you say?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, supercomputers are built once -- one at a time. But there are other supercomputers that are going to be built around the world, if that's what you mean. Kepler is just ramping for supercomputing, for high-performance computing. And so Oak Ridge and the Titan was the first supercomputer we built into. And we've been planning on this for over a year. And so that was a very significant challenge for us. And it says something, that the world's largest supercomputer would have chosen the Kepler GPU to power 90% of its computation. And we're hoping that Titan is going to deliver some amazing breakthroughs in science. This is the largest open-science supercomputer in the world. This is the fastest open-science supercomputer in the world. And it also -- it was also the first supercomputer that we delivered Kepler to. At this point, we have supercomputers all over the world that we need to go build out. The run rate for Kepler is about 2x the run rate of Fermi 1 year ago. And so this is -- it really shows that people understand now that GPU-accelerated supercomputing, or GPU-accelerated high-performance computing is really the most energy-efficient and also dollar-efficient way of computation. And so I think we're starting to see that we're about reaching the tipping point of accelerated computing here. And we're really excited about it. It's been quite a journey and quite an investment. But now CUDA is impacting every aspect of our business. In Tesla, you could see the progress there we just talked about. CUDA is also making it possible for workstations and design applications to design and simulate at the same time. CUDA is also making it possible for our PC gaming GeForce to be able to use simulation for special effects and to materials and dynamics in the virtual world. And so CUDA is -- has proven to be a real lift for our entire GPU business. And I would go so far as to say that, because of CUDA, we have kept the GPU continuing to grow into more and more applications, and as a result, continue to grow the business.\nKaren Burns: I just want to be clear. Just on your first question, just a clarification. As we disclosed in the CFO commentary, the CPB increase quarter-over-quarter, that's almost entirely Tegra. So I think your number was understated.\nMichael McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, Jen-Hsun, just one longer-term question on Tegra. A few of us attended ARM's Tech Conference last week. And there was a session with Samsung. And they were pretty straightforward that with Exynos, they're going to be looking at more of a merchant strategy going forward. And they also expressed some pretty strong interest in Windows RT. As you look at the competitive landscape next year for Tegra, and just the resources that Samsung has, their own fabrication facilities, does that alter your view of the competitive landscape at all, when you kind of think about Samsung potentially getting involved in this business segment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Samsung is surely a formidable company. And to most customers, Samsung is just downright scary. And you've heard Asia's posture about Samsung. And so I think that our focus is pretty simple. We have to continue to stay ahead of them technologically, and we have the capability to do so. We're one of the few companies in the world that has the ability to do so in the area of computing. Number two, we are a neutral and a friendly partner for all of the companies that Samsung competes against. And in most of these devices that you're talking about, it's not a -- it's not like selling a DRAM. It's about -- it's like collaborating to build computers. And so it's engineers working hand-in-hand with other engineers. And so if there's concern about trade secrets, if there's concerns about confidentiality, we are one that they have no concerns about. And so we're not going to win everywhere. But as you know, Tegra is a small business. This is -- we still have an opportunity to grow well over 50% each year. And surely, as we look into next year, between our next-generation processor, the new segments that we're in and the fact that we're going to introduce our own 4G-integrated modem processors, I think our growth opportunity is still pretty exciting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets.\nDaniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions here. First of all, just from a housekeeping perspective, on the tax rate here, how should we be looking at the tax rate into next year? And then I have one follow-up.\nKaren Burns: The tax rate is as we disclosed, as far as our best outlook next year, who knows? I mean, we just got the elections done and we'll see what Congress does and what the our new President will be able to drive.\nDaniel L. Amir - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then kind of to follow up a bit to the previous question, I mean, where do we stand kind of in Project Denver? I mean, what's kind of the latest there? What's your thought a bit about how the ARM market will develop and kind of NVIDIA's position there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Project Denver is a 64-bit processor. And it's a full-custom v8 64-bit processor with some exciting secret sauce. And we haven't revealed much about it. There are no 64 bits processors shipping today, as you know. And v8 was just announced. The next 64-bit was just announced. And so, I guess, the only thing I could tell you is Denver is going great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That was a good response. At least, you gave your perspective to Mike's question, but I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit. The analogy between the tablet market and the PC market, it -- correct me if I'm wrong, in the PC market, you had refreshes and -- between you and AMD. And you would, on the back of your architecture, you would win a socket and lose a socket. And that could last 1.5 year, but when I look at the tablet market, so you got a marquee design win, Google 7, Nexus 7 and then the 10 goes back to Samsung. Is there anything different here that you can drive that can lead to more sustainability of design wins, and not just Google, just kind of broadly? And again, I wanted to just put that out there that you guys have done a good job and not sitting idly and targeting, going after the mobile space and expanding your TAM. And then my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, if I may, the low-end TAM you mentioned, how big is that TAM for you on the low-end PC side that you did not address before?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I could tell you what our focus is. Our focus is to build the world's best mobile computers. And to do that, you need to have a great SoC, you need to have a great GPU, and you need to have extraordinary software capability. And there are multiple platforms: there's Android, there's Android phones, there's Win RT, there's Linux, there's Chrome, there's Windows 8 phone, there's quite a few platforms. And we have the capacity as a company, both technologically as well as resources, to be able to partner with many of these companies, these ecosystem owners, to build these great computers. And you're right, we're not going to win them all. But as you can see, we win our fair share. And we're winning more and more every day. We won about 100% more this year than we did last year. And my hope is that we'll win even more next year. And every time we expand the reach of our company into new platforms, and this year was Win RT, it really expanded the reach of our company and expanded our growth. And so we're just going to keep -- stay focused on that. And one of the attributes of our company is technology leadership. You can trust us, to partner deeply with us, to build these complicated devices. And I think that's a real virtue. With respect to the size of the PC TAM you're alluding to, and what I also believe and now what the world has seen, that a great tablet is every bit better than a cheap PC. And that is the reason why tablets are gaining the favoritism of consumers all over the world. It's easier to use, it's more delightful to use, and it's more useful. And the cheap PC market represents probably a couple of hundred to 200 million units a year. The vast majority of the world's PCs are affordable PCs, as you know. They're cheap PCs. And that segment is now wide open, as these mobile processors have become more and more capable. And you know that disruption comes from the bottom. The disruption comes from the bottom because the volumes are so high. In just 2 years' time, this year, we'll probably ship around 30 million Tegra processors. And that just happened in the blink of an eye. And that's -- and yet there's enormous markets ahead of it. And so once an instruction-set architecture like the ARM CPU reaches critical mass and the developers all focus on it, it becomes more and more valuable. And it becomes more useful. And as more companies drive and compete in this ecosystem, in this marketplace, we make the SoCs better and better. And before you know it, it disrupts the market above. And the market above is -- directly above the tablet is the cheap PC market. And so that's a big opportunity for us, especially now with Win RT. And so I'm super excited about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris & Company.\nUnknown Analyst: This is Brett Perry [ph] here for Craig. Obviously, within Tegra, you're doing well in tablets. Can you talk a little bit about the smartphone mix you have in there and design wins maybe that you have compared to -- I think you've referenced 30 before?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We -- this year, for Super Phones, we did about as well this year as we did last year. Last year, we had Motorola, we had LG, we had some others. This year, we had the benefit of working with HTC; Fujitsu, the #1 in Japan; ZTE; and with Wayne, our next-generation processor, we will have even more. And so each year, we're able to gain the trust and develop the reputation to work with more and more smartphone companies. And so we're going to continue to expand in that segment. It -- for us to really grow in the smartphone marketplace, as you know, we need to really integrate a modem. And that's one of the reasons why we -- well, that's the reason why we bought this really great company called Icera. And we have 4G LTE now certified at AT&T data side. And we're in the process of working on voice. Now one of the reasons why our OpEx is high -- increased for next quarter is our increased investment in our integrated application processor in 4G from product. And so if we can get that to market soon, and which we hope, we'll be able to expand our smartphone opportunity quite dramatically. And now that we have the software stack developed with each one of the phone companies, the opportunity could be quite significant for us.\nUnknown Analyst: And then on the GPU side, could you talk about the trends you're seeing? But then, obviously, I think ASP should probably be up within the GPU. By how much that was up compared to units in the quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Maybe Karen could tell you the exact numbers. But overall, the -- with the exception of Quadro, which was down year-over-year -- it was down year-over-year not because we lost any share, not because ASP was down. In fact, ASP was stable. Gross margin was stable. Our position in that marketplace is better than ever. The workstation marketplace was just generally soft. Two reasons, as I mentioned earlier, I think the end market was soft and the delay of the Romley platform, workstation platform, caused some delayed buying in the marketplace. But overall, the GPU marketplace was -- our GPU business was up about 15% year-over-year. And I think -- I would think that the ASPs was up.\nKaren Burns: Yes. So volume was fairly -- I mean, we had an increase in volume, but I think the bigger piece is we're selling more Kepler GPUs. And those are at higher ASPs than our older-generation Fermi. So as far as the mix in GPU, it's much richer. So yes, ASP higher overall.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dale Pfau with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nDale Pfau - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Could you talk a little bit about the integration of the voice stack on your Icera baseband with your applications processor? Other companies historically have struggled with this. Could you tell us where you are? And if you're still on track to introduce your Grey to the market here in, what, the first calendar quarter, I think, originally was where you're going to do it?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Backwards, Grey is on tract. And we have already shipped a voice stack on our Icera modem. We shipped it with ZTE. And our focus now is really move -- and that's the 3G data modem, 3G stack. We're now moving all of our focus to 4G and LTE. And so it is a very significant effort. And we have been endeavoring there for some time now. And we're quite enthusiastic about going to market with Grey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: In the Consumer business, and more specifically in the Tegra business, Jen-Hsun, how do you think about balancing the profitability versus the growth as you go forward in that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we've been investing in Tegra now for a few years. But mobile computing, as you know, is the future of computing. There is no computing beyond mobile computing in the future. Every computer will be mobile. And so this isn't really a question about we're expecting to be more or less profitable in Q3 or Q4. This is really about the future of the industry. And we, for all of the good fortune and good decisions, have gotten ourselves in a pretty great place in mobile computing. And I think that we have now an opportunity to integrate our 4G modem and expand deeper into the smartphone market; continue to execute our roadmap; and because of the enormous implications of Win RT, give us the opportunity to grow into the PC marketplace. The future of cheap PCs is really tablets, great tablets. They're likely be Win RT tablets. They could be -- they may very well be Android tablets. I could even imagine them being Chrome tablets. And so these are -- and these tablets have keyboards, of course, so they're sometimes touch tablets, sometimes they're a notebook. But I think we all recognize now that this is likely the future of the computer industry. And so I think we find ourselves in a really exciting time. And Win RT just went to market. I'm really excited about it. We're seeing people using it all over. And next year, I think we're going to see even more. And so this is pretty exciting stuff.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I guess, as my follow-up, just sticking with the Tegra side and some of the modem comments you made earlier. As far as the -- either the voice side of LTE or the fully integrated side, is there any sort of benchmarks timing-wise that we can look forward to as to when you expect those products to be available?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're taping out products now. We're taping out products, our integrated product now. And that's really the product that, that in about a year's time frame, will really, really matter to get us into a larger part of the smartphone market. In the meantime, we're also ramping into the marketplace our next-generation application processor. And so we're looking forward to a new generation of Super Phones that will be in. And so but the real big opportunity is going to come with integrated 4G modem, a processor that we internally call Grey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of questions on Tegra, if I can. You talked about developing an integrated baseband in that processor to compete against Qualcomm, I would presume, which is the dominant player there. If you look at where Qualcomm is positioned in terms of its end customers, obviously, they have Apple, and they're benefiting from that. How do you intend to kind of take share away from Qualcomm in the market? And how do you look at the market in smartphone, which bifurcated between the high end, which is Samsung and Apple; and the low end, which is ZTE and Huawei, how do you look at the smartphone market? And how do you position your products relative to the competition?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. First of all, thank you very much, Raji. I think, first of all, we have already taken share from the mobile processor companies. The fact that Tegra is already a multi-hundred-million-dollar business on its way to being much larger is taking share from someone. And so we're brand new to this marketplace. And we've only been in it for 2 years. And so this is -- we're obviously -- we're clearly holding our own. Our position is where computing is richest. If computing and a general-purpose computing platform is -- matters, if performance matters, technology leadership matters, I think we can make a real contribution. When you think about integrated modems, you're right that more companies are becoming vertically integrated. That's going to affect all of us. Samsung's desire, probably based on some questions earlier, is not to buy chips from other companies -- any companies. And so -- but we don't have Samsung as a customer today and nor do we have Apple, and so we have nothing to lose. But there are many other customers that I think are going to be pretty terrific to work with. And whether it's global Tier 1s, the global brands, whether it's LG or ZTE or HTC or Sony or Fujitsu or -- I mean, there's a large list of global phone brands that we love to partner with and that we're partnering with. There's also China. The dynamics of China is very, very different than the dynamics of the rest of the world. They have many different modem standards. They have a very large number of phone companies. And we have the software engineering capacity to be able to partner with them and to help them build amazing phones. And so I surely see what you see that there are vertical integration, and that's -- they will continue to do that. However, there's a very large market of hundreds of millions of phones that we can go and make a contribution to.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Very good. Just one last question. As you look to fiscal year 2014 on the Tegra side, any thoughts in terms of kind of what the mix could be between tablets and smartphones? And along those lines, do you see kind of ARM-based Tegra processors in the notebook market gaining some traction in fiscal year '14 or calendar '13?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. We have several segments for Tegra. There's Tegra Android phones, there's Tegra Android tablets, there's Tegra Win RT, PCs, and there's Tegra automotive. The car is the most mobile computer of all. And people know that all the cars want to incorporate computers for all kinds of reasons, whether it's infotainment, navigation or driver assistance. And this is an area where we can add an enormous amount of value. And next year, I think you're going to find that -- we're going to find that auto is likely to be its first $100 million year. Win RT is likely to be much larger next year than this year. And Tegra tablet will continue to be quite a rich business for us. And then there's the Tegra phones. So if you look at it from that perspective, tablets and automotive, the Android tablet, Win RT tablet and automotive will represent a -- the largest proportion of the overall Tegra business. And then the year after that, I hope that, with our integrated modem, Tegra could be a much larger part of the business. And with respect to PCs, tablets are the modern PCs.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I wanted to ask on the 28-nanometer Kepler GPUs. I mean, the pricing has been great. The gross margin seem to have been good. Can you help us understand what are the factors that might impact gross margins for that product, which way you think they'll be going as presumably yields improve as way for cost decline and I get -- I guess, ASPs decline? How do we think about GPU margins going forward? And also, how much is Fermi versus Kepler?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, pricing is stable. Pricing is stable because our position in the market, in the market that we serve, is better than ever. A lot of people see our GPU business as a components business selling into PC. But that is part of it. We sell GPU components to notebook OEMs. And there, the margins are much tighter. However, the other parts -- the vast majority of our GPU's profits come from, what Rob called earlier, the special-purpose PCs, PCs that are built for PC gaming. Gamers build it for PC gaming. This is our GPU architecture, our GPU stack, the software that we dedicate to games. And the work that we do with game developers all over the world makes the GeForce architecture the best in the world for PC game. The work that we do with workstations, whether it's automotive, manufacturing, digital content creation, digital broadcast, the augmented reality imagery that you saw on CNN for the election where the virtual sets look so real, it's almost like the broadcaster or the commentator was inside a pretty amazing room, all of that stuff is done using NVIDIA's Quadro GPUs. That's very software-intensive. And the vast majority of the value we deliver is software. And then, of course, high-performance computing with Tesla, tools, compilers, libraries, the computational mathematicians we have all around the world to help people optimize their software, the solution architects that are out in the field working with large customers like Oak Ridge National Labs, so that we can help them build their supercomputers. These businesses, the Tesla business, the Quadro business, the GeForce PC gaming business, are incredibly software-intensive. And there, our margins are very good, and the pricing is stable. And the reason for that is because we add a lot of value. And so my expectation is, as we continue to solidify our positioning in the marketplace and we continue to add value to our customers, the pricing should be stable.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, did you say how much was Fermi versus Kepler in the quarter just ended?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I didn't, but go ahead.\nKaren Burns: Well, we don't really disclose that. The point I was making before is it's -- like Jen-Hsun said, the price is stable, depending on the segment your in. So if you're in a high-end segment, you have a certain ASP. And then, the only point about Fermi is, as we move through a new generation, the older generations go further down the stack. So they are lower ASPs.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up question, can I ask one on the baseband efforts? It sounds like you're getting close to taping out an integrated part. I'm assuming that's 4G LTE. Are there specific geographies you're going to be targeting first? Obviously, the world is a big place. They all require different software stacks. And just what's your rollout strategy there as you go against much larger competitors?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We'll start with the U.S. We're nearing sampling of a discrete 4G LTE modem, and then we're taping out an integrated 4G LTE modem -- integrated 4G LTE application processor. And that's the reason why we are increasing our investments. Okay. I think that's what we have time for today. We look forward to talking to all of you next quarter about our Q4 results. And thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call.

During this call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release which is posted on our website. With that, let\u2019s begin. We\u2019re pleased to report a better than expected quarter driven by Kepler, the best GPU we have ever built, and Tegra 3, the world\u2019s first quad-core mobile processor. Kepler is the most capable as well as the most energy efficient GPU architecture we\u2019ve ever created. Kepler drove a record quarter for our notebook business based on the beginning of market share gains. And we believe that due to the later timing of Ivy Bridge rollout this year, the lion\u2019s share of market share gains are still to come in the third quarter. Our desktop GPU business was also up this quarter from strong GeForce GTX sales. Up to now, due to supply limitations, we have only been able to address the enthusiast market. Finally, we\u2019re able to bring Kepler to the core PC gaming market. From our data of the global install base, roughly 80% of gamers have graphics cards that are below the recommended specifications of the wave of new games coming out in the second half of the year. Kepler is the perfect upgrade for the millions of PC gamers around the world. Kepler will soon be flowing into our professional businesses. Our Professional Solutions business was down slightly in the second quarter from the previous quarter but with the recent introduction of the Tesla K10 and K20 GPU for high-performance computing, we anticipate growth again for Tesla starting next quarter as it begins to ship. Tegra had a record quarter. As you and the press have obviously noted, Tegra 3 is showing up in some of the world\u2019s most exciting mobile devices and the businesses is ramping. Google recently announced and launched to tremendous response the Nexus 7, the world\u2019s first $199 quad-core 7-inch tablet. The Nexus 7 runs the newest version of Android 4.1, Jelly Bean. It is the perfect device for the hundreds of millions of consumers who use Android phones and would like to enjoy the same content on a larger display. Microsoft this quarter, unveiled its own Windows RT powered tablet called Surface, again driven by a Tegra processor. A groundbreaking mobile device powered by Tegra 3 was Fujitsu\u2019s ARROWS X, the world\u2019s first quad-core LTE smartphone, which began shipping into Japan. Tegra processors also began shipping in automobiles this quarter, powering Tesla Motors\u2019 Model S 17-inch touch screen infotainment and navigation system, the largest ever in a passenger car. Tegra also powers its all-digital instrument cluster. For drivers, the system provides larger, more-readable maps and a beautifully rendered instrument cluster that can be personalized from the multi-function steering wheel. With that, let me hand the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. Revenue of $1.04 billion increased 13% quarter-over-quarter meeting the high-end of our outlook. Driving this strong demand for our desktop \u2013 driving this were strong demand for our desktop GTX GPUs and record quarters for our notebook and Tegra products. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 51.8% and non-GAAP was 52%, representing an increase from Q1 of 1.7% and 1.6 percentage points respectively. Improved 28-nanometer supply enabled us to ship more of our Kepler GPUs in the high-end segment. GAAP OpEx was $401.1 million and non-GAAP was $342.5 million, both much better than our outlook. GAAP OpEx was up on our announced charitable contribution of $25 million. Its net present value of $20.1 million was charged to OpEx as a nonrecurring item. Non-GAAP, which excluded this charge, was down from the prior quarter benefiting from lower discretionary expenses. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $119 million, a 97% increase over the prior quarter equivalent to $0.19 per diluted share, which was up 90%. Non-GAAP net income was $170.4 million, a 75% increase from Q1, equivalent to $0.27 per diluted share, a 69% increase. Revenue results by business segment were as follows. Our GPU business was up 15% sequentially due to the strong demand for our desktop performance and enthusiast products, and growing notebook share as the industry continues to move to the Ivy Bridge platform. Our Professional business was down 8% sequentially due to continued weak economic conditions in Europe and the slower ramp of Romley platforms. Our Consumer business was up 36% on the strength of our Tegra business.\n : For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin at 52%, flat from Q2; OpEx of approximately $350 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions in aggregate of approximately $40 million. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be in the range of $57 million to $59 million and capital expenditures of $30 million to $40 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 630 million.\nRob Csongor: That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vivek Arya.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, last year you had two very good quarters with Tegra in July and October to be followed by a quarter of some inventory adjustment. Are conditions different this year? Should we expect it to play out similarly this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we wouldn\u2019t have guided what we guided if we didn\u2019t have faith and confidence in the Tegra growth. The difference I guess may be more important to talk about is this year, I think that it is relatively clear that the Android tablet, particularly Nexus 7, the Transformers from ASUS they\u2019re doing really well. And the reason for that is because it has taken us some time to get the cost, the functionality and the quality of the experience really, really good. You now know that there are hundreds of millions of Android phones around the world and whereas the first tablets when they first came out were introduced with the Honeycomb operating system, the Honeycomb operating system was very different from the Android phone operating system at the time. But now with Jelly Bean and Ice Cream Sandwich, the applications and the investments that you make in your Android phone, all of those applications just magically show up on your Android tablet and so this Android tablet is a really wonderful, higher resolution and larger format display for you to enjoy your content when you\u2019re not running around, when you\u2019re sitting at home. And so if you haven\u2019t had a chance to try the Nexus 7 I really urge you to. It\u2019s the first thing I use in the morning and it\u2019s the last thing I use at night. And it\u2019s really wonderful that all of the applications and all of my content stay synchronized between my One X phone and the Nexus 7 tablet. And so I think that the momentum of the products that we have are much stronger. Our position in the market is much stronger. And we\u2019ll see how these devices do in the marketplace. But at the moment, we\u2019re quite confident in their position in the market.\nVivek Arya: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. And just for my follow up on the Professional Solutions business, how much of it is macro? How much of it is Romley delay? How much are product specific issues? When should we expect that to pick up? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Quadro and Tesla are unique in the marketplace and we\u2019ve gained share if anything. So the market position of Quadro and Tesla are very good. Their value proposition are very unique and the people that buy Quadro and Tesla buy it because they need it. It\u2019s not a discretionary expense. They need those products. During times when the economy is a little slower and right now, as you know, the economy is rather slow in Europe and in China that affects people\u2019s enterprise consumption. So that\u2019s a factor. The other factor is the Romley platform launch. It\u2019s a very important platform. And it started out in servers and it\u2019s in the process of moving into workstations and I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in Intel\u2019s execution. They will ramp up those workstation platforms and the OEMs are all fully charged up to ramp up those workstation platforms. And then on top of that we have the Kepler GPUs that are flowing into Quadro and flowing into Tesla and so I think the trajectory is good and I think things will work itself out.\nVivek Arya: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Wang.\nPatrick Wang: Great. Thanks for taking (inaudible). The first question, I wanted to ask you about GPU. You talked about being \u2013 still being in a supply challenged environment. I\u2019m just curious how much business you feel like you might\u2019ve left on the table? And separately, if you could talk about the trajectory of your 28-nanometer supply and whether or not you feel like your shortages are going to subside this quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have no idea how much business we left on the table. And we expect to be supply constrained throughout the quarter. We\u2019ve taken the supply constraints in consideration for our guidance. And if the supply situation comes in the way we expect, we\u2019ll have some upside. And I know that TSMC is working as hard as they can for us and so we\u2019ll report on what we learn at the end of the quarter. Thank you.\nPatrick Wang: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow up I wanted to ask about your plans on having an integrated solution. I think that some of your other competitors out there are trying to ramp at least an integrated processor baseband solution. What are your plans there? Are you guys still on track to really introduce, I guess, codename Grey, sometime in the next couple quarters here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, there\u2019s only one integrated LTE solution in the world today and I think it\u2019s pretty clear that going forward, in order to build a world-class phone and a top-tier phone, you need to have a world-class application processor which includes great CPU and great GPUs. And you need to have a world-class software stack. These phones are increasingly becoming computers. It\u2019s not just a telephone anymore. And so having a software stack that allows you to concurrently use all of the wonderful things that we\u2019ve come to know our phone and more is really, really hard to do. And there are very few companies that provide that today. And the third of course is a state-of-the-art modem and baseband. And that is exactly the reason why we bought a company called Icera. And our intention is to integrate those three major pieces to provide a really great platform for our customers. We haven\u2019t announced when Grey is going to be available in the marketplace, but we\u2019re working as hard as we can for it and when we do introduce it, it would, as you\u2019d expect and as the reason why you\u2019re asking, expand our market position and expand our market potential tremendously.\nPatrick Wang: Great. If I could squeeze in one quick last one. Congrats on the very strong guidance for the third quarter here. Can you help us understand which parts of your business may be growing above or below that 15% sequential rate that you provided? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks so much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, first of all, thank you. The GPU business is growing. GeForce is growing faster than the sequential rate. Tegra is growing much faster than the sequential rate. And the reason those two, you could probably guess, is because Quadro is not growing as fast as the sequential rate. Okay. Thank you.\nPatrick Wang: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Glen Yeung.\nGlen Yeung: Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to ask little bit about China. When you guys initially discussed Tegra 3 wins you\u2019d mentioned that China was a big component of that. And wanted to just get a sense from you how you think that business will ramp? Is it white box or branded names? And what kind of ASPs of phones will you be selling into?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, we\u2019re just now ramping into the China, what we call the affordable superphone segment. Basically, all of the capabilities of today\u2019s superphone but really engineered for affordability and Tegra 3 has such a great reputation, the software stack is really exquisite and so we\u2019re quite excited about it. There are many phones being created right now. A couple of them have been announced and we\u2019re expecting them to ramp shortly. We still expect China to be a big market opportunity for us. If you look at the overall market, the U.S. is very LTE-centric. Korea is very LTE-centric. It\u2019s very important to have LTE and we don\u2019t have a very good position there until our i500 standalone LTE modem starts \u2013 goes into production and when our integrated solution goes into production. Until then, our target is really focused on the superphone and the premium phones in the non-LTE parts of the marketplace and that would be Europe, that would be Asia and China. And so, we still expect those to be really terrific markets for us.\nGlen Yeung: Jen-Hsun, just to follow up there when you are creating an affordable superphone, obviously there\u2019s a price implication on the BoM. How much of a role do you play in that versus other components in the phone that \u2013 where they can make different choices?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re a relatively small component overall for these phones and so it\u2019s not a factor yet.\nGlen Yeung: Okay. And then one last quick question on the non-Apple tablet market, you alluded to the idea that you do see momentum there and it sounds like that momentum is better than last year. I guess really just trying to get a sense of your confidence level there, how much bigger perhaps you think the opportunity is, not necessarily for you but for the market, the non-Apple market this year versus last year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think we found the position. For every product, if you want to be like another product and something like iPad, it\u2019s not particularly a smart, smart strategy. But the Nexus 7\u2019s value proposition is not to be a cheaper iPad. It\u2019s to be a peripheral or a companion device for someone who\u2019s really invested in the Android operating system. And the Nexus 7 finally, from a tablet perspective, made it really, really easy for you to enjoy and to synchronize all of your content that you\u2019ve already invested in for your Android phone to just magically shows up on your Nexus 7 device. It tells \u2013 just picks up where I left off when I\u2019m reading a book. All of my music is there. All my books are there. All the readers are there. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s the same e-mail. It\u2019s just fantastic. And so when I\u2019m traveling, when I\u2019m running around during the day, I use my One X and when I get home I turn on my Nexus and I just pick up where I left off. And so, I think that the value proposition is just much more clear now and the build quality is fantastic. ASUS did a fantastic job. Google did a fantastic job with Jelly Bean. Google Play is really easy to use. Magazines are there. Books are there. Movies are there. And so, I think it\u2019s taken this long to really build a platform that adds value to Android users. And so that\u2019s the value proposition. It\u2019s not an alternative to an iPad. It\u2019s really a device that enhances the user experience for someone who\u2019s an Android user and there happens to be hundreds of millions of Android users. And so I think this is a \u2013 I think the niche is really well met and I think they\u2019ve done a really good job.\nGlen Yeung: That\u2019s a good answer. Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, thanks a lot, Glen.\nRob Csongor: By the way, appreciate all of the questions, but just to make sure that we give everybody an opportunity to ask a question I\u2019d just like to ask let\u2019s keep it to one question with one follow on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering if you could quantify for us in the quarter in Q2 how much was the increase in desktop versus notebook in the quarter? And then do you expect desktop or notebook to be up more for Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Desktop and notebook were both up strongly in Q2. And we expect both of them to yet again be up strongly in Q3. In the case of notebook GPUs, we\u2019re ramping \u2013 you probably know that Ivy Bridge ramp was delayed because the market was kind of soft. And now, Ivy Bridge is ramping up strongly and our market share for Ivy Bridge is the best we\u2019ve ever had and the reason why it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve ever had is because the Kepler GPU is really the best GPU we\u2019ve ever created and its energy efficiency is just so fantastic that the market demand for it is really strong, so we expect to gain share and we expect to ramp up Ivy Bridge in Q3. In the case of desktop, there are several factors working in our favor. One is the PC gaming marketplace is just really, really, really strong. PC gaming is a vibrant segment. All the game developers are talking about it. It\u2019s a platform where free to play has become very important and whether here in the United States or China or Europe, we\u2019re seeing strength in PC gaming. And we\u2019re about to introduce and we just started ramping into it, our Kepler GPU that is targeted squarely at the gamers. And the segment starts out at about $99.00 and goes all the way up to about $249.00. And those segments, we haven\u2019t been able to address until now. And we\u2019ve not been able to address it because we just haven\u2019t had enough supply. And now that the supply is starting to catch up and gives us enough supply to launch into that segment and that segment is just dying for Kepler, and finally we\u2019re be able to bring Kepler to them. And then lastly, Q2 was quite a shock in the system. We had \u2013 or Q1 was quite a shock in the system. We had the convergence of a couple of issues. One of them was the shortage of 28-nanometer supply. And that was very surprising to us and to a lot of people. And the second issue was the flood in Thailand that raised the cost of disk drives, which affects the desktop market, as you know. And both of those issues are working themselves out. And so we got a lot of positive momentum driving the desktop market. And the market is really, really strong. We\u2019re feeling a lot of positive momentum right now.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great. And then as a follow up, obviously the Tegra business very, very strong, as you mentioned. Could you maybe share with us any updated expectations in terms of Tegra revenue for the year? I think you previously guided to 540. Is it safe to say you\u2019ll exceed that this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re comfortable with that this year.\nJames Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thank you very much, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.\nRaj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company: Hi. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, in the context of the prior question about modem integration, etcetera, downstream, wondering about your view on connectivity technologies, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etcetera. How important do you think that is or not important for you over time to own those technologies? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Integration is always a good thing. Integration\u2019s a good thing. If you look at connectivity a multi-function connectivity chip goes for something along the lines of about $3.00, $3.00 to $4.00, but an LTE modem is $20.00 to $25.00. And so the important thing is to focus on the important thing first and so we\u2019ve taken off a big bite and we\u2019re working on LTE integration and so I\u2019m quite excited about the integrated version. There are very few companies in the world that have the ability to build an integrated platform based on a world-class application processor, a world-class software stack and a world-class modem and that\u2019s \u2013 they are three things that are very, very hard to do and I think we\u2019re one of those companies that can pull it together and when we get that done, we\u2019ll think about other things. But those are really by far way, way, way more important than everything else.\nRaj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company: Yeah, thanks. As a quick follow up could you comment on attach rates if you\u2019ve seen any material shift there, kind of what the trend line on attach rates is notwithstanding the share gains you\u2019re seeing on Sandy Bridge of course?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We see no change in attach rate.\nRaj Seth \u2013 Cowen & Company: Great. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.\nShawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie: Great. Thanks. Good job all across-the-board there, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nShawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie: On the graphics side you mentioned that you had a mix shift that helped you in the quarter relative to your 15% sequential increase in GPUs. I was wondering if you could add some color on what units did versus pricing sequentially.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Units were up, and pricing was probably up too. And the reason why we know that is because we experienced very strong growth in the enthusiast and the performance segment. Yet in the entry segment, the disk drive shortage and disk drive prices are, although it\u2019s getting better, the mainstream part of the marketplace is still slower than usual. That part of the marketplace is picking up, but in Q2 the strength was mostly in the performance and the enthusiast side. We just couldn\u2019t build enough.\nShawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie: So was the pricing up more than the units in Q2?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think units and pricing were both up. But I would think that pricing is up more.\nShawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie: Okay. And then just as a quick follow up to some of the supply constraints on 28, do you have any view on when that\u2019s going to normalize in terms of getting the 28 back on track and being able to have normal lead times?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re expecting to be supply constrained throughout this quarter. And then we\u2019ll report on that in Q4. But obviously it\u2019s a combination of allocation, yield and the market demand. And so those are a lot of variables. So far market demand seems very strong. And we\u2019re selling into a marketplace with quite a bit of pent-up demand for Kepler. Yields are improving. And we\u2019d like them to improve even faster because when you improve yield faster with our wafer buy business model that we talked about some three quarters ago, your units grow and your margins grow. And so we really need TSMC and they\u2019re working really, really hard to improve yield because it\u2019s good for everybody and so we need them to really focus on that.\nShawn Webster \u2013 Macquarie: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James:\n :\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it\u2019s a little early for us to talk about Windows RT. I think all of the Windows RT questions really ought to be targeted at Microsoft right now because they haven\u2019t even really launched it. They\u2019d be more than delighted to answer that.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James: But the ramp is \u2013 how about this, the ramp that you\u2019re having I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re having some a ramp into those platforms as we speak. Is that as expected? Is it better than expected or any flavor there? That would be helpful. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, what I can say about Surface RT is that we were all, including all of you, really blown away by the announcement of Surface RT. I think they\u2019ve done an amazing job and it\u2019s a really, really cool device. And so I can\u2019t say that I saw that coming. I was very positively surprised and I think so was everybody else.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James: Very well. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thanks a lot, Hans.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy was Stifel, Nicolaus.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus: Thanks, and congratulations on the quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus: Can you give us an update on your virtualization efforts both the VGX and the GRID?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are working very, very closely with our partners. The VGX is targeted at enterprise. Our partners there would include the virtualization companies, Citrix, VMware and Microsoft. The OEMs that we would be working with there are the best OEMs in the world the enterprise space. And we announced that Cisco would be working with us and so we\u2019re really excited about that work. And so all of us are working on integrating software, building servers, and introducing them to customers and so on. On the GRID side, that\u2019s targeted at gamers and cloud gaming is really quite the buzz. One of our partners was bought by Sony recently. Gaikai has been a long-time partner of ours and a development partner on GRID and they were bought by Sony recently, so that\u2019s really exciting. Now they have quite large financial backing and of course a rich library of content to bring to it. And so, we\u2019re working with the service providers on that side. We don\u2019t have any more to announce at that moment, but we\u2019re very busy working on it.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay. And you\u2019d mentioned that you expected some growth in that product group in the next quarter. Is that part of it or is that just going to be the HPC segment, or will it be the virtualization segment also? Do you expect revenue that quickly?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that we will see some shipments this year but I would expect that most of these servers will go-to-market and ramp next year in Q1 of next year. We have plenty to ship this year and I\u2019ve got \u2013 I could use all the supplies for everything else and so we have plenty to do already.\nKevin Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne, Agee.\nVijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne, Agee: Yeah, hi, guys. Good quarter here. Just wondering on the Tegra 3, what\u2019s your split between tablets and handsets? And I think I might have missed this but did you guys say you\u2019re going to integrate baseband down the road here?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, Vijay. Our split on Tegra for tablets versus phones is more tablets than phones. And my sense is that it\u2019s going to stay that way. And the reason for that is because I really feel that the market has held nice positions for alternative tablets, nice positions with really great value proposition, a really good reason to buy it and really affordable and really exquisitely made. And so, I think we\u2019re finally seeing the convergence of all of these wonderful things in non-iPad tablets. And so, we\u2019re delighted by the early success and the demand out in the marketplace for the tablets that we\u2019re in. I think tablets is likely to be a strong growth opportunity for us, as we had hoped and as we had worked on. A lot of people think that the tablet market in just a few more years will be as large as the entire PC mobile market and based on the information from people that use our tablet today, I really wouldn\u2019t be surprised by that. And so if we can protect and even grow from our current position of tablets, I think this is going to be a very, very large part of our overall business.\nVijay Rakesh \u2013 Sterne, Agee: Got it, great. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thanks a lot, Vijay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial: Thank you. So I wonder if you could talk a bit about seasonality for the January quarter and obviously you don\u2019t want to give guidance now, but given that there\u2019s a lot of sort of atypical things happening in the October quarter, you\u2019re still supply constrained, Windows 8 comes out at the end of the quarter, how should that affect what we\u2019d see as typically seasonal patterns into the January quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s too early to comment on January. We have so many new things to introduce. I think there is seasonality, there\u2019s market share, there\u2019s supply and there\u2019s new products and so that\u2019s enough variables, enough elements to consider for when we get there. But I\u2019m hoping that supply would be even more improved. I\u2019m hoping that yield would be much more improved. I\u2019m hoping that the market is reasonably robust. But mostly I\u2019m excited about the new products that we\u2019re going to ship.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial: Okay, great. And as a follow up, given what you said about 28-nanometer supply improving further and the yields improving further, how should we think of that with respect to gross margins? Is there still some increase available on the gross margin line as a result of those elements?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, back in the good old days, this is three quarters ago, when we started going into wafer buying, our margins are now very, very affected by improving yields. It is a very large lever and if there\u2019s anything that we can do to improve yields, it should be all hands on deck and there\u2019s just a lot more room to improve 28-nanometer yield to the 40-nanometer level. And so what that says is that as we ramp further and further into 28-nanometer and as we improve yield, it should improve our margins. And the leverage, as you can tell, would be quite significant. And so we should be all hands on deck to improve yield. TSMC is already all hands on deck to improve yield. Nothing could be a greater lever for their ability to increase supply for all of their customers.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial: Great. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: So everybody\u2019s interests are all perfectly aligned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from JoAnne Feeney with Longbow Research.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: Thanks, and congrats on a real nice quarter, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, JoAnne.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: Yeah, a question for you really, Jen-Hsun, just about your vision of these Android tablets. I understand the easing of barriers to adoption with the similarity of phones, but one thing we\u2019re seeing with iPads is a lot of adoption in businesses, particularly services businesses. So perhaps you could give us a sense of whether you think these Android tablets are likely to remain consumer devices? And what proportion you guys are modeling at least for the maybe percentage of users that might want to add a tablet in addition to their Android phone? So what are you thinking about in terms of your market opportunity?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think it\u2019s taken us a year-and-a-half to really even build something that appears that the market really loves. And we\u2019ve taken \u2013 during this year-and-a-half we\u2019ve worked on some \u2013 gosh, 60 tablets, maybe more. And we didn\u2019t give up on it because we believed in the future of it. And I think that people recognize now that we have a lot of expertise in building these and the tablets that we\u2019ve built are really, really delightful. And so I\u2019m really excited about the fact that the positioning of Android tablets is now finally resonating with the marketplace. If you have an Android phone, you ought to go get yourself an Android tablet because all of your content just shows up. And I think if we could \u2013 if we use that \u2013 if we extrapolate it from that, surely it\u2019s going to be a very large market. But we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see how it develops. But I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in the ecosystem and our sales ability to build even greater tablets based around Android. And you can just imagine all the things that people are now doing as they hit this tablet. It\u2019s just going to be really wonderful. So I think the positioning of Android tablets is spot on. Now in terms of enterprise, there\u2019s a couple of ways to make tablets much more delightful for enterprise users. I don\u2019t use my tablet at the office because there\u2019s just too many incompatibilities. And for me it\u2019s important for me to be able to see every number on the spreadsheet; just several of the numbers on the spreadsheet is not enough for me. And so I need to see all the numbers. And I need to see all the graphs. I need to see all the charts. It\u2019s too important to me. And there\u2019s just no reason for me to make that compromise. And there\u2019s a couple of ways to provide that. One is obviously Office and then the other is to virtualize it, which is the way Citrix does it. And Citrix and VMware and RemoteFX makes it possible for us to remote the entire PC experience to any device. And that\u2019s the reason why we created VGX and I\u2019m very excited about the work that we\u2019re doing there. It has a real potential of freeing up all of our employees so that they can use whatever device they like and still be able to get 100% compatibility. So there\u2019s a couple of ways to do that, putting Office on a tablet, the pure Office version, and then putting the PC in the server and remote and virtualizing.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks for that. And then could you perhaps give us some thoughts about your operating expenses? They\u2019ve remained rather elevated. This is an investment stage in the new business, so that\u2019s understandable. But is this something where you feel like you need to hang on to this level of cost and you just hope to grow into these operating expenses or do you envision maybe coming to a point where you\u2019ve made the investments so R&D expenses will eventually fall?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Nothing would give me more joy than for us to be able to invest even more. We have more ideas than we can invest in right now and we\u2019re trying to invest as thoughtfully and in a measured way. But as you mention, we\u2019re in the process of reinventing our company. We\u2019re the only computer technology company that has made its way from the PC industry to the mobile industry. And now we have a real position in the mobile space, whereas there were \u2013 just one year ago, I think there was an analyst report that showed some 48 application processor companies in the world and we weren\u2019t even on it. And now, we\u2019re probably number two. And so I think we\u2019re making really good progress in making our way into the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry. And I think as a computer technology company I can\u2019t imagine why, I can\u2019t imagine how long-term you could have a sustainable advantage if you\u2019re not one foot in the computer industry and one foot in the mobile computer industry. It\u2019s just too important not to be in these two segments. And so we made some investments. We\u2019re making investments to reinvent ourselves and I think that reinvention is really, really paying off.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: So it sounds like we should expect you to grow into those operating expenses over some time?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, we hope to grow our top line. I think Q2 was a good start. Q3, we\u2019ve guided to another quarter of growth and we\u2019ll take it from there.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: Any hint you\u2019d like to give us on where you might find your OpEx percentage, say, four or six quarters from now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I have no idea.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 Longbow Research: Okay. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Arnab Chanda with Avian.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Avian: Thanks. Jen-Hsun, just a couple of quick questions. First, historically I think, I remember your works Professional business actually had significantly higher margin than your other two businesses. Now you\u2019re getting mix moving towards your GPUs and you\u2019re still actually improving gross margins. Could you talk about that? Is that because of the new business model with TSMC? Is that because your cost structure is much better? If you could talk a little bit about that? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Kepler is a real margin driver and so when we ship enthusiasts, when we ship performance, those are all margin drivers. But you\u2019re right that Quadro and Tesla were both down and they both have the highest margins and also because they\u2019re the highest value and the most software-intensive parts of our business. They have much higher margins and they were both down. And so the other businesses made up for their margins and more. But it\u2019s the current business model and I prefer a die buy, to tell you the truth, and it\u2019s just because it\u2019s simpler for us and it\u2019s more predictable for us. But now that we\u2019re in the wafer buy model we just have to put a lot more intensity into yield improvement. And yield was better in Q2 than it was in Q1. We\u2019re expecting it to be better in Q3. And so we just we really have to drive the living tar out of it and be all hands on deck. It is a very, very important earnings driver for us. And we\u2019re still far away from where we need to be. And where we were before was higher than this and so 28-nanometer overall is still dragging our gross margins as a company. But we need to \u2013 we have our sights on much higher margins than this.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Avian: Great. And then I guess for the Tegra business, obviously one year has made a huge difference. Clearly it seems like nowadays people will agree there is a market for Android tablets. Could you talk about \u2013 you said phone versus tablet you\u2019re focusing more on tablets, or you think that\u2019s where the growth comes from. To the extent you can give us some qualitative idea on Windows 8 or Windows RT I guess I should say; are you talking about multiple design wins? Is it a significant contributor for Q3? And how do you see that progressing? I would really appreciate that. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have 3 design wins on Windows RT. And I think Microsoft announced \u2013 well Microsoft announced theirs. ASUS announced theirs. And I don\u2019t think the third has been announced yet. So I won\u2019t announce it for them. In the near term, tablets will be an important driver for us and the reason for that is because our segment of the phone marketplace is mostly focused on superphones and the performance phones. In order for us to grow much, much more, we have to integrate a very important piece called the LTE modem and so we have to integrate that and that\u2019s the reason why we bought Icera and when we do that, when we achieve that, our market opportunity grows substantially. It\u2019s many times larger than the current phone segments that we target. And so I think that in the next several quarters our primary focus is going to be continued smartphones or superphones and premium phones, and then of course ramping all of these tablets that we\u2019ve been designed into.\nArnab Chanda \u2013 Avian: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. It seems like your years of investment are finally paying off.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you very much, Arnab.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job on the quarter. I know you guys earlier in the year talked about 30 handsets on Tegra. Do you have any update for us there? How many of those handsets are now out on the market? How many might still be coming in the second half?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are many that have already come out from HTC; The European models, the Chinese models, the Asian models, the U.S. model is coming out soon, I think. There\u2019s the LG phones, the Fujitsu phones and now we\u2019re in the process of ramping the phones that are indigenous to the Chinese market. We\u2019ve ramped the ZTE phone. That\u2019s also a global phone and we\u2019re in the process of now ramping the superphones in the Chinese market. And so \u2013 but as you know, the real focus is to make sure that we build these phones as wonderfully as we can. I\u2019m just incredibly proud of the work that we did with HTC on the One X. It\u2019s just an exquisite phone. And so we just made \u2013 if we made a whole bunch more like that I think we\u2019re going to be in good shape.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Great. And the follow-up question is on the professional side of the business. How do we think about Quadro going forward? And can you also give us any update on your enterprise Tesla operations? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Quadro\u2019s position is better than ever. Our market share and our market position is the highest it\u2019s ever been. The technologies and the capabilities we\u2019re bringing to that marketplace we were just at SIGGRAPH this week and you might\u2019ve seen some of the announcements. The work that we\u2019re doing around Quadro plus Tesla to accelerate the design workflow is really revolutionary and people are just so excited about it because I was just reading a report today about one particular company that took a month-and-a-half to create a particular shot and is now able to do it literally in two days. So whether it\u2019s rendering or video compositing or simulation in creating those shots and most shots today have so much computer graphics in it and advertising and HD advertising is a very big part of the work that we do with Quadro. It\u2019s really revolutionized how people produce videos. And so the work that we\u2019re doing there is better than ever. And I have every confidence that as soon as the economy gets better or even if it doesn\u2019t get better, eventually people will have to upgrade their workstations because it\u2019s at the core of the work that they do. It\u2019s the creative part of their company. And so irrespective of the economy at some point that people will have to come back and buy new workstations. I think part of it is people waiting for Romley to launch. They\u2019re ramping up into the workstation space and I think that the ramp is just now ramping up. So I have every confidence that once those things get settled down that the enterprise customers will come back and buy again.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: And, Jen-Hsun, one more. You guys have a lot of cash. Got any plans for that cash?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The only plans that we have ready to announce right now is to make a lot more cash.\nCraig Berger \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Very nice. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Co.\nRaji Gill \u2013 Needham & Co: Yeah, thanks. And congrats as well. On the Tegra business it seems that most of the growth that occurred in the second quarter was coming from the tablet builds and it appears that, that\u2019s going to continue into the third quarter as well. I was wondering if you can give me any insight in terms of sell-in versus sell through. Any sell through rates you can talk about?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let\u2019s see. The first observation that you need is that most of the growth came from the tablet segment and in Q3 we expect to have even more tablets for the production. And so I don\u2019t know that I have much more insight than that. And we\u2019ll come back and report it as soon as we can. I think the highlight is just the market reception of these tablets have been better than any tablet that we\u2019ve ever (inaudible).\nRaji Gill \u2013 Needham & Co: And just last question on the graphic card side that business is growing well in light of a very tough PC environment and you expect that to grow in the third quarter. So are you seeing kind of a resurgence in PC demand given the Ivy Bridge ramp corresponding with the Ultrabook Windows 8 or is it primarily market share gains, new product, customers? Can you elaborate a little bit further on that?\nRob Csongor: Hey, Raji, could you please mute your phone? We\u2019re getting a lot of noise on it. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you, Raji. A couple of growth drivers for us in GPUs. One of them of course is the notebook design wins on Ivy Bridge and Ivy Bridge was going to ramp in Q2 and it ended up ramping in Q3. And so that\u2019s one growth driver. Our market share is going to be higher, the attach rate is stable, and Kepler is just a really wonderful GPU for notebooks because it\u2019s so energy efficient. The other growth driver is desktop. We\u2019re not seeing anything different than other people from a demand perspective, but it\u2019s important to realize that desktop for us is not the same as OEM desktop. The vast majority of our GPU for desktops are sold to gamers. There are, hard to say exactly how many hard-core gamers around the world but it\u2019s many, many tens of millions. And people estimate it somewhere around 50 million to 100 million core gamers around the world. And they upgrade their GPUs every couple years. And I think that Kepler is the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. It\u2019s the best GPU the industry has ever built and it\u2019s the best GPU in the industry today and so everybody has been anticipating the Kepler GPU for the gamer segment and we haven\u2019t been able to ramp into it because the demand or because the supply just didn\u2019t allow us to do it until now and so we\u2019re going to be quite enthusiastic ramping Kepler into the gamer market and the reception has just been fantastic.\nRob Csongor: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Your final question is going to come from Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.\nSuji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity: Hi, guys. Nice job on the quarter and the guidance. Just to follow-up on that last question, with the constraints on 28-nanometer is that impacting more the OEMs or the channel you just talked about Jen-Hsun? If it is the channel, is there the potential there\u2019s pent-up demand as that becomes available?\nJen-Hsun Huang: For desktop GPUs our desktop market, the OEM market is actually very small and it\u2019s consistent with anybody\u2019s observations. I mean we don\u2019t buy desktop PCs very much from Tier 1 OEMs anymore. It\u2019s mostly and yet the desktop PC market is really quite vibrant and the reason for that is because gamers build their own PCs and there are tens of millions of gamers all over the world. And so I think, one, that the market is very different than people expect. Two, what drives the gamers are two things. One, great games and there are just some wonderful games coming out now and PC gaming is really surging. From a technological perspective, from a game play and interest perspective, it\u2019s surging past game consoles. And then secondarily, the Kepler GPU is just so fantastic. It\u2019s the best GPU we\u2019ve ever built. And compared to what the current installed base is, it is so far superior that I think gamers have been clamoring for it. And yet, until now, the most affordable Kepler is about $400. It\u2019s only been available for enthusiasts \u2013 enthusiasts and scientists. And finally we\u2019ve been able to bring that, bring the price down to the level of a gamer \u2013 PC gamer and a volume that allows us to support the ramp.\nSuji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity: Okay and then on share on the notebooks and Ivy Bridge, in the past you\u2019ve peaked around 65%, 70%. Do you think you can go above that with the Kepler product given the competitive landscape at this point?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m not really sure. Give me a chance to see how it turns out and then we\u2019ll come back and report it.\nSuji De Silva \u2013 ThinkEquity: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yep. Thank you very much.\nRob Csongor: Okay, thank you, everyone. That\u2019ll do it for today. We look forward to talking to you about our Q3 results. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Christopher Evenden, Senior Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Ashley. Good morning, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call on the first quarter of fiscal 2013 results. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer.

With that, let me begin. Each of NVIDIA's businesses performed at least in line with expectations for the quarter with notebook graphics and Tegra coming in slightly higher than we had anticipated. As expected, we faced headwinds from the soft economy and hard, hard drive prices -- high hard drive prices, which passed the PC mix away from the channel in favor of OEMs.  However, our competitive position was enhanced in mid-March with the launch of our new Kepler GPU architecture. Kepler is more powerful, more compact and more efficient than anything before it. Kepler is also our first architecture to include virtualization technology built right into the GPU. And we'll talk more about what that means at our GPU Technology Conference next week and at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 24. Our first Kepler product was the GeForce GTX 680, which is 10% faster, 20% smaller and 22% more power efficient than its direct competitor. Of more than 130 media reviews published so far, each and every one of the recommended our GeForce GTX 680 over the competition. Kepler is the most efficient GPU architecture we've ever created and we expect this to translate into more market share and higher margins.  Less than 2 weeks ago, we launched our second GeForce Kepler product, the GeForce GTX 690, which uses 2 Kepler GPUs to set a new bar for performance. The 690 is a gorgeous piece of engineering and industrial design, and this is widely noted by the press. The public reaction speaks to its degree of craftmanship and pride our engineers and designers put into their product. PC Magazine, which is a mainstream technology publication, described it as the card to cherish. Enthusiast sites went even further with HardOCP calling it the most perfect card they've ever tested. Their review found it to be, and I quote, \"the finest looking, best performing, most efficient jewel GPU card in the world with unsurpassed design and engineering.\" And yesterday, we launched the GTX 670 to even better reviews.  These cards enter a healthy PC gaming market. We launched the 690 at our GeForce LAN/NVIDIA Gaming Festival in Shanghai. The event had 8,000 live attendees competing with a passion that has to be seen to be believed, and more than 1 million people viewed the 2-day contest online.  Note that revenue hit a record in the first quarter as we refreshed our notebook GPUs top to bottom with the launch of the GeForce 600M series. The unprecedented power efficiency of GeForce 600M notebook GPUs has enabled new notebook form factors like that of the Acer Aspire Ultrabook M3. Putting a GeForce 600M GPU in an Ultrabook makes the Ultrabook truly worthy of the ultra tag.  All indicators are that the strong growth will continue for our notebook business through 2Q -- Q2 and Q3 driven by Kepler design wins on the Ivy Bridge platform. Our visibility into OEM builds suggests that the attach rate, stable for the last 3 years, will remain strong.  We'll be instituting more Kepler GPUs in the coming quarters. Demand is high for Kepler and although supply will continue to improve, we are not able to meet all our OEM and channel demand in Q2. We do not expect the 28-nanometer supply situation to resolve itself until later this year. This is factored into our current outlook. At this point, we can sell everything we can get.  I'll now turn to our Tegra business. The world's first Tegra 3 phone was launched in February by HTC. The HTC One X is their new flagship product and has delighted reviewers worldwide. This is the first phone we've had that launched day one across multiple carriers. Tegra 3 gives it a long battery life, thanks to the 4-PLUS-1 quad-core architecture, console gaming -- console quality gaming and fast web browsing. And because Tegra 3 utilizes a specially enhanced 40-nanometer process, it's not affected by 28-nanometer supply constraints.  Other phone wins around -- announced at Mobile World Congress includes ZTE with the first Tegra plus Icera phones, Fujitsu, LG and K-Touch. Tegra 3 phones are now shipping from 22 carriers in Europe and Asia and more will follow shortly. The launch this past quarter of the first 2 phones with Icera baseband processor signals a new opportunity for NVIDIA to penetrate the mainstream smartphone market and to capture a greater share of the silicon bond in each phone. Looking forward, you'll see Tegra 3 LTE phones with partners' baseband processors in the second half of this year and then next year with our own LTE baseband processors as well.  Additionally, we remain very excited about Tegra's opportunity in Windows on ARM. Progress continued this quarter with Microsoft shipping development PCs powered by NVIDIA's Tegra 3 mobile processor to Windows 8 developers and to device makers. Microsoft, itself, has made some important recent announcements about Windows on ARM, particularly those referring to its ability for enterprise application. And related, Forrester has predicted that 375 million tablets will ship in 2016 and almost 1/3 of these will be bought directly by business. Even for the rest, Forrester believes that most consumers will use them for work as well as at home.  Before handing things over to Karen, I'd like to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference takes place next week. We're bringing together several thousands of sciences, engineers and academics together to share, learn and network. Jen-Hsun will be presenting a major keynote at 10:30 a.m. on May 15, and it's well worth listening online if you can't be there in person. We'll also have keynotes from a Princeton researcher using GPUs to model collective behavior and the leader of a team competing for the Lunar X PRIZE. Many of the best minds in computing will be there.  Finally, I want to highlight our Annual Investor Day on May 24. If you'd like to attend, please e-mail me or visit our website at nvidia.com/ir to register.  Now, over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Chris. Revenue was at the high end of our outlook at $924.9 million on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs we launched in the quarter, as well as from strong performances in our notebook and Tegra businesses. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 50.1%. Non-GAAP was 50.4%, both at the high end of our outlook, again on the strength of our new Kepler GPUs and desktop and notebook. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 1.3 and 2.1 percentage points lower than the prior quarter, respectively, largely due to the impact of 28-nanometer supply shortage that we experienced for our new Kepler products. GAAP OpEx was $390.5 million, non-GAAP was $348 million, both slightly above our outlook. The quarter-on-quarter increase was largely attributable to planned hiring and related infrastructure spending to support our strategic businesses as well as the impact of the payroll FICA tax reset that affects every first quarter.  These results contributed to a GAAP net income of $60.4 million for the quarter or $0.10 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income of $97.5 million or $0.16 per diluted share, both slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. Revenue results by business segment were as follows: Our GPU business was down 6.7% quarter-on-quarter due to the 28-nanometer supply shortage, which largely impacted our high-end desktop business as well as shorted supply for our new Kepler GPUs for notebook. Our professional business was down slightly at 4.2% from the fourth quarter, within normal seasonality. Our Consumer business was up 20.8% on the strength of our Tegra business as we've launched Tegra 3 for smartphones and tablets, offset by a decrease in our embedded business.  For GAAP, our outlook for the second quarter is as follows: revenue of $990 million to $1.05 billion, gross margin of 51.2% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $418 million.  Our GAAP OpEx outlook for Q2 includes a onetime charge related to our corporate donation to Stanford Hospital of $25 million payable over a 10-year period.  We approximate our tax rate for the quarter at 20% plus or minus 1 percentage point. For non-GAAP, we expect the following differences from our GAAP outlook: gross margin of 51.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, OpEx of approximately $354 million, which excludes the $25 million onetime charge related to our contribution to Stanford, as well as stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisition. Outlook for the second quarter depreciation and amortization are expected in the range of $55 million to $57 million and capital expenditures of $35 million to $45 million. Diluted shares are expected to be approximately 628 million.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Karen. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions. Ashley?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just looking for the forward guidance, what are your segments doing specifically between the 3 main segments of your business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I guess they're all up.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Are there any specific drivers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I'm sorry?\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I thought you were done. Go ahead.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, we're expecting them to be all up. Supply is still constrained, and our manufacturers are working their hearts out to catch up to our demand. But at the moment, demand still continues to exceed supply, and we expect that to happen for throughout the year as Chris was saying earlier. But Kepler is a fantastic, fantastic GPU. This is arguably the best we've ever made, and we've made some pretty fantastic GPUs over the years, and we're just in the process of rolling out Kepler into each and every one of our businesses and -- starting with desktop. There are still many, many segments within desktop that we're expecting to transition into Kepler throughout the year and throughout next year. There's a notebook that's in the process of rolling out now, and we started shipping this quarter and that -- or this last quarter, and that explains the big jump up and we're expecting another jump up this coming quarter. But Kepler is our GPU that goes into GeForce and Quadro and Tesla. And this upcoming week at GTC, I'd love to tell you about some of the new ideas around GPUs, and so Kepler is the core of many of our businesses. And when our GPU architecture is incredibly successful, you could see it drive all of our businesses for several years. And so my guess is that this will do again the same. And of course, Tegra 3 is ramping as we talked about before. Although we don't have LTE at the moment, LTE is predominantly a U.S.-centric phenomenon. Outside of the United States, the big superphone upgrade is quad-core. And Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core and it's even a special quad-core at that with 4-PLUS-1, and it's got NVIDIA's branded graphics and all of our style of doing wonderful graphics and the video games and the content really shows. And so Tegra 3 is the next major upgrade for superphones in Europe and in China and elsewhere. And then towards the end of the year, we hope to bring Tegra 3 with LTE phones to United States.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I think this is my one follow-up. On that 28-nanometer shortage side of things, do you expect the solution to that problem to be more yield-driven by your primary supplier or -- I think in the past you've talked about looking to potentially diversify to additional foundries, so would the supply coming on from those potential suppliers fix the problem as well?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yields of 28 are probably the best of any new node that TSMC has ever done. They've done a great job with 28, and I think that it also explains the demand on their 28. It's yielding wonderfully at this point in its ramp. The performance is fabulous. The efficiency, energy efficiency, is terrific. So I think it explains the reason why the demand is so great for this particular node. I think the increased supply will have to come from increased capacity and it's -- we're short now, and every chip that they can come out of their fab is being shipped instantaneously. We've reduced cycle time dramatically between us and our customers, and we're trying to get the products to market as quickly as possible. And so I expect us to be supply constrained from wafers at the wafer level, and we'll continue that way throughout the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Berenbaum with MKM Partners.\nDaniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Maybe just to follow up on Ross' question a little bit. So your 28-nanometer yields are good and we've heard this from other -- from some of your peers as well who are also constrained by TSMC supply. Was the problem that the customers of Taiwan Semi just didn't give a bullish enough forecast so that TSMC didn't add sufficient capacity, or was there sort of a misunderstanding in the planning process? Can you maybe help us understand a little bit of the dynamic that's going on between you and your supplier?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think clearly, clearly, there just isn't enough capacity, and we've expected a really, really successful Kepler launch. And the reason for that is because we've known for some time that Kepler is going to be a fantastic GPU and we've had big plans for Kepler, and we invested last year rather aggressively on the various designs of Kepler and all of the capabilities that people were starting to learn about Kepler, and there are many more to come. And we made those investments because we expected to be able to grow the market, and there's every evidence that we're growing the market. There's just not enough capacity and the planning process when we think about these new nodes, it just simply needs to be better. And I don't think there's any way around that. In combination between us and TSMC, we under planned for the supply of 28-nanometer, and we need to fix that in the future.\nDaniel A. Berenbaum - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: So is this something that can simply be fixed by better planning, or is there really sort of a more structural change where TSMC is the only option at 28-nanometer, at least for some period of time, and getting the 20-nanometer will clearly have a lead among the other foundries of 20-nanometer. Is that a structural change where you're seeing potentially lower margins because you're much more tied to just the one supplier?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I don't know that it's a structural change in the sense that if TSMC and ourselves were to have properly planned for this ramp, we wouldn't be shorting our customers so severely at the moment. And if we can make plenty of high-end GPUs like Keplers, our margins would be fine. And so it's really a shortage of supply that is causing our margins to be compressed at the moment, but we expect that to be cured as we go through the year. In terms of planning, that's a -- and building capacity, that's something that only TSMC can decide and ultimately, the industry will sort itself out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, how much did the Tegra business grow in the first quarter? I know you were expecting it to grow at least 50%, and I'm assuming Tegra is going to contribute to the growth in the July quarter. Is the growth there going to be more driven by customers ramping new smartphones or new tablets or a combination of both? And then I have a follow-up.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Tegra grew 50% or more as we expected this last quarter, and we're expecting it to grow again this coming quarter. We launched the first phone in one region. The first phone was HTC's One X and the region was in Europe. Now it's expanding in Europe, and we're expecting to go through more regions with HTC. And then there are many other Tegra 3 phones that are teed up and coming to market. And so we're expecting the phone segment of Tegra 3 to continue to grow. There's also tablets. Tablets are doing very well for us. It represents about half of the overall demand at the moment, and there's some pretty exciting tablets that are about to come out throughout this year that we're working on. One particularly is, of course, Windows on ARM, and the enthusiasm behind it is growing every day. So it's a fantastic tablet, and I can't wait to show it you. And so I think the answer is to your question is yes to both. We're expecting to see growth in both tablets as well as phones.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then obviously, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about under shipping demand in both the desktop and notebook segments in Q1. Can you just quantify roughly dollar-wise how much more revenue you could have shipped in Q1? And given obviously the constraints here in Q2, what the rough dollar impact on July sales could be as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We haven't broken it out, but it's a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.\nChristopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question -- I guess trying to understand both the impact of the shortage of 28-nanometer but also you guys moving from good die to full wafer pricing, how should we think about the impact to gross margins today and literally, I guess, through the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, when we don't have enough of our premium products, then that will hurt our margins the most. And so I think at the moment, it's safe to say that supply is what's constraining, what's holding our margins back. As supply improves and yields will be improving throughout the year, I think we have every chance and every possibility of delivering great margins again. And so I think the #1 issue for us right now is just to make sure that we have enough supply of Kepler GPUs. And if that comes through, the margins will take care of itself.\nChristopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, can you talk about the attach rates with Ivy Bridge ramping? Usually, you talk about design wins. Would love to get some color there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We expect to gain share in Ivy Bridge and we expect Ivy Bridge to likely be the best node, if you will, best processor platform that we've ever participated in. Primarily, the reason for that is because Kepler is such an energy-efficient GPU and the performance and the energy efficiency of the performance is just the best in the world, and I think that people are recognizing that. Ivy Bridge hasn't really changed anything from our perspective. The market structure seems to be consistent as it was before. Consumer demand continues to be quite high and consumers -- one of the most important applications for it is video games, and video games still prefer to have GeForce. And so I think all of those dynamics are still consistent. OEMs still would like to have ways to differentiate their products, and adding the GeForce processor has been one of the best ways to differentiate and create a premium segment and it remains that way. And so whether it's thinner notebooks or Ivy Bridge, I don't think that, that's really changed the dynamics. So we're expecting attach rates to be quite healthy and consistent with the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: When you talked about yields on 28-nanometers being so good at the moment, so as you do ramp Kepler and it matures somewhat, do you expect to get higher gross margins on this than prior-generation 40-nanometer chips? And also, are the shortages you're seeing on 28-nanometers translating into any upward pressure on wafer prices, or have you got pricing locked in for the Kepler generation?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The second question, I kind of lost a couple of bits. What did he say?\nChris Evenden: He said because supply is short, are wafer prices going to go up or are prices locked in.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think the second question I have a better answer on. We have an understanding about wafer prices from TSMC and we negotiate with them and we now both understand where the pricing is, and so I don't expect a pricing increase and I surely hope it doesn't happen. With respect to margins, the reason why margins are great on Kepler is because it's a really efficient GPU. It's higher performance, it's lower power and for every performance level, it's also very efficient in terms of die size. And if that's the case, then our margins would lift. It is the most efficient architecture we've ever done and certainly relative to Fermi, our last-generation GPU, Kepler is much more efficient. And as you know, efficiency drives productivity, and in this particular case, productivity is margins. And so I expect that the more Kepler we ship, the higher our margins would lift. And so the really big focus for us is just to continue to ship as many Keplers as we can.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's great. And also on Tegra 3, you said that it's roughly 50-50 smartphone and tablets. Given your current design wins as again as the year progresses, do you expect that to stay 50-50 or is it going to be more skewed towards either smartphones or tablets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Windows on ARM is going to be the big variable on that. And at the moment, it's running 50-50 and about. And throughout the next quarter, my expectation is that phones would exceed tablets. But towards the end of the year, latter half of the year, the question is how does Windows on ARM do. And so that's the biggest lever, and we can report on that a little bit later.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.\nBrendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: A follow-on, on the handset business. If you could, just maybe as the year progresses here, give us some indications on your baseband business, particularly on the LTE part of that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. Well, we're really targeting the superphone segment of the marketplace. And when you look at the superphone segment of the marketplace, call it 100-plus million units a year or so, that part of the marketplace really is shared by 2 -- from a merchant semiconductor perspective, 2 players. Our focus -- because we didn't start from the modem business, we really focused on computing and graphics, we focused on segments of the marketplace where LTE isn't necessary at the moment and where it's just not ready for LTE. And so Europe, Asia, basically everywhere outside of United States has been our primary focus. Towards the end of this year starting in Q3-ish, we're working with LTE vendors and LTE partners to bring Tegra 3 and LTE phones to the rest of the markets. And so our primary focus at the moment is it's outside of United States. In the second half, in the United States, we'll bring LTE and Tegra devices into United States.\nBrendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Excellent. And then my second question would be on the consumer side, if you could give any sort of indication of what the royalty piece -- portion of that is in the quarter.\nChris Evenden: You're talking about Sony there, Brendan?\nBrendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Yes.\nKaren Burns: We don't disclose that.\nChris Evenden: Yes, we don't break it out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, if you look at the PC guys that reported in April, they guided up a few percent, which was certainly better than seasonal. My question is on your Consumer GPU business, how much of the strength are you seeing is really driven by the channel restocking versus some of the share gains you've outlined with Kepler?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There's really 2 factors that's driving our growth, and one is 28-nanometer supply. There's just more of it than last quarter. I would say last quarter was not a typical quarter for us. I would characterize last quarter as a difficult quarter, and it was completely supply constrained. And this coming quarter, we're still supply constrained. And although it's a significant growth quarter, it is still difficult from my perspective, and the supply is still far short of demand. And the second part of our growth comes from Tegra 3's ramp, and we're really fortunate with Tegra 3 to have chosen an enhanced version of the 40-nanometer process. This is a technology called LPG, and we're the only one in the world using it. And it is a balance between high performance as well as extremely low power. TSMC did a fabulous job with us on that, and I really appreciate it because now we can support Tegra 3's ramp without consuming more of the 28-nanometer wafers that we can allocate to Kepler. And so I think the answer is, quite simply, more supply and more supply of 28-nanometer and Tegra 3's ramp that's contributing to the growth.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: All right. My follow-up is on the cash balance. If you consider how the stock performed during the quarter and how much cash you generated on your balance sheet, if the cash balance is about 40% of your total market cap, and my question is are you managing or do you plan to manage the cash to a certain level considering the valuation? What are your thoughts around doing a share repurchase program or instituting a dividend?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We haven't -- we don't have anything to announce today, and that's a topic that we have with the board on a regular basis. But we don't have anything to announce today.\nKaren Burns: Just if I may, I'd like to give a little more clarity on the previous question from Brendan. On CPB, the royalties were flat and embedded, as you know, and our CFO commentary is down. So if directionally, that helps you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Jen-Hsun, I had actually 2 questions for you. The first one was we were all in a room all day yesterday at a small company in Santa Clara and there was a lot of talk about the structural advantage that Intel had going down in node. So just wanted your perspective since you do -- are one of the fabless companies that uses leading-edge technology and ultimately the first and the follow-up to that -- kind of related to that was as we go down in node, and some of the fabless companies have talked about going down in 20-nanometer, and what does that do to potentially margin or affects headwind. So what is your perspective on both those topics?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think our partner for advanced nodes is doing quite a nice job, I think, and I expect TSMC to continue to be able to advance their capabilities on an ongoing basis. There's nothing that would suggest that TSMC doesn't have the scale or the capabilities to do so. They're manufacturing an enormous number of wafers by anyone's standards, and so I think the availability of leading-edge wafers is not something I'm overly concerned about. In terms of process technology, it's also important to recognize that CPU's needs for process technology and SoC's needs for process technology is similar but not the same. And TSMC's leadership and density is something that can't be ignored. People always talk about one dimension of the semiconductor process, which is the transistor, but metallization is increasingly, especially for SoCs, by far, the most important variable. And so I think that we just need to be careful not to get -- drink too much marketing bathwater when we think about the technology variable because it's so complicated and SoCs are very different than CPUs. And so let's see, the second is margins. Our job is to make sure that we continue to create efficient architectures that are highly valued, and I think that if we continue to do and create GPUs like Kepler, I think we're going to be doing just fine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Could you help us understand the dependency on 28-nanometer? What percent of your mix is it now? And at what point do you think we'll cross over to, say, the 50% of your output coming from 28? And I have a follow-up.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think we're expecting it to be about 30% this coming quarter. We'd like it to be a lot more.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And can you give us any idea when you think you can reach 50%?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, this coming quarter's about 30% is my estimate. Next quarter will be more than that, and the quarter after that will be even more than that. And so hopefully, we cross 50% as soon as possible. We would like to cross this as quickly as possible.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then my follow-up is really sort of an add-on to the previous question, and that relates to the efficiency that you're gaining at the advanced node. If they're so -- I guess I share your commentary that there isn't much risk of development of advanced process technology. I think the question comes into the economic advantage that the advanced technology is going to deliver. Are you getting the cost reduction? Clearly, 28 appears to be delivering that. Is the forecast for the next node going to give you an equal cost-to-benefit ratio or are you starting to see sort of a slowing of benefit as we go to these advanced nodes because they are so complex?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Every -- by the way, every node is complex. This is a conversation that we have at every node and we take every node seriously. And there's no evidence that anyone is becoming increasingly complacent, and so I think these are typical conversations to have. With respect to efficiency or productivity of each node, we will go into the node when it delivers value for the products that we need to create. And so if it makes no sense to go to a new node, we wait until it make sense to go to a new node. And so there isn't anything that -- nobody is in automatic cruise control, and we look at each node carefully with TSMC and we try to adjust each node if we can improve it for our products and otherwise. And then based on those analysis, we decide which products and when should go into the new nodes. And so it just simply needs to be analyzed. I don't -- there's nothing that suggests that the next node is going to be unproductive. If it's unproductive, it won't get used, and so my expectation is that it will be productive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Uche Orji with UBS.\nUche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just real quick. As we look at the gross margin issues, can you talk about -- because one of the areas you've highlighted in the past is PSB and the future opportunities that, that brings. What are the gross margin drivers for going down the line, and I'm talking about looking at other areas, so if you can talk specifically on PSB. And also on Tegra, as these constraints happen across the group and then Qualcomm talked about it, do you see yourself increasingly gaining share going down the line on Tegra 3? That's my first question, please.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. First, I'll answer the question backwards. Well, the answer is yes, we're gaining share. And the reason for that is because we were a very small player before. And as a discrete application processor provider, we've gained quite a bit of share. If you look at their market, our competitor's market -- business around discrete application processors, I think that you'll find that our share is growing quite rapidly. And so my expectation is that as we grow throughout the year that we're doing so because we're growing share, number one. Number two, PSB's gross margins are healthy and slightly improving, and the reason for that is because we continue to add more value to the high end of the visual computing market. Digital content creation is a growing market, and more and more of design is moving to digital forms, and this is an area that we are world leaders at and this is an area that we continue to add a lot of value to the industry on. And so as we increase value to the marketplace, we'll reward it with higher margins. And our focus is to make sure that PSB, where we have extremely high share already, that we continue to help grow the market. And that's one of the focus next week of GTC. If you all have a chance to either tune in or come even down to GTC, you're going to find some really, really fantastic work being done around the world by our partners and content developers who are using our technology to create wonderful assets and create wonderful things and discovery of new science.\nUche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right. Let me just ask you a second question. Can you give us any updates on Windows on ARM as well the efforts in terms of timing of products coming, especially as Intel is making a big push in that category as well on the tablet front? So any commentary on development on the PC form factor on tablets and Windows 8 and regarding timing as well, that'd be helpful. That's one question. And then two, Kepler, it's been said that you will need Kepler in volume to be able to increase discrete attach rates in Ultrabooks. Any commentary as to the attach rates in Ultrabook in general? And how much of that is going to be Kepler? And how much of that will be a print [ph] products? That'll be helpful.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Windows 8 tablets and Windows RT tablets are very different things. Windows 8 x86 tablets and Windows on ARM tablets are very different things. And as Microsoft goes to market, people will understand why we're so enthusiastic about Windows on ARM. They're just very, very different things, and so I'll let Microsoft tell you about their plans, but I'm very enthusiastic about it. I think it makes a lot of sense for enterprise. Anybody who has a large part of their work around Windows would really benefit from Windows on ARM tablets and all the Windows on ARM devices -- range of devices that will be following after that. We've shipped about 1,000, maybe more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM, or Microsoft has shipped more than 1,000 Tegra Windows on ARM tablets for software developers, and that number is growing very rapidly. And so we're working very closely with them to march to market with an exciting product as quickly as we can. Ultrabook, we see no difference between an Ultrabook and a PC. It's a thinner PC, but PCs have been getting thinner. And there's plenty of room from a thermal or mechanical or electrical perspective to support a GPU. And the reason why people put GPUs in their notebooks is because it helps them deliver a premium device. It also enables consumers the ability to enjoy multimedia better. And so I don't see any difference relative to attach rates when it comes to Ultrabooks. And then with respect to Kepler, Kepler is our primary focus for next-generation notebooks and we're trying to build as much as we can. And the more that our supply catches up to the demand, the more our customers can ship Kepler GPUs. Everybody is really, really anxious to get more, and so we need to just make more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Gelbtuch with Cantor.\nDaniel M. Gelbtuch - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: Just digging a little deeper into Tegra. I was just wondering if you could compare and contrast how Tegra really, not only from a efficiency perspective, how it compares with the current status quo in the market, number one. And number two, with regard to SDR or software-defined radios and Icera, how do you think that changes the landscape for LTE, I guess, next year and the year -- and beyond?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Tegra 3 is the world's first quad-core processor. And it's not only quad-core, as you might know. It has a really energy-efficient CPU core as well. And so not only does it deliver higher performance, it's also more energy efficient than the status quo. And of course, with all of the products, the graphics and the video games are just so much better. And so I think that based on the demand and the reception in the marketplace for the first Tegra 3 phone, I think it's safe to say that Tegra 3 is really the standard by which everything is being compared, number one. Number two, software-defined radio, there's no question that SDR allows us to deliver a much smaller and efficient and cost-efficient modem. And with LTE, it is very clear that the die size is smaller, the energy efficiency is excellent and that's really going to help, especially with capacity being so constrained. Having a very small modem, a very small LTE modem, is going to be a big differentiator for us. Not only will we be able to make more of integrated versions of application processors and LTE modems, we'll also be able to bring more cost-effective solutions to the marketplace. So we're really, really gunning for that and running as hard as we can.\nDaniel M. Gelbtuch - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division: So is it fair to say that once you get this integration of SDR rolling, this would be perhaps the first time that the current incumbent in the APE space is going to be seeing some serious -- a real competitor?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the incumbent is a really good company, and they're very competitive. And this is new for us, and we still have a lot to learn and we're learning as fast as we can. But the Icera SDR modem is really revolutionary and when we can combine that -- and there's every evidence it works great. We're shipping phones now. There were people said that we couldn't get that modem to market, people said that we couldn't get phone's voice to work. But obviously, all wrong. We're now certified on LTE and we're in the process of getting products to market. And so these are all barriers that we have to overcome, but we're taking it -- ticking it off one at a time and we're -- I'm cautious, but very enthusiastic about the technology we're bringing to the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Suji De Silva with ThinkEquity.\nSujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: So first question, Jen-Hsun, on this Kepler architecture and the energy efficiency of it as you described it, how do you monetize that? Is that smaller die or is that a value proposition that customers pay for and just allows you to kind of get that upgrade?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, absolutely both, absolutely both. Kepler is the most energy-efficient. It's also the most die size-efficient GPU we've ever made. The performance per watt and the performance per millimeter are both the best that we've ever done. It was a huge drive for our company to transform ourselves in just about every single dimension from architecture to design to implementation to software. We pulled everything together for Kepler. When you're more energy-efficient, at any level of power that the system can provide will be higher performance. And so if the system can provide 300 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide for only 10 watts, we're higher performance. If the system can provide 1 watt in the future, we'll be higher performance. So energy efficiency is incredibly important. And of course, at any price point in the marketplace, if we are efficient with respect to die size, that can only help our gross margins. Whatever gross margins we had at the Fermi generation, so long as market dynamics remain similar, I expect our gross margins to be higher than the Fermi generation wherever that happens to be. And so that explains why I'm so impatient to get Kepler lined [ph] up and why we need so much more Kepler supply from TSMC.\nSujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division: Understood. And my other question, Jen-Hsun, is in January, you had a Microsoft representative in CES and you asked them about how Windows -- Microsoft would avoid confusion as Windows on ARM came out, and you may defer this question to Microsoft, but what's your update on that thought as we look ahead to Microsoft tablets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think you guys are going to really like the answer. They've been very thoughtful about the segmentation of the Windows -- the next Windows generation. There are different customers with different needs, and I think you're going to find their answer rather thoughtful. I'm very pleased with where they ended up and I think it's going to really, really, really help the positioning of the Windows on ARM tablets because they're very different than those -- than x86. It's a new product category. I think you're going to find that they're really desirable, and they're going to bring a lot of value to the marketplace. For people who -- where Windows and Office is still a very central part of their digital experience, I think you're going to find that this is really the best tablet on the planet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: The question I have is on Tegra. I just wondered if you can update us on the annual guidance that you had given at the start of the year. Any changes to that, any additional color?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thank you. No, no change to that. No additional color. The 3 growth drivers for Tegra are: One, phone design wins; and two, because we've successfully reduced the costs of tablets, we're starting to reach price points of Android tablets that are really resonating with the market and of course, the Android tablets are just getting better and better all the time, and Tegra 3 Android tablets are really delightful. And there's a whole bunch of new tablet that are coming starting now and towards the end of the year. And then the third driver is Windows on ARM. That's coming together really nicely, and I think that people are going to be quite delighted by it. And so those are really the 3 primary drivers and they, all 3, remain drivers at the moment.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a question on the OpEx. The OpEx went up about 7% sequentially. It's being guided up again. So now we're kind of at the high end of your OpEx range. How should we look at the OpEx throughout this year? Do you think you could really go past that range? What -- how do you think we should look at it next year? And along those same lines, are we starting to be kind of a return on investment on the Icera?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We are going to do the best we can to stay at the guidance level that we provided previously. Now if there -- if some of the new initiatives in our company starts to gain traction, we'll increase the level of investment to take that to market. But we'll play that as we go. But at the moment, our current plan is to stay as close as we can to the guidance that we provided before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Berger with FBR Capital Markets.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Can you help us understand the impact Kepler's having on GPU ASPs and what ASPs did in desktop and notebook in the first quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the more -- because Kepler comes in through the performance segment and the enthusiast segment, it naturally lifts ASPs. The more we ship, the more -- the higher our ASPs will be. And so Kepler ASPs are higher than Fermi ASPs because they target the premium segments. Kepler margins are better than Fermi margins because they're in the enthusiast segment and the performance segments, also because they're so much more energy-efficient and so much more die size-efficient. And so I think the simple answer is we just need a lot more Keplers, and the demand for Kepler is really, really high in desktops, in notebooks. The gamers come out and refresh their PCs once every few years. And on all accounts, Kepler has been a complete home run. And this is -- it's pulling people out to refresh their PCs, it's -- and PC gaming is really vibrant right now. And so I think those factors are really driving Kepler. So the more we can build, the higher ASPs we will be and surely the much higher margins we will be.\nCraig Berger - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: As the follow-up, can you update us on your CFO search? And then really I wanted to ask again on the OpEx. I know it was just asked, but can you just reiterate what was your guidance? And you said you might spend more; is that more than you're spending now, more than your guidance? And what's the time line there because, I mean, from my perspective, you did better on revenues, you did better on gross margins and my model is still challenged because of the OpEx. And so that's kind of disappointing.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The guidance that we gave you on OpEx is exactly the guidance we gave you on OpEx. And so we just provided the guidance and that's what it was, and that's what we're planning. With respect to -- what was the first question, CFO search? I think my CFO is doing fabulously, and she's doing a fantastic job with the business. And we're looking. And if there's a world-class CFO that we fall in love with, certainly we'll consider. But Karen's doing a fabulous job.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions.\nChris Evenden: All right. Thanks, Ashley. Thanks, everyone, for listening in, and we look forward to talking to you soon about our second quarter results.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Revenue came in well above our outlook driven by high-end PC gaming. Our GeForce business benefited from the launch of many excellent graphically intensive games including Call of Duty: Ghosts, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Batman Arkham Origins. In Asia Blade and Soul has proved hugely popular. It has very high system requirements relative to the vast majority of games played in China, which is a very promising development that is driven GeForce GTX sales there. The PC gaming market is now launched in console gaming or mobile gaming according to TSC intelligence. The same format makes revenue from graphics intensive PC games will approach $20 billion this year. We\u2019ve recently added a physical charter [ph] blade to enable gamers to save and share their best moments. They\u2019ve already saved over 3 million clips. If this seems like a niche application, consider that Twitch TV, which exists the string game play to global audience and leverage shader play with actually the fourth largest generator of internet traffic in the U.S. for the week ending February 3rd. That put it on Netflix but ahead Hoodoo and Amazon. On the special side of the business, Tesla has established its position at the center of the high performance computing market. This quarter we Tesla partnership with IBM, possibly the biggest name in supercomputing. According IDC 32% of all HPC computing systems are build by an IBM. Having IBM\u2019s world spanning sales force pitching Tesla is a natural consequence of the agreement. But perhaps is more interesting that IBM is looking to apply GPU acceleration across its entire portfolio of enterprise applications, potentially opening up very significant new market for us. The top ingredient supercomputers are now powered by Tesla GPU accelerators and it is the fastest supercomputer in Europe. And only this week Ansys announced for the fluid dynamics application is now accelerated by Tesla. Ansys fluid is the world\u2019s most widely used commercial HPC application. More than 40,000 companies worldwide depend on Ansys in industries from consumer products to civil engineering. We lost the Tesla K40 this quarter. It has doubled the memory of past products and we are seeing a lot of interest from consumer internet companies as we expand our market footprint into big data analytics, the topic we will explore further at our investor day next month. GRID is our GPU accelerated cloud computing platform. Our invention of the virtual GPU gives OEMs a major weapon to help drive virtualization across every aspect of the enterprise, including desktop PC applications. The number of GRID trials continues to grow strongly up 46% from last quarter. Enterprise IT purchases have a long buying process, but they are long-term and we are looking forward to share more when the time comes. In mobile we launched our latest Tegra system on chip at the CES Show in January. Tegra K1 is our first mobile processor to incorporate the capital GPU Architecture and is the first mobile processor to deliver PC class graphics. This means we can leverage our investments and those of others in the PC and console ecosystems. For example on Epic's Unreal Engine 4 now runs on Tegra K1. PC and console game developers can port modern AAA Titles to android platforms powered by Tegra. And developing android as a major game platform is an important element of our strategy and we are excited about Unreal Engine running on Tegra K1. so too is Tim Sweeney founder of Epic Games and developer of the Unreal Engine. He said he didn\u2019t think the industry would be at this level on mobile for another three or four late years. Tegra K1 is quite literally game changing. During on CES event we showed android running on a 64-bit Tegra K1. The CPU was our own custom Denver call and it is the first time anyone, who had publicly shown android running on a 64-bit chip. We expect devices based on the 32-bit version of Tegra K1 to ship in the first half of 2014 and 64-bit of devices in the second half. Along with PC graphic features Tegra also brings CUDA to mobile with 192 fully programmable processor cores. So, it can be used the greatly accelerated applications like image recognition or computational photography. For tablets and phones we can imagine a future with devices that see your face and adapts to your moods or open a browser in response to adjust you. For cars however the implications are quite startling. At CES we demonstrated K1 recognizing in real-time the white lines on a road from a video feed. It simultaneously identified other vehicles ahead and traffic signs at the side of the road. These capabilities are the fundamental building blocks at the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems that manufactures will include in future cost, with all these CES keynote where Jen-Hsun spoke, one of that vehicles drove itself on to the stage at now we announced that Tegra K1 will power it\u2019s product to driving and self parking initiatives. Specialty analytics expects the market for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems to be worth around $15 billion by 2016 with a CAGR of 23%. As he also announced for this next generation in-vehicle systems will be powered by Tegra. these include a revolutionary high resolution digital cockpit with 3D graphical displays that we\u2019ll start shipping later this year as an automotive grade smart display winning android for integrated passenger entertainment. increasingly, the driver of AKAI is surrounded by pixels and the quality of those pixels communicates as much about the car as once did in light walnut and hand stitched leather graphics matters. Repeatedly, Audi\u2019s Chief Engineer Electrical Electronics noted that 90% of the innovation in automobiles today involves history of electrical and electronics NVIDIA\u2019s automotive initiative is focused squarely at this car revolution. as we start fiscal 2015, we have 64% of the PC discrete graphics market, 81% of workstation graphics units and Tesla in pilot projects at 44% of all HPC sites. these numbers are from Mercury, Odyssey and Intersect360 respectively. Tegra 4 has shipped in tons in China and our motive has been certified by both AT&T and Vodafone, our automotive business has a $2 billion pipeline and we\u2019ve laid the foundation for the next generation of in-car electronics and advanced driver assistance. GRID our first product obviously in the enterprise desktop is being evaluated at hundreds of sites worldwide. And with that I would like to turn it over to Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well before we turned it over to Colette, let me first make a comment about an organization change. Many of you know that Rob Csongor has been recently assigned by me to head of our automotive business. Rob Csongor was previously your contact along with Chris in IR. I decided to put Rob Csongor in charge of automotive because it is becoming a very large business and very fast growing business and also very important business. in fact, before I tasked Rob to head up Nvidia\u2019s corporate marketing worldwide, Rob started the automotive business and to now that he ran it for several years and now that it is becoming quite a sizable business with great important to us in customers all over the world, I have asked Rob to take range back again and run our automotive business. He will report directly to me with the new automotive group Chris will become the lead of IR and many of you most of you in fact, know Chris very well. In addition to his masterful ability to read I just love to listen to him read, he also is one of the people in the graphics industry with extremely long tenure, he knows this market like the back of his hands, he grew up with this market and to long before he was in IR, he was an product marketing and so he knows this industry very deeply and he knows our company very deeply. I know that many of you have reached out to me and over the years recognized how wonderful it is to work with Chris and I think all of you would be delighted that he is setting up our IR team now. Okay, so with that I\u2019ll hand it over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Chris and Jen-Hsun. hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the quarter and full-year results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1.14 billion up 9% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Revenue results were well above our outlook for the quarter, reflecting stronger than expected growth in GeForce, GTX, desktop and notebook GPU sales. The GPU business revenue was $947 million, up 8% from last quarter and 14% year-over-year. The GPU revenue increased from last quarter led by desktops and notebook GPU sales. On a year-over-year basis, the increase reflected nearly 50% growth in GeForce, GTX, GPU sales as our products were well positioned for the overall gaming market segment demand. Also Quadro workstations grew 4% and Tesla for high performance computing was up more than 20% year-over-year. Customer evaluations of our GPU accelerated Quadro technology GRID continue to grow at a fast pace. The Tegra processor business grew 18% from Q3 to $131 million led by increased volumes for Tegra mobile devices, primarily from Tegra 4 sales to Xiaomi for their M3 smartphones. Tegra infotainment systems for auto increased more than 60% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2014 was $4.13 billion, down 3.5% strengthen our high-end GeForce GPUs, Quadro, Tesla and Tegra for automotive products was partially offset by a decline in the market for desktop PCs and notebooks, which drove a decrease in volumes of our lower priced mainstream GPUs. The transition from Tegra 3 generation to Tegra 4 generation of products also contributed to the decline. For the quarter, GAAP gross margins was 54.1% non-GAAP gross margin was 53.8%. The gross margin percent was slightly below our outlook for the quarter as a mix of Tegra and high margin GPU products was different reflecting the higher than expected revenue. Gross margin continues to reflect the growth in volumes and stable average selling prices of higher margin GeForce, GTX, GPUs and strong sales of Quadro and Tesla. Tegra platforms have lower gross margins than most of our GPUs. so as the mix can fluctuate our gross margin quarter-to-quarter. For the full year, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin reached record highs at 54.9% and 55.1% respectively. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter was $452 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $408 million. Operating expenses came in below our outlook and incorporated leveraged expenses and a slowdown in employee hiring for the quarter. GAAP interest expense for the fourth quarter included an incremental $7 million related to the convertible debt offering, $2 million for the coupon interest and $5 million for the debt discount amortization. We expect ongoing quarterly interest expense related to the convertible debt to be about $11 million for quarter, $4 million of coupon interest and $7 million of debt discount amortization. GAAP net income and EPS for the quarter were $147 million and $0.25 per share, reflecting sequential growth of more than 25% as revenue increased and operating expenses were contained. Now turning to some key balance sheet items, as previously announced, we completed a convertible debt offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 for $1.5 billion with the net proceeds to be used primarily for the repurchase of common stock and quarterly dividend payments. We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $37 million in the fourth quarter and a total of 62 million shares for $887 million for the full fiscal year 2014. More than 10% of our shares outstanding have been repurchased since the beginning of fiscal 2014. Cash dividend paid during the fiscal year totaled $181 million. Total capital return to shareholders in fiscal 2014 was $1.68 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $401 million in the fourth quarter of the full-year and was $835 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $55 million. Capital expenditures were $66 million. In fiscal 2014, we leased and occupied an office building within the boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus and it has balanced the workspace need for our current Santa Clara staff. Given that this additional space meets our present needs, this gives us the opportunity to refine the design for the previously announced new campus building to optimize for functionality and cost. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As you will recall, we provide guidance for just the next quarter out, which we believe is helpful to articulate where future business growth opportunities are. Following the strong revenue results in Q4, our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 is expected to be $1.05 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 54.2% and 54.5% respectively. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $454 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $413 million, nearly flat with the levels of Q4 as we work to optimize and leverage, the level of spend to address our growth initiatives. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter and annual fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. If the U.S., R&D tax credit is renewed, the tax rate is expected to be 16%. As previously announced, our capital return strategy for fiscal year 2015 includes plan to return $1 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and cash dividend. Thus in the first quarter, we intend to continue the repurchase of our outstanding shares. With that, let me turn it back to Chris.\nChris Evenden: That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll answer questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nIan L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So in GeForce, I mean is it possible you\u2019re seeing some strength from console users, switching to PCs there is this ongoing major console transition, not all that compatible, it seems like some of the game pedals, if you listen to game staff might have disappointed?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. I\u2019m not sure about that. But I think the Megatrends associated with gaming is relatively clear now. The PC platform is the only open-platform for gaming and GeForce is obviously, very strong within that. The open-platform allows you to do things to support joiners that are massively online that are free to play that have micro transactions for in-game commerce and because its an open platform its supported in every country, its supported in China, its supported in Russia and we know there are people who love playing games globally. And also because of the global ability to now develop games of different joiners and different cultures, we are seeing that games is a global phenomenon now and so there is a fair number of fundamental dynamics that\u2019s driving PC gaming growth and then the one that you mentioned recently is important as well, its important because for the first time, for the very first time in history the architecture of a game console is exactly the same as the architecture of a PC, although a PC is still more advanced, its more open, its more flexible the game console titles that are developed these AAA titles with such enormous production value the developers can take them the modern \u2013 the state of the art or next generation game consoles at the same do they take at the PCs. And its great for them because there are only a couple of 2 million, 3 million next generation consoles, but there is already a couple of 100 million installed base of PCs and so they protect themselves that way, this generation of transition is really much more friendly to the game developers and as a result its much better for PCs as well.\nIan L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC: And as my follow-up it\u2019s in mobile. So as we look pass Chinese New Year, can you talk about Tegra 4 seasonality and diversification and when we expect Tegra 4 iWin?\nChris Evenden: Well the next catalyst for Tegra driver, growth driver comes from two places, one of them is TK1, Tegra K1. Tegra K1 is the first time that we\u2019ve brought our state of the art GPU architecture to Tegra and it\u2019s such a great discontinuity with a 192 fully programmable processor cores that we decided to rename it to Tegra K1 and to reflect this discontinuity. The other component of Tegra K1 is our 64-bit custom Denver processor, people have been really excited about this processor for some time, because they know what we are building I guess and at this point based on what I know about the market and what is coming Denver is likely to be the most advanced 64-bit ARM processor in the world. And so Tegra K1 will as Chris mentioned earlier start to ramp in the first half and it will ramp further in the second half. So that\u2019s one growth catalyst. The second is T4i and our modem products, devices with modem in it and we are still on track on that, there is nothing new to report today, we have mentioned earlier that late in Q \u2013 late Q1 or early Q2 is when we expect deices to be announced and I\u2019m looking forward to that and it is still on track.. And the third growth catalyst is our automotive business, it has grown to be quite a large business and at a time when the car industry is really going through a renaissance, just as the phone became a smartphone, TVs are becoming Smart TVs, these cars becoming or getting revolutionized by computing technology and we are seeing our application processors being used initially in infotainment. We recently made a big breakthrough and have our processors drive the digital cluster, which for the automotive industry, the cockpit is really important grounds and because it\u2019s so vital to the driver experience, they\u2019re very protective of it. We have demonstrated our graphics technology and our software stack is capable of supporting such mission-critical application, it became a second growth driver for us and now the third, which is using supercomputing technology and the CUDA GPGPU that we invented for autopilot and self-driving cars. And so those are the near-term growth catalysts for the Tegra business and I\u2019m looking forward to that.\nIan L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC: Thanks, again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Wang \u2013 Evercore Partners: Great. Thanks. Hey, Jen-Hsun, I\u2019m just curious when you look at the Tegra integrated SOC side of things, how do you view that, I mean how important is the integrated SOC when you think about or I guess with regards to your vision for Tegra going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hi Patrick. First of all, mobile is more than phones, and that\u2019s just really important to remember and we\u2019re starting to see it now. Mobile is both a device, short for phones it\u2019s also a technology, people kind of gave it name of application processor that\u2019s an SOC built for low power applications and people call that mobile, mobile technology. And so the mobile is more than phones. Tegra is designed with a mobile technology sensibility, but it has an application space that\u2019s more than phones. We\u2019ve only really targeted the superphone segment since the beginning. Our core market, our core targets are tablets, gaming set-top boxes, gaming smart TVs and automotive. Those are really our core target markets for Tegra. And we build the right products for the right time for those markets and that\u2019s really our focus. Maybe, another way of saying it is what is our non-focus and our non-focus is mainstream phones. We\u2019ve always been very clear about that and our focus is plenty of growth opportunity for us and it\u2019s an area where we can add value and where the unique capabilities of our company and now with Tegra K1 where we\u2019ve brought the world\u2019s best GPU, it\u2019s years ahead of the competition to the Tegra market. The Tegra opportunity, so we\u2019re really excited about that.\nPatrick Wang \u2013 Evercore Partners: Got it. That makes sense. My follow-up, I wanted to talk a little bit about GRID, I think it\u2019s probably the business line of yours that\u2019s my favorite one. Can you give us a milestone that we should look forward to over the next couple of quarters here, clearly there\u2019s a lot of demand for virtualizing graphics NVIDIA, but we could just kind of maybe plan a couple of things we should look for? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I appreciate that Patrick; it\u2019s one of my favorites too. And this is an invention that has taken about seven years to do. As you know, revolutionized enterprise computing is very, very hard. The software compatibility challenges, the infrastructure compatibility challenges are truly great and you have to be backwards compatible with since the beginning of time. And GRID, GRID has really achieved some really great milestones and in fact, you\u2019re seeing it all the time now. now internally we are tracking trials, we have several hundred trials around the world, it has grown a lot and it grows every single week, you know that the number of OEMs that are following it and supporting it around the world. Just as it today Vmware and Google announced that there would be streaming desktop applications to devices. You could see that the industry wants to virtualize everything, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize storage, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize networks, we\u2019ve been able to virtualize servers, but we\u2019ve not really been able to virtualize every aspect of desktop computing. And by been with virtualized desktop computing you could put applications of any kind in the cloud and make it available to anybody anywhere and so turning enterprise PC or commercial PC into a service if you will is quite liberating for enterprises around the world. And so I\u2019m quite excited about this and you are seeing milestones being announced all the time and so this is of course a new area for us its taken us several years to get here, but this really Nvidia\u2019s first enterprise computing product and it\u2019s the first products that we\u2019ve ever had the benefit of the global enterprise sales force of large enterprise companies selling on our behalf. So I think this is going to be a big opportunity for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks. Colette I would like to ask about OpEx, I think most of us are expecting inner models for fiscal 2015 a double-digit increase in OpEx, it looks like you have shown some pretty good controls here looking at guidance for the April quarter, could you give us an update kind of on how you think OpEx is going trend for this fiscal year coming?\nColette Kress: So as indicated, at this we are really looking one quarter out and steady as we go, we do take a hard look at this as we did both in Q4 and in Q1 to really start leveraging and thinking about how well we\u2019ve done on the employees that we have hired and how we can utilize them well. So more to come later, but at this time we just have guidance for Q1. Thank you.\nMichael McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Okay and then just one more maybe for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun looking at growth in the your desktop business, it looks like you guys have put a strongest year-over-year growth since fiscal 2008 and I know you have gone through some of the drivers for the gaming market overall. There had been some discussion I think going into the report concerning some shortages that your competitor was experiencing at the high end of the market. I wanted to know how much do you think that benefited growth in fiscal Q4 or do you think it was mostly market driven. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, first of all I guess I\u2019m not sure. On the other hand our growth year-over-year is greater than their market share in that segment of the market and so we must be growing to market maybe that\u2019s the easiest way to think about it and I think for all, for our own sense of purposes the anecdotal evidence is that we are growing the market every market whether its China, the gaming market is growing and its growing in two ways more and more people are playing games, there are more games that are becoming free to play, and even though it\u2019s free to play you still need a gaming PC to enjoy it. and also this quarter, the work that we did with the game developer, the largest game developer in the world Tencent to produce Blade & Soul was a huge success. We found together in China that there is a market for high production value games and so high production value usually translates to requiring a great deal of technology. And so you\u2019re also of course, seeing this last holiday, three very important games, in shop on the PC, many of which are also available on game consoles, because of the dynamic that I mentioned earlier. And people are now talking about 100 brand new games coming out to the new generation of game consoles next year. Next year may very well be the year where we see more high production value games than anytime in history for the PC. And so we\u2019re quite excited about the high-end segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva with Topeka Capital. Please go ahead.\nSuji De Silva \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets: Thanks, guys. Nice job in the quarter. Just a couple of clarification questions on the Tegra 4i. Do you think the superphones will go within modem applications or more integrated, and I know they would be ramping up 64-bit. So I\u2019m curious if kind of the up processor alone is good there in that market. And is the 4i applicable to the other target Tegra market that you described here beyond superphones? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well superphone market is really moving fast. And so integration is sometimes a good thing and integrations sometimes hurt you. It\u2019s just a higher risk to integrate four things that are \u2013 that needs to be state of the art at the same time. And so some companies use things like Tick-Tock to articulate the benefit of strategies and methodologies to reduce your risks. Some companies like us, we call them ping-pong and we try to reduce our risk by moving one piece at a time, so then you can innovative on rhythmic and continuous basis even though the market is moving dramatically. And so integration sometimes helps you, sometimes it doesn\u2019t help you. And it\u2019s just hard to say. Our focus for Tegra is pretty consistent; we care very much about the superphone segment. We care even more about the tablet segment where we can add more value, because we are a performance oriented company, gaming consoles, set-top boxes and of course, automotive where performance and functionality are so important. And so those are really, our target market, some of them can benefit from Tegra 4i, most of them that the large catalyst for our company going with Tegra has always been about bringing our state of the art GPUs to Tegra. And finally, this season, this last quarter, we were able to announce Tegra K1, which has been a huge endeavor of ours and now we not only brought a state of the art GPU to the mobile market, we also unified the architecture in our company. And so the effort of building Tegra is now even more leveraged than even before. And so we used one unified architecture now, one unified software stack, everything is identical. And so it\u2019s very powerful lever for us to expand our GPU market.\nSuji De Silva \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets: Okay, then. For a quick follow-up the gross margin, I know you guys don\u2019t want to guide beyond one quarter, but you\u2019ve done a great job getting gross margin up here. Can you talk about the puts and takes going forward in terms of where gross margin could potentially go and is it really just mix or are there other factors we should be aware of in terms of secular improvements? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yes. let me comment about the gross margin. as you can see, our businesses tend to differ quarter-to-quarter in terms of that mix. I think our ASPs have been extremely solid over a long period of time. And we do expect that to continue, when we think about our high growth businesses, particularly in the professional, the enterprise and the GRID, which have very nice margins above our overall company average and just seen how those play out as they can be influenced by very large deals. as you can see, just finishing the Q4 and our overall GeForce GTX business and it\u2019s a tremendous success, did have a change in terms of our overall gross margins. As I spoke, the overall Tegra business has slightly lower gross margins. so again, depending on the volumes of what percentage that business is of our total will have an influence. But we\u2019re extremely pleased in terms of the progress that we made on gross margins for the full year, fiscal year 2014, I mean worth living and then heading into Q1, I think it looks very solid as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Suji.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim E. Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon and congratulations on strong results. I was wondering if you could maybe address the Tegra business for a moment, can you talk about whether from here, you had expected to decline more or less seasonally than the rest of business in the Q1. and then do you think it\u2019s going to be likely the October quarter that we would see a meaningful pickup by the new generation design wins or do you think it\u2019s \u2013 it is possible it could happen in the July quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Jim first of all, thanks a lot. The growth drivers, the next catalyst for growth for us are the three that I mentioned, Tegra K1 and T4i devices coming to market, and other modem devices coming to market and our automotive business. Those are the three near-term catalysts for growth and they really kick in starting in late Q1, mostly in Q2 and then very largely in Q3. Okay, so but they start kicking in, in late Q1 and in Q2, and very largely in Q3. and so that\u2019s kind of the way to think about it. Overall for our Q1 guidance, seasonality aside we\u2019re growing Q1 year-over-year 10% and so we\u2019re seeing nice growth across the board for the company.\nJim E. Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. I was wondering if you can comment on the \u2013 within the professional space, the Tesla piece in particular obviously, that can be lumpy driven by some specific data center and other large scale deployments. what\u2019s your little visibility on the Tesla piece of business as you have throughout the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, these are \u2013 there is partly supercomputing business and they tend to be lumpy; the second part of it is enterprise business and we tend to have visibility out quite a long time; and the third part of it is really about expanding Tesla into new fields of use, one of the most important commercial large scale simulation software packages in the world is answers fluent. I don\u2019t know how many companies use it, but I surely know we use it and most manufacturing companies in the world use it. And this is a piece of software that is vital to the industrial economy. And finally we\u2019ve been able to accelerate in port Fluent and to CUDA. This is a multi-year effort for us. This was a very, very significant announcement. We are supper, supper excited about it. And so this opens up a new field of use, there are applications like that are cropping out of the wood works all over the place. And the reason for that is because I think that accelerated computing with CUDA hasn\u2019t really reached the tipping point that if no longer, whether this computing model is viable, if no longer whether this computing model is going to be around, those are full grown conclusions. It is now how quickly can I port my application so that I can accelerate it and have a competitive advantage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: Thank you. Just following on from the last question given the comments about some of the Tegra drivers starting here in late Q1; We think that that helps to offset some of the seasonality in the Tegra business such that we take a look at your guidance we should expect the GPU in the Tegra business kind of down in about equal percentage as we look in to the April quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well Chris you know we guide one quarter at a time. And we are quite happy with the guidance that we provided and when Q2 comes along we\u2019ll guide that.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: No, I\u2019m sorry I was referring the first quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: With the first quarter Chris, what Colette just guided? What was the question? Maybe Colette can handle it.\nColette Kress: Yes, so as we look into Q1 the overall revenue guidance is about a 10% over the prior year. We were seeing a definite strength year-over-year particularly in our enterprise business, which we will definitely see will continue. Our GPU in terms of what we have seen in terms of GeForce, but we do expect there is a sequential decline from Q4 in overall desktop and notebook shipments. So, that is baked in there from a sequential standpoint. We will see how the quarter goes in terms of Tegra, we feel pretty solid about the levels that we ended in Q4 and what we see heading into Q1. But that\u2019s all take into account into the guidance was 1050 [ph].\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: All right that\u2019s very helpful and I apologize if I was unclear with the question. Just as I look forward with the buyback that you have right now. Could you clarify where your onshore cash sits now after you have competed the convert?\nColette Kress: The additional net aspect of the convert as we added 1.5 and we are sitting at about the same amount of U.S. cash as we were before, so we are now probably well over the $2 billion level in the U.S. right now as we are entering into Q1.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.\nKevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. In the quarter though you had said Quadro business was down quarter-over-quarter, was that seasonality or was it just that the third quarter was such a strong quarter?\nColette Kress:\n :\nKevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great thanks and just with the follow-up. You had a GPU licensing business open for a while and I just want to know if you\u2019ve got anything in the pipeline or any views you can give us for 2014 on the GPU licensing?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes Kevin. Thanks for the question. You know that NVIDIA is a core technology company and we invented GPU, we invented GPGPU and now we invented for virtualization of GPUs. And our company has over 7,000 patents granted and approved and granted and filed. And so technology licensing is an important part of our company strategy and is a part of strategy that we\u2019ve implemented for some time. These discussions take long time and it\u2019s always unpredictable and we are patient. We know how important GPUs are. We know how many companies in the world now utilize GPUs and we know how fundamental our technology patents are. The question that you asked also includes the fact that we on July I think it was last year, we announced that we would also open up our GPU technology. GPU designs to be incorporated in the products of large third-party vertically integrated companies. And that strategy is very important to us and we are making our latest generation GPUs available to them. And discussions are happening and that will take time. This is not something that happens very quickly because it includes people\u2019s methodologies and designing it into the work flow and so, but we add so much value here. And this is something that I think we have a real great opportunity to find new growth venues for our company.\nKevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot Kevin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:\n. :\n :\n :\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Chris first of all thanks. Well, it depends on whether its percentage or dollars. And if it\u2019s dollars I\u2019d say Tegra is up there. And if it\u2019s percentage GRID is up there. If it\u2019s kind of between percentage and dollars I would say Tesla is up there and because Tesla is already a large business. Tesla and Auto both are large businesses and have large growth opportunities. That\u2019s kind of the way I would do it. And I would say that in terms of dollars, absolute dollars yes, the GTX is up there too. Gaming is up there too. And so it depends on whether we are talking about dollars or percentages.\nChristopher Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, things are pretty good across the board that\u2019s helpful. I guess as a quick follow-up, could you just talk a little more about your long-term expectations for both SHIELD and then products like Tegra K1 is pretty capable, it certainly seems like there are some opportunity to displays console gaming with your noble shifts, just your thoughts long-term there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, well you know that SHIELD is our strategy, its core to our strategy to cultivate to develop gaming on the Android platform we believe that Android is going to be one of the most important computing platforms in the futures, if not already now and its available on every country, it\u2019s available on all kinds of devices and because it\u2019s an open platform allows for open innovation in a lot of industries. Gaming is very important to us where there are high production value in games; there are typically great demand for GPUs, great demand for visual computing expertise like ours. We could add a lot of value in gaming and so the android market has a lot of phone, but it doesn\u2019t have a lot of gaming, genuinely good gaming platforms and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we decided to build SHIELD. The reception of SHIELD is really fantastic, people who have used it love it, I am really delighted by the capabilities of our company to build devices and people who have enjoyed it love the build quality. Our \u2013 but its \u2013 we are modest about the revenues from it, we are modest about its distribution, because it\u2019s something that were still learn, but it\u2019s important to our strategy for gaming and at this point there is more and more and more evidence that gaming is going to be very important for android and I\u2019m delighted that SHIELD has been the spear point if you will that makes great games available on android.\nOperator: Next question comes from line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Please go head\nAmbrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Hi thank you Jen-Hsun. On GRID could you just provide us the frame of reference, so when you started on this endower versus where you are today. Where you \u2013 has it surpassed all your wild expectations in terms of the trails you are having and then more importantly on the revenue side you mentioned percentage wise its going to grow, but just help us understand when does it become a meaningful portion and then just also in terms of size and I\u2019ll restrict my question, just though it\u2019s a multi part question. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hi Ambrish, the market opportunity for GRID is several different applications, probably the single largest application is enterprise virtualization, enterprise virtualization is a major thrust and has been a major thrust in enterprise IT for the last ten years. Not only is it great for productivity, its great for cost effectiveness, so that you can every agree recourses in a data center, it\u2019s great for manageability, it\u2019s great for security and so but there is a one class of computing in all enterprises that has not been able to be virtualized and that\u2019s your desktop PC and all of the application that are associated with it. GRID makes it possible for us to now virtualized desktop PC application and literally stream it to you like we stream Netflix to you and we can stream it you from anywhere. And the wonderful think about GRID is it\u2019s compatible with every and any PC application that we know of and so that\u2019s one application. Another application is cloud gaming, we are delighted that our cloud computing infrastructure is getting more capable, broadband is getting more available, those things are becoming more and more commoditized and overtime it stands to reason we should be able to enjoy even the most heavy PC applications which is games on any device and anywhere you like to enjoy it. And the third, the third has to do with GRID being used for computing in the cloud, it could be used for image processing as more and more videos and images are being uploaded into the cloud our GPUs are incredible at image processing. So when you think about all of these different applications in aggregate, the GPU could be quite a successful processor for data centers and cloud and so in time it will be quite large, but if you look at where it is today its probably a couple of years behind Tesla. If you think about where we are with Tesla a couple of years ago and now it\u2019s a multi $100 million business, it\u2019s a couple of years behind, but at some point both businesses have the opportunity to be very, very large. Its okay?\nAmbrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our data center initiatives.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Ambrish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Hey guys, congrats on the strong results and thanks so much for letting me ask a question. Can you guys talk perhaps about our cash position; you guys had a ton of cash on your balance sheet before the convert. So perhaps there is not too much of a good thing but can you talk about your minimum cash need, why they might be so high and then talk about your appetite or strategy for acquisitions.\nColette Kress: So cash position was influenced a little bit about where that cash was, so our cash position is about the same if you look at it as a net position, after looking at the convertible that we executed in Q4. the convertible was really to take care of the ability to be able to use that cash in the U.S., so we are sitting on the cash in the U.S. with a full plan to return that to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 and beyond both through our share repurchases program as well as also our cash dividends that we have from a quarterly basis. We don\u2019t necessarily comment on our overall cash needs, we don\u2019t really talk about our overall acquisition or if there was an acquisition at this time. So steady as we go, we feel that the $1 billion return to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 is a very, very solid matching number to our fiscal year 2014 and we\u2019ll talk further after we get through the fiscal year.\nChristopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Okay, great just a follow-up there. It kind of seems like maybe you are hinting it maybe something more than $1 billion for 2015, maybe some sort of an acceleration there given the cash and then my actual question is it seems like the sequential revenue drop in 1Q was a little more than many of us has expected. So what is driving the delta there, is it just a function of maybe a weaker than expected PC market and perhaps even sub-seasonal or is there something else going on there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Chris, I\u2019ll let Colette back on and talk about the cash question again. But let me first comment about Q1. First of all, our GPU position is stronger than anytime in our history, whether it\u2019s GeForce for gaming and all of the innovations we have there and all the groundbreaking work that we\u2019re doing there, whether it\u2019s GRID where we invented virtual GPUs and is now strike right in the middle of enterprise virtualization initiatives all over the world to Tesla, which where we invented GPGPU and using our processors for massively parallel computing. Our position and our contributions in visual computing is stronger than ever before. And now, with Tegra K1, we brought that exact same state of the art GPU architecture to mobile. And so our position in GPU is just stronger than ever before. We guided what we guided. In Q1, we\u2019re growing relative to last year, 10% and then we\u2019ll come back and see how it turns out. You have asked a question about acquisition. If you take a look at our company, we were comfortable acquiring, we\u2019re also extremely comfortable innovating. This is one of the most inventive companies I\u2019m sure that you see in technology and we invented some very important and fundamental technologies that influences industries margin wide today. And so we think about R&D and M&A in very similar ways, except unlike many companies we have fundamental ability to be very inventive. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why our R&D budget is a little higher, but in total aggregate, when you think about the investments that we\u2019ve made in aggregate between R&D and M&A, we\u2019re right there with many companies that our ratio for R&D internal, internal R&D of course, is higher, that\u2019s just because we have some of the world\u2019s best in visual computing. We are the best visual computing company ever and the people how love doing this work want to do their lives work here on this platform and so we\u2019re very flexible with that. And then I\u2019ll hand it back to Colette.\nColette Kress: Yes. Regarding the cash of whether or not, we change our plans, given its really early in the fiscal year, I think we\u2019re comfortable with where we stand at $1 billion but Chris we\u2019ll address it again, as the year goes by. Okay?\nChristopher Rolland \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, guys and congrats again.\nColette Kress: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi, thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter and really strong guidance in what is always a seasonally down quarter and there has been a lot of questions about the guidance, so as I\u2019m looking at it, you\u2019ve guided you are going to be down 10%, 6% and given this is always a seasonally weak quarter for entire industry. Is it fair to say as we look at your GPU business, it\u2019s kind of -- going to kind of be down not much more in the lower end of your range of 6%, but given the seasonality of Tegra and the fact that its so tied to the mobile devices anywhere in this as well as new products going to be announced that is going to be greater than the 10%. Is that kind of a fair way for us to look at it? That\u2019s my first question.\nColette Kress: Yes. Hi, Betsy. Thanks for the question, as we look at Q1, again, the changes between those businesses could definitely occur. You are correct to say that seasonally on the GPU business it usually does come down in Q1 associated with the general desktop and or notebooks. So that\u2019s incorporated in there. We still have some high growth businesses. So those have been not necessarily following the seasonal trends, but we do expect that in terms of the GPU business. And then Tegra as we see right now steady as we go. We are not at this time providing very specific guidance on each of those as we have a couple of ranges for each of those businesses as we look at our guidance.\nBetsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks Colette and then my next question Colette is for you on the balance sheet. So you have doing a great job there and especially with the digital inventory continue to go down. So I was wondering if you could remind us what is the healthy levels of days of inventory for you guys. You are at 67 days and is that where you want to run or you want to be lower than that?\nColette Kress: You are correct Betsy that we are at some continued improvement in terms of our overall inventory levels. We watch it quite closely. It really just is a factor of a lot of times in terms of when the availability of our chips are, so we do have to watch that carefully that it may not just always go lower and lower and just based on when we come out with new products, but we are very pleased at least just where this right now and yes we do as the overall finance team watch that quite carefully.\nBetsy Van Hees \u2013 Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Right. Thanks again for letting me ask questions and once again congratulations on a great quarter and guidance.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Betsy.\nColette Kress: Thank you.\nRob Csongor: Thanks everyone. We look forward to talking to you next time on our Q1 earnings call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

NVIDIA\u2019s focus on advancing the GPU and targeting specialty segments of the PC and mobile markets were visual computing matters resulted in revenue growth in line with our outlook and near-record gross margins. A strong PC gaining market together with record Quadro and Tesla results and the new type of revenues from Tegra 4 in new Android devices offset declines in mainstream PC units. While the PC market overall declined 9% year-on-year according to Gartner, NVIDIA\u2019s year-to-date overall GT business is up 4% versus the same time period. PC gaming continues to grow led by PC MMO growth at 14% according to market research firm (indiscernible). PC gaming represents almost 40% of the worldwide gaming market larger than console, phone, tablet, or any other gaming markets. PC gaming is also becoming a huge spectator sport, but more than 8.3 million people watched last year\u2019s League of Legends championship final online, more than the number of people who watched the 2013 Standard Cup hockey final. This quarter, we launched exciting new products to see the demand of PC gamers and spectators alike. We recently unveiled our fastest gaming GPU ever, the GeForce GTX 780 Ti, which this morning received the following assessment from Maximum PC. \u201cThe GTX 780 Ti is just in the league all by itself.\u201d We launched NVIDIA G-SYNC technology, which for the first time enables near-perfect synchronization between the GPU and the display solving the decades old problem of on-screen tearing, stuttering and lag. And we introduced GeForce ShadowPlay, a software platform that lets gamers record stream and share their best gaming moments. Think of it as a DVR and video shaft [ph] for gaming highlights built in to your GeForce computer. The globe of PC gaming has bolstered our GPU gaming revenues despite changes in the PC market. In video GPU gaming revenues are up 6% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. While mobile GPU gaming revenues have doubled the last two years. While we saw declines in our mainstream PC OEM business consistent with the overall market but decline in mainstream units came out of our lowest gross margins products while the stronger gross margin notebook GTX line grew. The result was favorable revenue and gross margin mix with financial performance better than the overall PC market. Quadro posted record revenues and record gross margins driven by strong sales of our new K6000 product. Tesla revenue also hit a new high driven by steadily ramping demand for Tesla product and high performance computer applications particularly for big data analysis. Evidence of increasing industry compute momentum this quarter included an announcement by IBM that they are working accelerating java with CUDA. A recent HPC site survey from the Intersect360 Research Group showed that accelerators are now a 44% of high performance computing sites up from 24% two years ago. 85% of the HPC site using accelerators are using in video Tesla GPUs. Our grid platform which virtualizes graphics by the point of GPUs in the data center to accelerate enterprise power applications continues to gain momentum. With 212 grid customer trials now in progress up from a 150 last quarter. All major server OEMs including Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM and Lenovo are now promoting grid for enterprise PC virtualization. This quarter VMware announced that VMware Horizon View now supports grid enabling graphics acceleration for uses of their virtual desktop environment. GRID this quarter won the Best of Show Judges Choice Award at VMware\u2019s VMworld Conference. And this week Amazon Web Services announced that they are deploying grid serves delivering GPU acceleration to users running graphics intensive applications and games in the cloud. Tegra revenue more than doubled this quarter, Tegra 4 shipped in over 15 different mobile devices including Xiaomi, HP, Microsoft, Asus, Toshiba, Acer, and others. Android devices with Tegra this quarter included Asus\u2019s new 2500 by 1600 transformer convertible tablet, three new HP tablets and new Acer all in one PC, ViewSonic\u2019s new Android intelligent display and a number of Android microgame consoles. Tegra in automotive continues to ramp delivering another record revenue quarter. SHIELD is the ultimate portable game console and continues to garner critical acclaim in revenues. Last week we launched a game string technology which allows screening of GeForce PC games to SHIELD and Gamepad Mapper which allows 100s of android games to take advance of the SHIELD\u2019s physical control. More than 10 worldwide partners had announced Tegra Note products to ship this year and finally Xiaomi the hot smartphone maker from China which recently surpassed Apple\u2019s share in that region launched with a Chinese press has referred to as the fastest super phone in the world. The MI3 super phone powered by Tegra 4. The first 100,000 units sold out in 86 seconds. Subsequent production builds of 200,000 also sold out within minutes. In summary visual computing in gaming, professional graphics, compute and the data center drove solid financial results this quarter despite a changing PC market while positioning us to capitalize on growth opportunities in the coming year. With that I would like to hand the call over to Jen-Hsun. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Rob. Hello everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to introduce Colette Kress who took over the role of the Video CFO in September Colette has nearly 25 years of finance experience at major technology companies. She previously served for three years as Senior Vice President and CFO at Cisco\u2019s Business Technology and Operations Finance Organization where she was responsible for financial strategy, planning, reporting, and business development for all business segments, engineering and operations. Prior to that Colette spent 13 years at Microsoft including four years as CFO of the Server and Tools division and held senior roles in Corporate Planning and Finance. She had also earlier served at Texas Instruments in a variety of finance positions. She is already making a big impact and we are thrilled to have her at NVIDIA. I want to take this opportunity to thank Karen Burns for her tremendous contributions to NVIDIA while acting as our Interim CFO during our search. During her tenure as Interim CFO, NVIDIA\u2019s financial performance grew and prospered highlighted by consistent gross margin growth and the initiation of our capital return programs to shareholders. With a solid foundation provided by Karen and her team, we had the ability to search for the right candidate for this critical position. Karen will continue in her role as Vice President of Finance reporting to Colette. With that, let me turn the call over to NVIDIA\u2019s new Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress. \nColette Kress: Thank you very much, Jen-Hsun Huang. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here. Hello everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A. Overall results for the third quarter were in line with our overall expectation for the quarter as continued demand for high-end desktop GPUs, Tegra, Quadro and Tesla platforms drove our results. Revenue for the quarter was $1.064 billion slightly below or slightly above our outlook and up 8% sequentially. We delivered EPS of $0.20 and on a GAAP basis and $0.26 on a non-GAAP basis. These results compared to Street consensus estimates of $0.19 for GAAP and $0.26 for non-GAAP. Revenue for the quarter reflected solid results in our GPU business. The GPU business grew $18 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter and was down 2% year-over-year. Desktop GeForce GPU revenue grew slightly compared to last quarter due to a stronger mix of the mainstream segment in addition to price repositioning of our high end GeForce product. The year ago quarter the desktop GPU revenue was particularly strong as the increased available supply of Kepler high-end GPUs drove results. Our notebook GPU revenue declined as volumes in our low end networks decreased. However, high end gaming notebooks had strong growth as mentioned earlier. In our gaming segment, inclusive of our GeForce gaming GPUs and high-end notebook GPUs, our revenue has grown 6% year-to-date driven by healthy gaming market. Quadro enterprise revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year setting another record quarter fueled by a strong demand for Kepler-based Quadro products. Our Tesla revenue increased 6% quarter-over-quarter and 43% year-to-date also setting another record quarter has accelerated computing games momentum. Revenue for the Tegra business more than doubled sequentially as our Tegra 4 shipments in mobile storage. Our growth in Tegra including strong revenue from new smartphone releases by Xiaomi and growth in our tablet products across several platforms. Additionally, our Tegra sales benefited from Microsoft Surface 2 shipments and our new and NVIDIA branded shield gaming and entertainment portables. As we move to Q4, we expect our Tegra revenue will further grow compared to Q3 and we continue to ramp these devices into market. And our customers introduced new designs. GAAP gross margins in Q3 were 55.4% and our non-GAAP gross margins were 55.7% influenced by our success in our Tegra processor business revenue for the quarter and by the most recent price changes in our high-end GeForce desktop products. GAAP operating expenses this quarter was $443 million, which was $17 million below our outlook as we worked on optimizing our resources and spending. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $405 million. Moving to Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue to be approximately $1.060 billion about flat with Q3 with continued success in our GPU business offset a decline in mainstream GPUs. We expect strong sequential growth in Tegra. We anticipate GPU business gross margins to remain stable and to experience continued strong growth in Tegra sales. Thus we expect our GAAP gross margins to be approximately 64.2% and non-GAAP gross margins to be approximately 54.5% in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis operating expenses should be about 450 million in the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 should be about 410 million. The slight increase in Q3 reflecting growth in headcount related expenses. The full year should come in slightly over 1.6 billion non-GAAP. Moving to our capital return strategies, our $750 million accelerated stock repurchase was complete on October 22nd with a return of an additional 14.6 million shares. In total we have repurchased 59.5 million shares year-to-date. For the quarter our dividend was 43 million. Year-to-date we have returned to total of $983 million through capital return allocation to shareholders consisting of a 133 million in quarterly dividend payments and 850 million through share repurchases reflecting continued confidence in the company\u2019s outlook and the focus on providing a strong, consistent return to shareholders. We\u2019re pleased to announce a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend from $7.015 per share to $8.015 per share. This dividend increase will be effective in the current Q4 of fiscal year 2014. Our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion of common stock repurchases for total authorization of $1.286 billion available through the end of fiscal year 2016. We plan to continue our capital return to shareholders and with the increase in regular dividends and stock repurchase authorization we\u2019re pleased to announce that we intend to return upto $1 billion of capital to shareholders within fiscal year \u201915. Turning to other balance sheet items, our overall financial position remains very strong. For the quarter we generated $162 million in cash from operations and a $124 million in cash from free cash flows. Year-to-date we have generated 434 million in cash from operations and 246 million in free cash flow. Cash inclusive of marketable securities at the end of the quarter was 3 billion. With that let me turn the call back over to Rob. \nRob Csongor: Thanks Colette. That concludes our prepared remarks. At this time we would like to open up the call to take questions. Again please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Thank you. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Please proceed. \nRomit Shah - Nomura: Jen-Hsun license revenue was 66 million in the quarter; it's still a meaningful portion of operating profit. I know the agreement with Intel is set to expire in 2017 but I was wondering if that still the right way to look at it, should we assume that the revenue stream goes away in 2017 or is it potential for Intel to reup that agreement? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well you know that technology licensing is an important part of our company\u2019s strategy. We licensed our technology to Sony for the PlayStation. We licensed our technology to Intel for their integrated graphics products. In the time that we have done these agreements we have increased our activities around technology licensing. In July as you probably remembered we announced that we would license our GPU core which is at the heart of the Project Logan which is a next generation tablet processor and there is a market that sure is based on the world\u2019s best GPU called Kepler. Our intentions are to continue to invest in technology licensing and make this an important part of our business going forward. So whether it's Intel or others this is an opportunity that\u2019s very important to us. As one of the most important innovators around the GPU and as you know that GPU is more important than ever. The GPU, when we started the industry was available only on PCs and workstations and now it\u2019s available on mobile devices and tablets and cars and cloud and servers. And so this is an area that we are going to continue to invest in and this is an area that we are going to trying to modify in a lot of different ways, because business models change and business models are different in all these different segments. Sometimes, it makes sense for us to sell chips, sometimes it makes sense for us to offer systems and sometimes it makes sense for us to license cores in our technology. And so I think the way you should think about our technology licensing is that Intel is one of the opportunities for us, but this is a much larger opportunity for us than never before. And this is an area that we have a lot of activity area. \nRomit Shah - Nomura: Alright, thanks for the color on that. As a follow up, you mentioned that automotive generated record amount of revenue for that segment could you give us a sense of how big automotive is now as a percentage of Tegra? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say that is totaling about 25% of Tegra and accelerating, but the way to think about automotive is the automotive, the modern car is a connected car and so digital computing matters more than ever. And instead of using traditional mechanical instrumentation, our digital clusters provide them the opportunity to modernize the driving experience. The GPU because of the GPGPU, the programmable GPU inside our processors make possible all kinds of new driver assistance capability, because of computer vision, because of driver assistance, artificial intelligence, type of capabilities, but we make cars safer and we make cars fun to drive. And so from digital clusters to infotainment systems to in the future driver assistance, the car is going to be an opportunity for more than just one GPU. And as we see the success of the Tesla electric car, I think you are going to see more and more car companies follow soon and be much more aggressive in adding mobile computing into the car. This is an area that we have invested quite a lot of effort over the years and our expectation is to see continued success here. The design wins\u2026. \nRomit Shah - Nomura: Alright, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed. \nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James: Thanks and congrats on a good quarter. My first question, Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the Tegra 4i and that roadmap as the certification we see from the sales in the next several quarters and I have a follow up? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks Hans. I appreciate that. Let\u2019s see we have said earlier previously that Tegra 4i projects are in development and that we expect unlikely to be announced in Q1 and ship no later than Q2. I appreciate you asking and we didn\u2019t announce it, but Tegra 4i has now been certified through AT&T. And we are really excited about that. And so we are going to continue to wait to announce the prices, but has some certain type of voice and data. \nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Okay, that\u2019s great to hear. And then as a follow-up, because the Tegra 4i is implementing the software-defined approach in terms of the modem, what do you suppose would be the implications of this type of in the cars compared to some of your potential rivals that are struggling with using this traditional hardware approaches? Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the benefit of software-defined radios is to be able to reuse that processor or maybe different protocols. And if the processor is designed with enough headroom, we will be able to support higher bid leads in an ever changing landscape of protocols. And so if you look at our progress, our progress with respect to getting Tegra 4i certified and the i500 has also by the way been certified for voice and data. Our speed of getting, our share of modem certified certainly is an indication of the flexibility of the SDR. Now one of the historical challenges of SDR is thought to be power consumption but those are not fundamental problems, they are architectural technology challenges and with the right technology and architecture and a lot of great care we have been able to make Tegra 4i and the i500 modems fit within very aggressive and competitive power envelopes and so we\u2019re in pretty great shape there and I\u2019m looking forward to launching cautiously [ph]. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Securities. Please proceed. \nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: I was just wondering for a little bit more color for the fourth quarter, Colette you mentioned a little bit about Tegra being up strongly. On the GPU side can you say again what you expect that to do and anymore color underneath the surface there and on the professional side versus desktop, notebook et cetera would be appreciated. Thank you. \nColette Kress: So we\u2019re indicating in our guidance for Q4 that we will essentially flat in Q4 versus Q3. We did articulate that our Tegra business would be up sequentially so therefore our overall GPU business will be slightly down from Q3 in total. We still believe strong growth in terms of the overall gaming, side of that we will continuously go into Q4 but overall the PC market and our low end PC GPUs are probably expected to continue what we have been seen in Q3. \nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: And can you give any color on within the GPU segment what percent you talk about is gaming? I think you said that overall is up about 6% year-to-date, year-over-year which is impressive growth but just to give us an idea of how much of your GPU segment that represents? \nColette Kress: It represents about 400 give or take on the individual quarter, our overall gaming segment. \nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: And then my last question very quickly. What sort of seasonality should we expect in your Tegra business? I know you have a multitude of things ramping and even with the Tegra 4i coming. How should we think about the launches of new products offsetting seasonality and whatever that seasonality maybe, any color on that will be great and then I\u2019ll go away. Thank you. \nColette Kress: I\u2019m not sure there is a seasonality on the Tegra business that we could point to at this stage. I think it's going to take a little while to better understand that and even all the way through fiscal year \u201915, some us we can add any color at this time in terms of when those volumes each of the designs would come through. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with ABR Investment Strategy. Please proceed. \nJoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy: Just a question about the graphics situation on the Quadro side. You had nice growth last quarter, I\u2019m wondering what you see for an outlook for that product line so longer term and what you think is a positive drivers have been to-date? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Let\u2019s see the Quadro growth drivers are fundamentally related to the fact that more and more companies are using digital design approaches for every aspect of their product design. You know there is so many companies who still use mechanical prototype, actual prototyping and but today unless you know if you really want to be able to stay with the art, create devices that has exquisite as what we see in the marketplace today or it is that you like to do more 3D virtual prototyping. All that is going to require you to invest in designing in 3D. We\u2019re just seeing great and great adoption of 3D design in all aspects of product design. Now the second growth factor has to do with the fact that we\u2019re able to now because of our rendering techniques able to be we\u2019re able to add value to our larger part of their workflow whereas before we were used for design, we\u2019re now used largely \u2013 we are also used largely for style, because our digitalization on rendering is total realistic now. We can capture real materials, some of the results and actually render using computers, the ability to prototype devices that are total realistic. We are also increasingly being used in product lifetime management and so PLM. And that\u2019s just an increase in the number of people inside companies that we need to use 3D access, whether it\u2019s in training or documentation or managing their supply chain, managing their subcontractors, inventory management, parts repairs. So more and more of the entire product lifetime includes 3D, where Quadro could be useful. And then lastly, more and more countries are continuing to adopt manufacturing not just for \u2013 not just in the supply chain level, but at the design level. And so Quadro continues to surprise us with the signs of the overall market. And I think when we innovate and we discover that the market is larger than people had ever expected. \nJoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy: Okay. And so right, all good drivers and in the past you have been talking about Quadro as sort of growing at the rate of GDP and then we saw that very sharp pickup. So I am wondering if you think the increase in sequential growth that we have seen in the last few quarters is sustainable or if we have perhaps obtain a new adoption rate that\u2019s likely to settle down, how do you view this feature in this? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I guess I don\u2019t know that I could be particularly precise about it, but the thing that I do know is our market share in Quadro is very high. I really don\u2019t know of any car company or movie studio or digital broadcast station or oil or gas company that doesn\u2019t use Quadro in a large part of their internal workflow. And so I think that the real opportunity for us is of course continue to expand globally and work with OEMs around the world to see their work stations be adopted by the various industries. That\u2019s a deliberate effort on our part and we have OEM partnerships in every geography to extend their reach and their understanding of workstations in the local industries. And as secondarily to continue to create new ways for workstation to be useful, to more people, to more professionals inside a company expanding our reach of good workflow, in those two dimensions we continue to innovate and then we continue to drive hard, I think we are going to \u2013 we have every opportunity to outgrow the GDP and so we will see how it turns out but that\u2019s our deliberate strategy anyhow. \nJoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy: Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask a question on the gross margin, so this quarter, it looks like a fairly notable decline in the gross margin and I am wondering about the drivers, especially since what you are seeing? And the notebook graphics side you said is decline in your lowest margin business would suggest that the gross margin also be moving higher, so is it the price cuts recently that\u2019s driving those gross margins down this quarter or is it more broadly a shift in mix? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, there is three components that were notable this quarter. We made pricing changes that were planned at the end of the quarter, but it affected our pricing for the entire quarter, that\u2019s one which is our GTX\u2026 \nJoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy: Jen-Hsun, I am talking about the out quarter actually for the January quarter, the decline that we are anticipating I am wondering what\u2019s driving that? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I guess it was number one be Tegra. We are expecting to be successful \u2013 more successful with Tegra and Tegra\u2019s gross margins are below the corporate average and the success there is good. The success there is good and it\u2019s welcomed and so it will have an impact on our gross margins. \nJoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the pricing front, those price cuts that you have sent through just recently, is there any need that you will have at some point to offer rebates to your card partners for them to sell those products they bought GPUs from you at the older prices. I\u2019m wondering if there is any kind of concern that there might be an inventory problem or a rebate that you will need to give the card partners at home [ph]. \nJim Fish: We planned for this move for quite some time and we\u2019ve been thoughtful about this move for quite some time and everything that we have announced and everything that is out in the marketplace has been the planned and with our partners and so I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please proceed. \nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities: Jen-Hsun if I heard you correctly earlier you said that automotive is about 25% of Tegra. Can you give us an idea of percentage exposure perhaps to Windows, to Android, to also Chrome and then maybe can you give us an idea of how you see your Android and even Windows ecosystem expanding beyond tablets here in the HP 21 inch all-in-one a pretty amazing machine, at a pretty amazing price. What\u2019s the outlook there getting beyond phones, beyond tablets with Tegra? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Almost vastly everything else is Android. We have some for WinRT or Surface but our focus is that going forward the vast majority of Windows on ARM will be surface and the vast majority of everything else in Tegra is Android. Now with respect to Android you\u2019re absolutely right, that Android is not just about phones. Android is the most disruptive operating system that we have seen in a few decades, in a couple of decades and this time because of the open source nature of Android it could be adapted to all kinds of devices. You see that all of a sudden not only is Android and smartphones it was in tablets, it's now in all-in-one PCs, I think three all-in-one PCs based on Tegra was announced this last quarter. You\u2019re going to see more of them. It's quite delightful to be able to buy a monitor, bring it home and plug it in and it's already a computer and if you like you could still connect it to HDMI to a PC and use it as PC. You\u2019re going to see Android in all kinds of other computing devices including set top box and others and so Android is probably the most versatile operating system that we have ever known and has the benefit of also being connected to the cloud and so the day that you turn it on it's incredibly useful with all kinds of applications already on it. And so that\u2019s Android. And Chrome we have no exposure to Chrome today, but it's proven to be quite an important operating system. We have known all along that technologically it's incredibly robust, resilient and high quality and now we\u2019re seeing quite strong adoptions all over the world and so this is an area that warrants focus on our part and we will put some energy around it to go see we can make a contribution in this phase as well. \nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities: Two part follow-up if I could Jen-Hsun. \nRob Csongor: I\u2019m sorry, let\u2019s keep it at two if we can all right, let\u2019s keep it two per person we\u2019re starting spread on that. Can we let\u2019s move on to the next caller. Sorry, Alex we will pick it up next time, we will follow-up with you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed. \nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan: Just on the GRID, 2012 weeks [ph] out I think that\u2019s about a 40% increase on the prior quarter. Off that incremental growth what types of customers and applications did you bring on and when you guys expect these trials to start materialize into significant revenues? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We announced GRID, I mean that is it is probably one of the most successful product launches for enterprise that we have ever had and you could argue that this is really the NVIDIA first\u2019s enterprise product because we\u2019re stationed in this sweet spot of enterprise computing, it's a specialized part of enterprise computing and Tesla is for high performance computing which is not in this sweet spot of enterprise computing, this is the first time that we have been in a sweet spot of enterprise computing and had the benefit of the sales force of every major OEM in the world supporting its launch from Cisco to Dell to HP to IBM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, I don\u2019t know any global enterprise IT company who isn\u2019t supporting grid and taking it to market, the type of applications that \u2013 and we have to support the Citrix with VMware, Citrix, we announced in Q2, I think it was and VMware this last quarter. And so we have sales force, we have the largest extended sales force obtaining product that we have ever had. The type of applications that people are using it for are really essentially taking their PC and virtualizing and putting into the datacenter and the power of doing that is now you can access your PC from anywhere on any device. With a Citrix receiver client with a VMware receiver client, you can now have your PC literally anywhere. Now, there are several powerful benefits to that. For the people who are designing and working on large datasets, the benefit is that you move your computer closer to the data. So instead of moving the data to the computer, you are moving the computer to the data. And so for big data problems, large datasets, data or projects where you are collaborating with a whole lot of other people, you now don\u2019t have a whole lot of different copies of the data. You also have the benefit of mobility. People are using more and more mobile devices and people are working from customer sites and working from home or giving demos, the benefit of having mobility is really incredible. So there is a lot of different benefits associated with it. And then now with the cost of storage continuing to reduce and the cost of networking continue to reduce you can now make these virtualized PC environments much more cost effectively. So I think our timing is good. Your question about the options about trial to ramp, these are enterprise trials and my sense is that somewhere six months to nine months is what we are experiencing. And so we will see how it turns out, but the trouble we have going around the world are large important customers who have significant deployment to do as the early response has been really fantastic. \nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan: Thanks for that, Jen-Hsun. And then just a quick housekeeping question, so historically the team has seen about a $25 million, $30 million increase in OpEx in fiscal Q1 due to kind of the fringe benefit step up, is that how we should be thinking about it for Q1 of next year? \nColette Kress: We are not necessarily here to talk about our Q1. In Q1, primarily it\u2019s regarding our payroll taxes that can drive an increase, but this time we are not giving a full look in terms of fiscal year \u201815. \nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Amir with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed. \nDaniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: Yes, thanks a lot. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of questions here. So on the Tegra, what type of milestones should we be looking at here in the next few quarters in terms of really seeing how successful the 4 and 4i is going to be compared to the 3 when that launched and the traction that you had initially with that product? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I would look at several things. I think at this time the strategy that I have laid out for you guys is 4 basically shows several things. One, we believe that Tegra 4, we delayed Tegra 4 so that we could pull in our Logan Project and also our motives. I am delighted with that decision. It put a trough in this year. However, we have bounced out [ph] from that. I think that what you will see is several points. One, there will be more devices ramped with Tegra 4. Tegra 4 should continue to contribute to our momentum recovering in Tegra. You should see that Tegra is adopted in more than just phones, that there will be phones and tablets and other devices, automotive and other devices. And then third and you should see our modems come to market with important devices that I think people will love using and then lastly the gap between Tegra 4 and our next generation processor Project Logan should be a lot shorter than one year. And so I think all of that is on track and we will keep an eye on it. But those will be the major differences between Tegra 4, Tegra 4i and Logan versus Tegra 3. \nDaniel Amir - Lazard Capital Markets: And just one follow-up on the OpEx I know that you\u2019re not giving full of guidance on the next year by just understanding in terms of the Tegra spending I mean how should we be looking at that on a year-over-year because I guess that does have an impact in terms of how we should look at next year's R&D expenses to some extent. Thanks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: In the beginning of the year we said that we are targeting 1.6 billion for our total OpEx for the year and based on what Colette just described we\u2019re right on target on 1.6 billion. If you looked at the growth quarter-to-quarter by and large I think we\u2019re and we have said before that when the pickup in investment to support our modem projects and our modem projects has two different pieces, one piece is data modem which I don't think anyone disputes is important in many of our market segments, nor does anybody particularly concerned that FDR is a great platform for data modem there was a question about a voice modem and we have picked up our investment this quarter as it's too famous [ph]. I think we\u2019re at those levels and when the time comes for Q1 on guidance we will tell sure more but you know we\u2019re invested into the markets that we believe we want to be invested in. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. \nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of Tegra? You got a few different go to market strategies there with your SHIELD and the Note Project. Can you give us an update on how both of those are doing and maybe what percentage of Tegra revs are coming from each? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Tegra Note is a reference platform. Tegra Note is a reference platform, albeit very complete. It has the additional qualities that the software is very polished and that includes features like stylus, the world's first high-performance passive stylus that is unique. It has the world's first always on HDR that is unique, so it has the capabilities that no other tablets have. No other devices have and has the benefit of having software that\u2019s completely polished and refined. But otherwise it's a reference platform and we direct our partners particularly local brand around the world who don't have the ability to invest in building such a great device at the audience at that we partner with to have these devices built. But in the end our business model there is to sell a chip and we partner with local brand (indiscernible) on the world to take these devices to market. With respect to SHIELD it is our initiative to cultivate the gaming marketplace for Android. We believe that Android is going to be a very important platform for gaming in the future and to do so we have to create devices that enable great gaming to happen on Android. Our investment there is modest, our expectations are modest, and our distribution is modest. We built these devices that are in the hands of every developer in the world now. And the reviews have been fantastic and we are going to let the market tell us how they like it and then we will take it from there. And so for Tegra, we know the business model ultimately is to sell chips partnered with partners like we do with GeForce. In the case of SHIELD, it is an NVIDIA branded product, but we are pushing it modestly and carefully. \nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Great. If you could maybe offer us a little bit of insight into the progress you are having with 4i, it\u2019s great to hear that it\u2019s been certified what type of launch and how big a breadth of launch do you expect 4i to have on the business for Tegra? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it\u2019s our first voice modem product. And so my expectations are that the devices will be quite terrific and I think people will be delighted by the OEM that it comes from. It will likely be global, but not U.S. You really need to have CDMA in the U.S. to be successful. And so we are not targeting U.S. with respect to phones, we are targeting outside the U.S. And so let\u2019s go then wait and see until Q2 timeframe \u2013 Q1 timeframe when it gets launched in Q2 timeframe when it gets shipped. But my expectation is that it should be really wonderful. Okay? \nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Great, thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks a lot, Doug. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please proceed. \nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, just on the competitive landscape in the handset market and to a lesser extent the tablet market for Tegra going forward, as you know the competition is intensified from players like Mediatek and Spreadtrum on low end, but also other players and you have kind of seen Broadcom face a lot of challenges trying to break into this market. So I just wonder if you could speak to that a little bit and how do you think about the competitive landscape going forward? Thank you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I appreciate the question Rajv. First of all, Tegra is not just about phones. Although we have found success with (indiscernible) we have found success with others and we participated in building some of the most exciting super phones in the marketplace and we will continue to do that. Tegra is not just about phones. Unlike the companies that use names, NVIDIA\u2019s application processors can be successful and very successful without motives. However, there are many segments of our market going forward where a data modem is important to have. And Icera gives us a platform to build the data modems, which we are very successful at already. I think the risk of our data modem success is not at all a concern. And in fact, we are incredibly proud of the performance of our data modem. It\u2019s a piece of technology and a companion part of our technology offering that\u2019s really important for us to have. If you look at Tegra therefore whether it\u2019s in phones or tablets or cars, setup boxes, gaming devices, all-in-one PCs, home PCs, they all require the same application processor. And so Tegra is more than just phones. And in many of those segments, our data modem is very important to have. And in one segment, a voice modem is very important to have. And so the way to think about our position \u2013 the way to think about our position, you have to think about the whole Android, the whole mobile technology market, you can\u2019t just think about phones, which is very unlikely to companies that you mentioned earlier. They tend to be very phone centric. We are just simply not. Now, I understand that last couple of years that the only conversation has been around phones, but we all know that the conversation around Android is going to expand far beyond phones and this is an area that we can add a lot to the conversation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi. Please proceed. \nUnidentified Analyst: This is (indiscernible) on behalf of Glen Yeung. Another question about automotive perhaps longer term in nature, are you still on track to reach a stated goal of 450 million sales contribution by fiscal \u201916? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re still on in fact doubling that business every year and so the answer to your question is yes. And we continue to capture design wins and computing an automotive is increasing in importance every year. \nUnidentified Analyst: And can you speak on the design wins at automotive OEMs that\u2019s needed to get that current business from 30 million a quarter currently to that 450 million target. \nJen-Hsun Huang: We already have it. You know design wins are shipping as many years as you know in the car. And so it's multi-years, yet to work on a project for couple two, three years before you ship it. So we already have it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. \nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Jen-Hsun how should we conceptually think about videos growth drivers in 2014 if the PC market stays somewhat weak the smartphone market remains embedded and I think you mentioned it could take some time for it to run. So how would you rank order your growth drivers for next year? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say in terms of absolute dollars number one would be Tegra. In terms of so that\u2019s number one, number two would be Tesla. Number three would be PC gaming which is GeForce GTX. Number four although the buildup of potential is likely the greatest with GRID you\u2019re right that is off of a small base today. And so I would say number four to GRID but the following years GRID could very well being the largest growth driver. \nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then maybe as follow-up to Colette your onshore cash is about 600 million, it used to be about 1.5 billion before. I\u2019m wondering what is the minimum that you need to maintain to run the business, and off the quarterly free cash flow that you generate how much is domestic so we can think about what is the coverage of dividends and whatever is left in terms of the buybacks that you\u2019ve announced. \nColette Kress: Yes you\u2019re correct in terms of the amount of cash that we have in the overall U.S. basis which is generally about what we need for our overall dividend. So with our intent going forward to return a bit more to shareholders 1 billion in fiscal year \u201915 that will emphasize that we will come back with the options in terms of how we will do that going forward but at this time we\u2019re not here to really kind of breakdown the cash flow between U.S. base and international base, or those pieces but we will come back to you in about a quarter and give you a little bit more detail on those plan. \nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: But off the quarterly cash flow that you generate Colette just looking at the last four quarters, how much was onshore just as a percentage. Is it 25%, 30% any number would be helpful. Thank you. \nColette Kress: Not something we talk about I think it's something that\u2019s not necessarily overly consistent in terms of every single quarter. So just looking at the last quarter is not necessarily a clear indicator given where our capital expenditures are and/or where some of the new revenue pieces come in. So we will just come back to you in a quarter with a little bit more detail, okay? \nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. \nRob Csongor: Hey, everyone I think we\u2019re out of time. I would like to thank everyone for participating in the call today. We look forward to talking to you next time on our Q4 earnings call. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Karen Burns, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until August 15, 2013, and the webcast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2014.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP in our financial release, which is posted on our website. With that, let's begin. Our focus on visual computing enabled us to write out a rough PC market this quarter and is setting us up for growth in new markets. Revenue came in at the middle of our outlook, driven by strengthened GPU offset by Tegra. PC gaming performed particularly well in reaching our product mix, growing our share of GPU revenue at driving margins to another record high. The PC market is evolving. As entry level laptops face pressure from tablets. Yet sales of specialty PCs like gaming systems and work stations continue to grow. The disparity reflects how consumers use these different classes of PCs. Many consumers look for PC as a general purpose device they can use for browsing, email, social media video. But much of this can be better served by a tablet. In contrast, gamers are preparing their systems for a strong roster of games coming this fall, including blockbuster franchises, such as Call of Duty: Ghosts, Grand Theft Auto V and Assassin's Creed IV. In a similar time, for digital artist and designers, the work station is the tool of their trade. They depend on increasing processing power to deliver results for their clients. And the use of specialty PCs could become even more widespread with a growth of new applications like 3D printing. Open platform such as PC and Android are outgrowing the world gardens of the traditional console market. They benefit from more innovation. Nearly half of the developers surveyed at GDC recently who are working on PC games compared only 11% on Next Gen consoles. PC game revenues are expected to reach around $20 billion annually by 2015, whereas the total for both PlayStations will be less than $10 billion and Xbox is only around half of that. In mobile, games generate 80% of revenues on Google\u2019s marketplace and 2/3s of the time spend on a tablet is spent playing games. It\u2019s this innovation and energy that we\u2019re leveraging with SHIELD. It started shipping July 31st and the critical reception has been excellent. [Xen] should be described as a game geeks stream device, a writer at Forbes got him excited about gaming again and CNET called it a high quality device with stellar performance. Because SHIELD is an open platform, it can access anything available to an android tablet. That means there were literally 100s of 1000s of games available for SHIELD today at launch. It\u2019s a web browser and a way to update Facebook. It excels as a metrics movie player and as an internet radio or Pandora music platform. Thanks to the effort we put into the loud speaker and acoustic design. SHIELD is the best way to play games, android games. And a key element of our strategy to generate a virtual circle in open gaming is linked to GeForce on PCs. So gamers can play PC games from their couch. One day it will be an excellent plat for GRID gaming. We padded with TegraZone, a curated collection of games all tested on Tegra and many of them optimized to Tegra. TegraZone has been installed by the 7.5 million times already and that number increases around 10% a quarter. The model we\u2019re building for games is familiar for music and movies. You can buy a song from Amazon and download it to your device or stream it directly from a service like Spot 5 or even buy it and hosted in the cloud or Google. Similarly, a game you can download games to SHIELD play, play game online and soon stream it from GRID. Our Content GRID helps to develop and differentiate the games in our platforms and this creates synergy across devices. Games optimized for SHIELD will also look like on Tegra 4 devices like the HP SlateBook x2, or the Toshiba Excite Pro, both of which shipped this quarter. Games optimized with GeForce will be excellent context for GRID gaming. In this way SHIELD, GeForce and GRID each benefit the other and gamers benefit from a dynamic ecosystem. Q2 is a trough quarter for Tegra and you will see more Tegra 4 devices, but you will see more Tegra 4 devices launched through the balance of this year. Meanwhile, qualification of our modems both the standalone base band i500 and the integrated application process of Tegra 4i is proceeding as expected. And we\u2019re making steady progress to what certification at a number of carriers. We previewed our next generation mobile processor, Project Logan last month. Logan includes our first mobile Kepler GPU delivering what the technical [press] described as unambiguous mobile GPU leadership. Last thing our GPU cost as we announced this quarter, allows us to generate revenue from markets previously and acceptable, such as vertically integrated smartphone OEMs. The mobile Kepler inside Logan has around three times the performance (indiscernible) of the iPad 4 GPU yet performs like a new desktop part. We showed it running Epic Games next generation game engine on real engine 4 and running Ira (indiscernible) as recently as of the Investor Day in April was restricted to high end gaming PCs. Forbes suggested that in video Logan could be a mobile graphic disruptor (indiscernible) said that if you get a new phone in 2014 with crazy battery life and amazing onscreen performance, the Kepler GPU will be a reason. Other press was similarly enthusiastic. Last year we made the decision to pull in Tegra 4i and Logan. This made a slate to market with Tegra 4. However, with Project Logan we're early and well positioned to capture key design wins. Moving on to our GPU server business, Telsa had an excellent quarter very nearly its best ever. Notably this quarter's revenue was driven by application-based deals. That is customers using off-the-shelf applications are turning to Tesla GPUs to accelerate them. This validates our continued investment in software. For example, last week's acquisition of PGI, the leading developer of (indiscernible) for high performance computing. Also, since this revenue passes through OEMs it requires much less sales and support resources from us and offers a more efficient reach to scale for that business. In professional visualization, Quadro displayed a strong sequential and year-over-year growth. We launched the Quadro K6000 to complete the lineup of Kepler top to bottom. Prospects look good for future growth. 80% of Quadro sales are driven by manufacturing and recent PMI and/or manufacturing data has been very encouraging. GRID is showing increased traction in the ecosystem. We announced this quarter that GRID is now supported natively within XenDesktop 7, so enterprise is considering Citrix virtualized infrastructures can easily also evaluate GPU acceleration. We have over 150 proof-of-concept trails underway and a dozen Citrix of our partners working on active GRID opportunities. I'll focus on gaming visualization and compute generated growth in the turbulent market, leveraging our IP into new markets and applying GPUs to the cloud would accelerate that growth in the future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Chris. Hello, everyone. I want to highlight some key points before we open up for Q&A. Overall results for the second quarter exceeded our original expectations, driven by strong demand and the high end segments of our GPU business across desktop, workstation and server. Gross margins are now in the 56% range with Q2 being the fourth consecutive record quarter. The performance of our GPU business and intense focus on costs delivered EPS of $0.16 on a GAAP basis and $0.23 on a non-GAAP basis. These were $0.04 above consensus estimates of $0.12 for GAAP and $0.19 for non-GAAP. Revenue for the quarter of 977 million was at the midpoint of our outlook. The GPU business was very strong with a 9% increase quarter-over-quarter and 8% over the prior year. Growth was fueled by the release of new Kepler-based GPUs with high end and desktop and with Kepler-based GPUs now available top to bottom for workstation and server. Revenue for the Tegra Processor business was down 49% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. We had expected a drop as discussed last quarter with the ramp down of Tegra 3 products and ahead of Tegra 4 shipments. Nonetheless, we are disappointed with the size of the decline. Due to current dynamics in the mobile space, we believe it will be challenging for Tegra revenue to remain flat year-over-year as originally expected. That said we anticipate Tegra revenue to be up significantly in Q3 from Q2, as we start to ship Tegra 4 base design wins and SHIELD, our NVIDIA branded gaming and entertainment portable. We expect further growth in Q4 as more Tegra 4 OEM products come to market. Our revenue guidance for Q3 reflects these new expectations. We expect revenue to be up approximately 7% from the prior quarter with stable growth in the GPU business and significant growth in Tegra Processor. We again achieved record growth margins this quarter. The large increases you have seen quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year reflect our strong market position in high margin segments of our GPU business, particularly in desktop and workstations. For Q3 we expect gross margins to maintain at current levels. OpEx this quarter of 401 million was below our outlook at 7 million below the midpoint. Some of this investment shifted to Q3. For Q3 we expect OpEx of approximately 460 million for GAAP and 480 million for non-GAAP. Our OpEx investments remained tightly in line to our key growth strategies. For digital computing, we are extending the technical leadership of our GPUS, growing GPU for accelerated computing and engaging the market with our GRID GPU servers for enterprise VDI. GRID servers are in production by Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM. For Tegra [SSV], we are leveraging our core GPU investments to bring our visual computing leadership to industries that are being revolutionized by Android and ARM. We can make a contribution to many applications where a great GPU is desired. To-date, we have established a proven market position for Tegra that we will build on. Largely with Tegra 2 we generated 360 million in revenue in fiscal 2012 from smartphones and tablets alone. Largely with Tegra 3, we grew revenue 50% to 540 million from these devices in fiscal 2013. With Tegra 4, we are expanding our reach to other large markets where visual computing matters, such as auto navigation systems, TV set top boxes and new desktop foreign factors like all-in-one and smart monitors. With non-GAAP OpEx of 797 million in the first half of the year and 418 million expected in Q3, we are tracking at the high end of our full year expectations of approximately 1.6 billion. We aim to reduce this amount as we remain intensely focused on operating costs. Turning to the balance sheet, our overall position remains very strong. In the first half of the fiscal year, we generated 275 million in cash from operations and 122 million in free cash flow. Cash at the end of the quarter was 2.9 billion, a reduction of 778 million from Q1. This relates to our capital return allocation to shareholders of 793 million, consisting of 43 million in dividend payments and 750 million for share repurchases. In Q2 we executed in an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase 750 million of shares. To-date, we have received 40 million shares under this agreement reducing our outstanding common stock. And we expect to receive additional shares when the contract ends in Q3. In addition, year-to-date we have returned $190 million to shareholders including 100 million in share repurchases and 90 million in quarterly dividend payments. With this capital allocation strategy along with our quarterly dividend payments in the second half, we are on track to return capital to shareholders in excess of 1 billion. Thank you. Chris?\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Karen. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Lisa?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Christopher Rolland.\nChris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Hi, guys. How are you? Can you guys talk about initial sales or at least shipments of SHIELD so far? Is it above, below or in line with your estimates? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hi, Chris, yeah thanks a lot. SHIELD is doing great. The early reviews are fantastic. You probably read some of the reviews online, people really love that, it's a well made device, it feels exquisite and the performance is fantastic, it's an open platform and it does all the things that you would expect an Android device to do and more. And people are really loving, playing with the Beta version of our PC streaming and to be able to enjoy GeForce games that looks fantastic on a PC, on a small device like that while you\u2019re sitting on a couch is pretty amazing. Sales have been great. Everything that we shipped so far has sold out and \u2013 but we\u2019re just starting to ramp production, we\u2019ve shipped out to our partners only several thousand units, and so it's still quite early to tell. But we\u2019re expecting to do quite well with SHIELD.\nChris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And also on the Tegra segment, maybe you can give us a little bit more detail there. How should we think about console royalties, I guess Pachinko, Auto versus your regular mobile sort of breakdown and I guess SHIELD is going to be in there too for next quarter; what that might look like this quarter as well as next? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well this was our Tegra trough quarter and we had talked about that before, the transition between Tegra 3 and Tegra 4. Because we pulled in two very important projects Tegra 4i with out integrated 4G modem and Logan which incorporated our mobile Kepler GPU as a result of that Tegra 4 was a little later than our typical cycle. And so we had to gap out and we expected Q2 to be the trough. We expect next quarter to be up substantially and as Karen mentioned earlier however there were some disappointments this year, some projects that we worked on that we had spent a lot of effort on didn\u2019t pan out as we expected and it's relatively well known now but nonetheless it didn\u2019t meet our expectations. But overall I would say that Tegra 4 is going to ramp up very nicely this coming quarter. There is tablets from Asus, Toshiba and HP. There is SHIELD that\u2019s ramping up and there are new devices that are going into production that are quite exciting. I think relative to your other question of auto we had said earlier that auto is about $100 million for the year or so roughly and last year it was 15% we\u2019re expecting next year to be another 100% growth year. Auto as you know the design cycles are quite long and so the product life is also quite long, but it takes some time to ramp up.\nChris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, and just one last thing. You had mentioned something about game console royalties. We\u2019re not accounting for much game console royalties.\nChris Rolland - Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yeah, thanks a lot.\nChris Evenden: Hi, Lisa. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nGabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets: Hi, this is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish, thanks for taking my question. Actually can you give us more details on the licensing initiative for the graphic technology and also when should we expect that to translate into your F revenues and more importantly help us understand the thinking behind that what kind of customer pull were to seeing versus the means to diversify yourself?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. Well we are a specialist in visual computing, this is our core business. And over the years we\u2019ve enhanced and extended our business model from just chips to now chips and systems such as GRID to system components such as GTX cards and Quadro cards and Tesla cards to now including GPU IP, and so we\u2019re an end-to-end provider of GPU technologies to all of the application that relate to visual computing. And the way that we go to market has everything to do with how the customers would enjoy incorporating our technology into their products. In some customers they would like to buy our chip and put it on their own motherboard, with some customers they would like to buy our system components with our software and we integrated into their servers or work stations. Some customers would like to buy in retail adding cards of GeForce and some customers prefer to build their own chips, their own systems and take it to market themselves. And so in those vertically integrated opportunities we\u2019ve historically not had an opportunity to serve them with our technology and now with our mobile Kepler GPU that we revealed at SIGGRAPH it took us some three years to mobilize the worlds most advanced GPU. Now the worlds most advanced GPU is in a mobile format. It's the worlds first CUDA GPGPu available for mobile and it takes a huge advance in energy efficiency. And now with this Kepler GPU we could license our technology in a GPU core format to customers who would like to incorporate it into their own products and address their own vertically integrated market. And so that\u2019s basically the idea.\nGabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. As a follow-up I just want to get an idea as you know two often three major game consoles being launched in the second half of the year, how should we think about the PC gaming business or what's your view on that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well game consoles are fantastic and I am looking forward to buying one myself. But today, just like in movies and music you game on every computing platform. And the fastest growing platforms in the world today are open platforms. PC is the fastest growing and it's now become the largest, some $20 billion worth of global software sales. Obviously China is very, very large, but the United States is large as well, Russia and Korea and you name it. PC gaming has become very large. The business models are vibrant whether it's declare online games, AAA titles or now free to play games. You could see that PC games are just really vibrant. The fastest growing -- so that\u2019s the largest, the fastest growing and now the second largest is mobile. One of the reasons why we really feel that we can make a contribution to mobile is because video games is such a large part of the mobile experience and in fact it's the largest download of the worlds largest digital store Google Play it is \u2013 video games is what people spend the most time actually doing on a tablet and video games and great computer graphics go hand in hand. This is an area where we can add a lot of value. And so these two platforms are the largest and now the fastest growing and I don\u2019t think there is anything that game consoles would do at this point that would disrupt that. People just have too many PCs and there are too many people with tablets and mobile devices and people like to game wherever they happen to be not just while they\u2019re sitting in front of their TV, sitting in front of the family room.\nChris Evenden: Let\u2019s reach our next question please.\nOperator: Yes sir. And our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: We\u2019re going to follow-up on the Tegra revenue, if you could just talk about the delta you\u2019re looking at flat now, it's expected to be down. One, I was wondering if you could sell and if could give any sort of magnitude on how much you expect it to decline now and then, you had some ramps that didn\u2019t pan out in the first half but are you still looking at the same pipeline of that ramping in the second half for you? Thank you \nJen-Hsun Huang:\n.:\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: If you could dial in any, you expected decline, do you have any sort of range that you could provide us to how much it would decline?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Relative to last year?\nKaren Burns: Yeah.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh relative to last year. The decline comes from, so coming into the year we had pretty high expectations on one particular platform and there\u2019s no sense mainly, but it's a very important platform that also derived from it a lot of design wins. And because this particular platform just didn't do as well as we or frankly anybody in the industry had hoped, we don't expect as much returns on that investment as we originally hoped. Our guess is that it's going to be down a couple of $100 million or so, maybe somewhere between $200 million or $300 million overall and we don't expect it in the short term to come back. But not all of the other platforms that we're talking about obviously are not affected by this one, one particular design win and all of its associated design wins.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks for that. And then on the GPU side, you expected growth into Q3. Is that both desktop and notebooks and if you can just talk about the Haswell refresh. Your notebooks were down a little bit in Q2 of the June quarter or the third quarter. If you could talk about, are you expecting to see notebooks see a bit of a rebound with Haswell? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that our notebook was down very, very low single digit year-over-year and was down single digits from Q2 in the last quarter. And so it's slightly down. The overall notebook, PC marketplace of course is not as vibrant as people have hoped. But you know that we're not really in the mainstream PC market, we're really in the specialty PC market whether it's gaming PC or workstation PCs or high performance computing PCs or premium consumer PCs or PCs that are used for video editing and digital content creation, that's primarily our target. The notebook part of it of course, the consumer part of it is not vibrant and we're not expecting it to \u2013 in our guidance we're not expecting the growth [Technical Difficulty] our growth from GPU is primarily attributed to gaming, to workstations, to Quadro, workstation GPU and the Tesla GPU.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: And that's relative to October with that comment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I'm sorry, Blayne\u2026\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: My question was when you look into October, you talked about broad growth, is both desktops and notebooks growing into October?\nKaren Burns: Yeah, that's the quarter for Q3. That's where the growth we're expecting. I think that's your question.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Sorry if I'm being difficult. I'm just trying to figure out \u2013 I think you're answering it, but when you mentioned all the drivers into October, you left notebooks. So I just wanted to clarify do you also expect notebooks to see a bit of rebound into October?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're not expecting much growth from notebook.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Okay, thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks. Lisa?\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Patrick Wang with Evercore.\nUnidentified Analyst: (Indiscernible) for Patrick. Thanks for taking my questions. Speaking on GPU, could you talk about the pricing around GPUs now? And how will share trend in the second half in your view?\nJen-Hsun Huang: ASPs are up but they've been on an upward trend for some time and that's one of the reasons why \u2013 also because they're shifting towards premium products or specialty products like gaming and workstations and high performance computing what we call GeForce, Quadro and Tesla because of the growth of those segments, it improves ASP and it improves gross margins. We haven't seen share movements substantially for some time and we're not expecting much later on this year.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, thanks for that. And then maybe, can you discuss the buyback plan you're looking for in 3Q and 4Q?\nKaren Burns: Well, we haven't announced any new buyback plan but we certainly have a commitment to capital returns for the long term. The contracts that we're under right now does not add until the end of Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Is there any dollar amount we should think about for each quarter?\nKaren Burns: It was an accelerated share repurchase, so we're just waiting for the contract to complete.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Karen, why don't you just tell him what the whole thing is for the year? Maybe he hasn't seen some of the stuff.\nKaren Burns: The 750 million is what we're going to repurchase and the bulk of it, the majority of 40 million shares we have received and we're expecting an incremental amount in Q3. So effectively a share repurchase in Q3 as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Will that be complete in Q3, I guess, is my question?\nKaren Burns: That transaction will be complete in Q3. Any further repurchases we'll announce in Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Dean] calling in for Kevin. Thank you very much for taking my call. Could you provide some extra color on the acceptance and progress in the GRID hardware area? We're seeing a number of software announcements. I was wondering how the hardware maybe coming along in terms of sale and potentials?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, [Dean]. GRID just as a background for everybody, GRID is our data center GPU server initiative and GRID has several attributes. One, of course, could be used to for high performance computing and one could be used for big data analysis whether it's image direct ignition or image processing or audio processing or video processing, you know that more and more people are uploading just an enormous amount of multimedia data onto the web. And the third initiative is enterprise virtualization. And one of the most challenging parts of enterprise virtualization is called VDI. And so these are the major applications of GRID. All of our OEMs have now completed all of their server and data in their certifications and are now in production; Cisco, Dell, HP and IBM. There are trials going around all over the world where we see visibility into some of them and we track about 150 all over the world; in Japan, in Europe, in United States, in China and this quarter we had just started shipping early samples. So we'll see how it turns out. But this is our first true enterprise computing application, our first true enterprise computing product and so we're quite excited about the prospects.\nUnidentified Analyst: If you can't comment on this, is there \u2013 primarily interest in customers building their own hardware or in using the video design or how is the interest shaping up in this area?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are three ways to access GRID. One is buy it from our OEMs and so that's Cisco and Dell and HP and IBM and there's some over \u2013 almost 30 different server platforms that are now available in the marketplace with GPUs in it. The second way is to build their own data centers and they would buy GPUs directly from us. And so these are data centers that \u2013 they're not announced yet, but they're just large data centers that want to build their own data centers. And the third way is for small or medium businesses who would like to build \u2013 who's customers are single application customers or don't have an IT department or not big enough to be served by large IT companies and they'll buy a fully integrated appliance from us. The last which is the GRID VCA appliance is not in volume production yet. It's sampling in North America but the first two are in production.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Dean.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hi, Chris, are you there?\nChris Evenden: Why don\u2019t we go to the next one?\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Hello, can you hear me? Hello.\nChris Evenden: Yes, there we go.\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Sorry about that.\nChris Evenden: Go ahead.\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Just, the first question about OpEx and the, I guess you said that some OpEx was pushed forward into this quarter, but your comments also suggested that the OpEx, I guess you were going to take some actions to reduce the OpEx going forward, could you expand on that a bit?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Actually what Karen said was that we\u2019re going to target the $1.6 billion that we had we said before.\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, so I mean, I guess going forward even as we look over the longer term, I know you\u2019re making a lot of investments in the business at this point, just some general guidance about the level of OpEx spending we should expect going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t think the plan is to reduce OpEx below the current levels. We\u2019re investing in three very, very important initiatives. One is GRID. GRID puts our GPUs and data centers which powers Cloud computing. I can\u2019t imagine a more important initiative. The second is Tegra, which is going after the Android and ARM computing revolution. Computing devices are cropping up everywhere of course it's already -- we know that it disrupted smartphones. It's in the process of disrupting computing with tablets, but it\u2019s disruption will propagate out to consumer electronics to gaming to TVs to automobiles to just about anything with a computing device. And wherever there is a computer there is an opportunity that some of them would require GPUs. And what Tegra is about -- initiative is about is addressing those opportunities. And wherever we can address those opportunities, what Tegra -- the effort of Tegra, the focus of Tegra spins off because of that intense focus on energy efficiency and targeting mobile devices and small computing devices it spins off GPU course that we can now use as core IP. And so our investment is really around these three areas, GRID, Tegra and our core IP initiatives. And I think these are three very large and very important growth initiatives that are very important to investing, and so we\u2019re not expecting to reduce OpEx. What Karen has been saying is that we\u2019re constantly focused on making sure that there are no waste in the company. And we are the largest visual computing company in the world and our investments are leveraged from visual computing and leveraged from our GPUs, but these are still large investments as you know.\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay, great. And as a follow-up I just want to make sure that I understood the comments earlier with regard to the Tegra expectations for the year. I guess or I think what you said was $200 million to $300 million in Tegra revenues overall. If you could just clarify that, make sure that I got it right.\nJen-Hsun Huang: It's actually backwards. I think last year we had done something along the lines of $750 million in Tegra in overall Tegra from smartphones to tablets to automobile to embedded entertainment. Whether it's Windows on ARM -- excuse me Win RT or Android. Okay, so that all of that was under Tegra and last year it was about $750 million. This year we\u2019re expecting it to be somewhat between $200 million to $300 million less than that. And even though the second half is going to be a big increase from the first half we\u2019re not expecting the increase in the second half to make up for the full-year last year. Was that clear, Chris?\nChris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group: [Likely].\nOperator: Okay. And we\u2019re going to move to our next question and that is from Betsy Van Hees with Wedbush Securities.\nBetsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have done a really great job of growing gross margin quarter-over-quarter and then I believe you guided it for 56% in this quarter, are we going to continue to see as we look forward the continued strides in gross margin or are we kind of plateauing out here? That\u2019s my first question, thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hi, Betsy. There are several drivers for gross margins. One is Quadro our professional visualization products is quite rich in gross margins, because it's mostly a software product. Our value proposition in Quadro is very heavily related to all of the middleware and tools and all of the algorithm technologies that we incorporate into software packages all over the world that are processed by Quadro. Tesla is rich in gross margins, because again it's very much a computing platform products, it's not a chip product, and it's about the programming model, it's about the programming language, it's about compilers and tools and libraries and all about although the computation of mathematicians that work with our super computing centers and research centers around the world to solve the worlds most complex science problems. What also helps our gross margin \u2013 drives our gross margins is GRID. GRID again is a heavily software product. The GPU hypervisor, all of the compatibility that\u2019s integrated into all of the hypervisors and to enterprise infrastructures around the world, the value proposition that it delivers it's just very much a software product. And of course in the future if we were successful with our core - GPU core IP strategy that would be a big lift on gross margins. So we have products that are very software intensive, very IP intensive and therefore very margin rich. But we also have OEM products where we have to compete against other chip providers and our margins are much more compressed there. And so it just depends on where, which one of these parts of our businesses grow faster. I am not exactly sure whether I would be happier if the gross margins were to be richer and richer or whether our revenues were to outpace our gross margin growth, but we have the vehicles now from IP to chips to very value rich, software rich system components and systems to be able to drive our growth and yet we can be singularly focused on visual computing. We can be singularly focused and being the world\u2019s best GPU provider and serve these markets that are growing quickly.\nBetsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thanks. And that was very, very helpful. And as we look at the guidance and we look a the GPU business and Tegra in the licensing, is it fair to say that the GPU business is kind of be inline with the mid-point of your guidance and then you\u2019re going to have a significant growth in Tegra and but that\u2019s going to be offset the \u2013 because of some declines in the videogame consoles, is that how we should be looking at the quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think that\u2019s a good approximation. Our GPU product line basically is mid-point of margins and so if you see quarter growth faster than top line, if you see Tegra growth faster in top line, if you see GRID growth faster in top line, then I would expect our gross margins to increase. If you see Tegra growth faster than top line, then you would see our gross margins come under some pressure and if they both grow at similar rates, then our gross margins would stay flat.\nBetsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Okay, thanks. I know I said that was my last question. But I do have one more, and that\u2019s \u2013 I know you guys give forward guidance just the quarter, but as we look at the January quarter, what typical seasonality in the January quarter? I know things have changed a lot in the dynamics of the PC market. But how do you think we should be looking at seasonality for the January quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think there are seasonality factors, but I think that there are product cycle factors that are greater than the seasonality factor. And although -- and don\u2019t take this as a guidance for the January quarter, but we\u2019re just in the process of ramping Tegra 4 into all of the devices that have been announced and devices that have not yet been announced. We're ramping SHIELD and the holiday season of course is a factor there and SHIELD is a brand new product for us. And we're ramping on Logan. And so we were late to market with Tegra 4 and it was a bit of a scramble, but I think the decisions were really, really good. We wanted to bring forward our modem technology so that we can start to engage the market and start the long process of certification. We also wanted to pull forward very importantly our mobile Kepler GPU. It was a three-year endeavor to take the world's most advanced GPU and mobilizing it and the results are just really quite spectacular. It's kind of amazing to see the graphics that you see in a high end PC or even a super computer for that matter running in a little mobile processor. And the architecture and the efficiency is so exquisite that the energy efficiency is really \u2013 really it's a big continuity. We've already demonstrated some three times better energy efficiency and as you know; energy efficiency if in a constrained energy environment like a mobile device, the most energy efficient processor is also the most high performance processor. And so I'm super excited for Logan and now we can get into the marketplace well ahead of the competition. And so those factors along with the work that we're doing in GPUs are likely to play a role and so we'll see how it turns out.\nBetsy Van Hees - Wedbush Securities Inc.: Thanks, Jen-Hsun. I really appreciate it. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, Betsy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the qualification I think Tegra 4, the LTE modem, are you still on track for AT&T qualification by the end of this year. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some help to understand whether you might expect that the Tegra 4 product or the LTE modem might ship on other carriers before AT&T?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see, first of all, our modem qualification comes in two different parts and they're related but not the same. First is the data service which is important for all of our tablet products. And so data modem cert is well ahead of the voice and we're in the process of doing that as we speak. And then there's the [voice] that goes with Tegra 4i. That happens when the certification completes near the end of the year. And so we're not expecting \u2013 the reason why we do AT&T is because it's the most rigorous and if we get through AT&T, you're pretty much set on just about vastly the western world's open markets. So that's the reason why we focus on AT&T first.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, on the gross margins you saw in Q2, was more of the improvements due to the mix up of the Quadro and Kepler businesses or was more of that due to the increase in mix just from your desktop GSU businesses?\nJen-Hsun Huang: All three. Chris mentioned that Tesla had an almost record quarter and most of that was from not one singular supercomputing center installation. It was all from open markets and smaller installations, (indiscernible) purchased around off-the-shelf applications. So there is now just a current of business that appears to have developed around the world and that's really healthy for gross margins. And whenever we do well in gaming, it helps our gross margins. You know that GeForce has two parts. There's the GeForce for OEMs and there is GeForce GTX for gaming. Usually when I say gaming, I just mean GeForce GTX which happens to be most of our \u2013 the upper half of our GeForce business.\nJim Schneider - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: Thank you for taking the question. Jen-Hsun, just to clarify the question that Chris had asked, you had mentioned that you expect operating expense to stay at current levels. When you refer to current levels, were you referring to the levels that you'll be at with fiscal third quarter guidance or levels that you were at with the result that you had in fiscal 2Q?\nJen-Hsun Huang: This coming quarter plus or minus.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: Okay, so annualized if that's where OpEx is, then you'd be on something closer to a 1.84 billion annual OpEx run rate, correct?\nJen-Hsun Huang: No, that's not correct. We \u2013 go ahead, Karen.\nKaren Burns: So I mentioned we were at 700 \u2013 just under 800 million for the first half. And then if you add the 418 guidance and then on a path for Q4 if you do some trajectory small, we're just above 1.6 and it's a classic range of plus or minus 2%.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: Okay, got it. And then switching gears to the products, Jen-Hsun, a lot of discussion on SHIELD as they get started to ramp for revenues. When you look out at the ramps that you have planned for those separate products, when do they start becoming a material relative to total company revenues? For example, when would either of them start to move into that 3% to 5% of company sales range?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would really love to see GRID be able to contribute on a level like Telsa next year. And Telsa contributes materially. I think that SHIELD is just hard to say. We didn't \u2013 we had high expectations from a personal level but we didn't set high expectations from a financial level. We think it's just a really special and quite a distinguished product. And the more people that are playing with it and touching it and holding it and enjoying it, the more they become really passionate around it. It's a little bit like a gaming PC is to a PC. This is a gaming Android device to an Android device. And it's a specialized Android device just as our GeForce PCs are really a specialized PC for gaming. And so I think the logic is relatively similar. We can deploy the company's DNA expertise in graphics and gaming into SHIELD and so people understand it when NVIDIA brings a gaming product to market, they've known and grown up with GeForce for many of our \u2013 I even meet many engineers in NVIDIA who grew up on NVIDIA's GPUs. And they know our gaming brands very well and they know what we can do in this field. So I think it could be a really, really interesting outcome but we're modest with it right and we're just really grateful that everybody loves it so much.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: So with the growth that you're seeing in the\u2026\nChris Evenden: Can we follow up with you afterwards? We've only got a couple of minutes left and let's get one more question in if possible.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: Sure, Chris. Thanks.\nChris Evenden: Go ahead, Lisa.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Thanks very much. Your notebook GPU sequential trend for July and October, is this purely a reflection of the overall notebook market or have you had any significant socket losses that would result in the market numbers showing a falling notebook GPU share in NVIDIA?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our sequential and annual notebook decline is dramatically slower than the overall notebook decline.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And do you expect Tegra 4 sales might ramp to a big equal or greater than Tegra 3 or should we expect a lower crest for Tegra 4?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That's a tough question because of two factors. One factor is, it\u2019s hard to say exactly where SHIELD is going to be and we\u2019re just expecting it \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to be modest at the moment. Two, the separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra 3 or Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 is well over a year. The separation between Tegra 4 and Tegra Next is as you know relatively short, because Logan is already sampling. The sacrifice that we made on Tegra 4 to bring in Logan was really a good decision, because we wanted to introduce the mobile world to the most advanced GPU in the world and what NVIDIA\u2019s core DNA is all about. And it\u2019s a time when the market is really craving a great GPU. The next generation Tegra or Logan has a lot more than a great GPU in it. And there are many other surprises that we\u2019ve in store that I\u2019m just super excited about. But at the very minimum, it contains the most advanced GPU in the world binary compatible, architecturally compatible, but at a power envelope that\u2019s 100 times lower and it\u2019s the most efficient GPU that\u2019s ever been built for mobile and any energy or performance comparison is against anything that\u2019s available around the horizon is just off the charts and so we\u2019re going to take Logan to market as fast as we can. And so those two factors SHIELD and Logan are kind of makes that your question a little hard to answer.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Great.

Our results this quarter came in at the upper end of our guidance, driven by strong sales of higher-end GPU products for PC gaming. We made good progress on our key strategies as the Kepler GPU architecture, which delivers outstanding performance and energy efficiency drove strong GeForce demand with PC gamers and began to flow through our Quadro and Tesla businesses in new products. The PC gaming software market, which is forecasted to grow from $17 billion in 2012 to over $20 billion by 2015 continues to be fueled by new great content. Q1 saw the continued growth of free to play games and the release of three hot titles, Crysis 3, Tomb Raider and BioShock Ultimate. \\ To enable our customers to experience these games at their visual best, we launched, GeForce GTX Titan, our best indicator of future success is customer demand. And, since its launch in February, Titan continues to sell out as fast as it's delivered. It packs it to a quite elegant form factor, 7 billion transistors using the same Kepler architecture that powers the world's fastest supercomputer, the Titan at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Strong press reviews have reinforced the value of Titan. A non-tech described it this way. It's simply in a league of its own right now. Titan delivers the kind of unsparing performance we have come to expect NVIDIA'S most powerful video card. An Euro gamer said, Titan is a unique, remarkable product, a serious statement of intent from NVIDIA on the future of rendering technology. This quarter, we also brought Kepler fully into the enterprise workstation market, launching four new Quadro K series professional graphics products. They deliver up to 50% faster visualization performance and twice the compute horsepower previous generation Quadro products. The Quadro K series is now available from key OEM workstation suppliers, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and Fujitsu and it's supported in key professional software applications. As they rollout this year to customers worldwide, we expect Quadro to drive unprecedented performance and power efficiency for the design, manufacturing and media and entertainment industries. As you know, one of our key strategies is to extend the GPU beyond the PC. At our recent GPU technology conference, we introduce GRID for the enterprise market taking Kepler beyond the PC into the data center. In the short time since we began taking GRID to market this quarter, we've engaged over 100 GRID VGX and GRID VCA trial customers and signed many of the top Adobe, Autodesk and SolidWorks resellers to take GRID VCA to market. The world's first visual computing appliance Nvidia GRID VCA is a powerful GPU-based system. It runs complex applications such as those from Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault Systemes and sends their graphics output over the network to be displayed on a client computer. This remote GPU acceleration gives users the same rich graphics experience they would get more powerful, dedicated workstation under their desk. We believe GRID VCA represent the potential $3 billion market opportunity. With an estimated base of 10 million users of Adobe, Autodesk and SolidWorks software, design, print and other creative businesses can now give their teams access to graphics-intensive applications with uncompromised performance, flexibility, and for the first time ever, mobility. This quarter, we also continued our work to bring world-class visual computing to new mobile computing devices. In a key announcement, we introduced our first integrated Tegra LTE processor. Tegra 4i, which delivers three times higher performance than the competing QUALCOMM S400 solutions. Computer graphics in mobile matters more than ever as evidenced by the growing importance of visual fidelity in the many new phones and tablets launched over the past year. To that end, Tegra 4i has five times the number of GPU cores as Tegra 3, enabling high-quality counsel quality gaming experiences and four-pin ADP HD displays. In addition it integrates and optimized version of NVIDIA i500 software defined radio, 4G CAT 3 and 4 multimode LTE modem. At our Investor Day, you saw Tegra 4i making phone call on AT&T network, streaming high-definition movies across LTE at maximum at maximum 100 megabits per second and running the latest high end android games. We have made significant headway in certifying our lineup of LTE modem based solutions the i500 discrete LTE modem and the single-chip Tegra 4i integrated LTE applications processor. We expect or we continue to expect LTE data certification by early Q3, and Tegra 4i certification in Q4. In addition, this quarter we are working closely with our customers in preparing new Tegra 4 devices for launch in the second half of the year and several will be announced over the coming weeks. looking to the second quarter of fiscal year, we anticipate continued strength in consumer gaming, particularly in the higher-end of our GeForce product line. Quadro and Tesla will benefit as Kepler-based products continue to drive the professional graphics and high-performance computing segments, and our GRID enterprise products will engage the market, where our focus remains on growing our GRID VGX trial customers and ramping channels sales for our GRID VCA product. We anticipate customer announcements of new Tegra 4 devices starting in the second quarter. We look to bringing our Project SHIELD open platform gaming device to market with great anticipation. As we discussed during the recent Investor Day, while the company continues to be very focused on prudent investments leading to profitable growth, it is also committed to regular return of capital to shareholders. Karen will provide an update on this topic in her section. To summarize, our investments in Kepler are opening up new markets. We are driving share among gamers, strengthening our workstation in super computing segments and extending our GPUs in to servers and data centers. As mainstream PCs continue to be disrupted by tablets, we are using Tegra to leverage our world class GPU asset to lead that disruption. With Tegra 4 devices and Tegra 4i certification underway, we are gearing up to return to growth in the second half of the year. With that, let me turn the call over to Karen.\nKaren Burns: Thanks, Rob. Hello everyone. You have my in the CFO commentary. I want to highlight for you some key areas before we take your question. Revenue. First quarter revenue was $955 million at the high end of our outlook. GPU revenue was down 5.6% from Q1 and up 8.1% from a year earlier. By comparison, the consumer PC market declined roughly 15% over the same time period. We believe our outperformance stems from the success of our growth and targeted investment strategies. Rob talked about one of our key target markets for growth, gaming. Revenue from our gaming GPUs was up 24% year-over-year. GTX Titan, our highest performance single GPU was retailed for $1,000 was launched three months ago and continues to sell out as fast as it becomes available. Our investments are directed not only at advancing the GPU but also at extending its reach. Our focus on CUDA and general purpose computing are continuing to gain traction in the market place, as evidenced by our Tesla revenue growth at 55% year-over-year. In the Tegra processor segment, revenue was down 50.5% from the previous quarter and down 22.2% year-over-year. As mentioned on our Q4 earnings call and we iterated it at last month's Analyst Day, we made a strategic decision to push up schedule for Tegra 4 by about a quarter enabling us to pull in the introduction of Tegra 4i, our first mobile processor with an integrated modem. This allowed us to engage the LTE phone market six months earlier with an integrated processor that is significantly differentiated The revenue decline over both periods reflects this impact. Sales volume of Tegra 3 processors declined as customers began to ramp down production of Tegra 3 base mark phones and tablets. We expect this to continue in to the next quarter as customers start to announce Tegra 4 design with further new designs and phone ramp starting in the second half of the year. Our Q2 revenue guidance reflects this, with revenue expected to be up about 2% quarter-over-quarter. We expect the GPU segment to better than that and the Tegra processor segment to be lower due to the volume for Tegra 4, starting in Q3. Gross margins. We achieved record gross margins this quarter, now in the 54% range, up 1.4 percentage points sequentially and up 4.2 percentage points year-over-year. There are always puts and takes but this improvement reflects our richer mix of higher margins products as well as the underlying value of our GPUs in the marketplace and our focus on cost. For Q2, we expect margins to remain within the same 54% range as Q1 with a high mix of our higher margin products. OpEx. OpEx this quarter was in line with our outlook. Our investments support our growth strategies which are, to lead in visual computing, extend the GPU beyond the PC and with Tegra, leverage our visual computing assets into the fast-growing market for new computing devices. For Q2, we expect GAAP OpEx to be approximately $448 million and non-GAAP OpEx to be approximately $408 million. Non-GAAP OpEx excludes, stock-based compensation and certain other charges related to acquisitions and aggregate of approximately $40 million. The increase in our expectations for Q2 OpEx is primarily related to hiring for our strategic initiative, and due to the tape-out and related engineering costs for new products we are bringing up this cohort. We are very focused on managing OpEx. Without the strategic objective of increasing TAM, growing revenue and doing so profitably. For the fiscal year, we expect GAAP OpEx to be approximately $1.76 billion, with non GAAP OpEx of $396 million in Q1 and $408 million in Q2. This results in $804 for the first half of the year, in line with our expectations of approximately $1.6 billion for the year. EPS. GAAP EPS of $0.13 per share and non-GAAP of $0.18 per share was an increase of 30% and 12.5%, respectively over the prior year and above street consensus estimates for GAAP of $0.10 per share. Revenue was certainly a component increasing to 3.2% year-over-year with growth largely attributable to our gross margin improvement demonstrating the underlying lift that is possible in our business. Turning to the balance sheet, our tax position remains very strong. Cash at the end of the quarter was $3.71 billion. We generated $175.7 million in cash from operations and $110 million in free cash flow. As announced at our recent Analyst Day, we plan to return in excess of $1 billion this fiscal year in the form of share repurchases and quarterly dividend payment. During the first quarter, we returned $146.3 million to shareholders by repurchasing 100 million of shares, retiring 8 million of shares and paying 46 for three million of dividends at $0.75 per share. This represents a total return of 188% on GAAP net income and 133% return on free cash flow. As part of this capital return program, NVIDIA plans to continue its quarterly dividend at $0.075 per share and expects to enter into a $750 million structured share repurchase this fiscal year. The broadening of our capital return program underscores our confidence and attraction of our strategies in the market and our long-term cash flow outlook. Returning cash in the form of repurchasing shares also underscores our belief that buying our shares at current prices is an attractive use of capital. As we look beyond the current fiscal year, we expect quarterly dividend to remain a key component of our strategy, which support plans to review annually for potential increases. In addition, we expect to continue to use of share repurchases as a means of capital returned to our shareholders with the amount, a function of certain factors such as market conditions, our share price, level and availability of domestic cash and ability to access our sheer cash in a tax efficient manner among other things. Thank you. Rob?\nRob Csongor: That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.\nGlen Yeung - Citi: Thanks for letting me ask a question. In your prepared CFO commentary online, you talk about Haswell being an impact to notebook strength that we are seeing now. I wonder if you could just elaborate on that as we enter in to July quarter, Haswell had or will be launched sometime in the quarter. Do you expect therefore that that business will improve and how is that that you are out there for the second half of the year?\nRob Csongor: I think Karen's comments were related to the fact that as people gear up for Haswell, they tend to be leaner on inventory. We are expecting to be quite successful on Haswell. We are expecting to gain share on Haswell and continue our leadership in the GPU business.\nGlen Yeung - Citi: Okay, makes sense, well, fair enough. Then leading to several follow-up, I am just trying to get a sense, hated we have had some piece of cake there and in Frodo we are wrong. That the growth in high-end tablets and smartphones may in fact be stronger in the market as they are very low-end. I wonder in the work that you do in the market do you see that and to the extent that you do how do you think NVIDIA serves that market?\nRob Csongor: Did you guys get the first part? Something cut out.\nGlen Yeung - Citi: Sorry, the first part was just referencing the potential that the high-end smartphone and tablet market may be slow and in favor of low end.\nRob Csongor: Well, its slowing but it\u2019s a very large market. So if we were the dominant player in those segments today, then our business would be slower. But we are new entering in these markets. So my sense is that the market is quite large and it gives us a lot of opportunities. I think at the high-end or the midrange or the low-end, Android is really quite disruptive and it is going to continue to become over time. People who enjoy Android phones are you want to enjoy Android tablets and Android this and that. The reason for that is, of course, once you get your content in the cloud and once you have all your applications in the Google Play store, you are going to deploy more of those applications in all of devices that you own. So my sense is that there is still great opportunities to continue to grow the Android market and it is going to reflect the Android phone shares overtime. So my belief is that the opportunities are quite exciting for us still.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Question on the discrete graphics market. If I were to make the assumption that PC's decline over the next few years is it fair to think that the discrete graphics market has peaked and that will also decline from the next year onwards? Because if I look at the last five years, the discrete market has stayed flattish in the $3 billion or so range with periodic share shifts between yourself and ATI. But now as PCs start declining then would the discrete graphics market also start declining substantially?\nRob Csongor: Well first of all, I would correct some assumptions. The discrete GPU market has been growing for us 12% CAGR over the last four or five years. We see no reason why it is going to stop. The reason for that is because we are making the GPU more useful over time. Four years ago no one spoke of using GPUs for general purpose computing. Four years ago no one spoke of using GPUs to accelerate digital content creation applications. Four years ago no one spoke about putting GPUs in servers. Now Cisco, IBM, Dell, HP, all are shipping servers with GPUs inside. They are shipping it for accelerated VDI. They are shipping it for cloud computing. You heard probably from GTC Conference, Shazam and many others are starting to develop their software on GPU, so that they could deal with the Big Data problems that are happening as a result of more and more mobile devices and the use of cloud computing. Four years ago, none of that stuff happened, and I think our investment in making the GPU more flexible and our investment in CUDA has the GPU are really terrific parallel processing device, and so we've expanded the reach of GPUs into non-PC devices. Meanwhile, PC is really one of the most important gaming platforms today. It's one of the most important gaming platforms, because it's open. And if you were developing free to play games where the economics wherein the PC is really a terrific platform to them, there are many markets outside the United States, where the game console was just not as popular for example China, Korea, many of the regions outside of the United States, particularly Asia, which happens to be the fastest growing markets for us. The PC is really the preferred gaming platform and we are seeing a lot of growth there. So, there's a lot of reasons to be enthusiastic about the continued growth of GPUs, and so I would say the assumptions needs to be corrected, number one. Number two, tablets disrupt the PC. It disrupts the PC for casual PC use. You can't really use a tablet to design a car yet, and it really doesn't make sense to use a phone to create a movie. So, there are a lot of productivity and the keyboard is important and large storage is important and a mouse is important and large display is important, so a lot of us the PC continues to be very important and those are not being disrupted really. And, where the [segment] that's being disrupted by the tablet today, we are not really players as you know. The bottom half of the PC market is a non-market for video for a long time. It's clearly going on five, six, seven years, where segments of marketplace and that's the reason why we invested in Tegra, so that we could participate in these new computing devices disrupting the entry level PC, a great tablet is surely better than a GTC.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Very helpful. As my follow-up, Jen-Hsun, just wanted to get your perspective on the competitive landscape in both, 4G LTE and high end processors. I think previously you made the comparison that Qualcomm's S400, I believe. How do you think your products compared to the S600, S800 and especially as I look forward a number of ARMs partners are coming out, but Cortex-A15 products using big little architectures et cetera, how do you see this playing out and what do you think your competitive differentiators will be in this market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We see the phone market and the rest of the new computing devices market to be very different. Let me talk about the phone market first. The high-end phone market is dominated really by two players [Samsung, and both of them have their own application processors. We do not really think that we could add a whole lot of value there, and so our target is the next segment down. We believe that we can add value to the phone market by building an application processor that has the features and capability of a super phone, but the price of the mainstream phone, and that's the reason why we targeted the segment that is currently Snapdragon 400. From that perspective you could see that Tegra 4i is incredibly well positioned. It brings a level of capabilities and features of performance that that segment has just never seen. And, we launched it early in the year, a couple of months ago. We see a lot of excitement, we have customer projects going now and hopefully we can we can get to market as soon as possible. We pulled in the Tegra 4i by about six months. That was a decision that we made we felt that it was good for us to engage the LTE as soon as possible. This is a market that's still doubling everywhere. The sooner we engage, the better off we are going to be and so that's the phone market. Outside of the phone market, it is fair to say that you would recognize this as well that there is a lot of licensees of ARM, something like 80 licensees of ARM. I don\u2019t even know who isn\u2019t a licensee of ARM. Maybe that\u2019s a good way of saying it. But yes, there aren\u2019t that many people that are contenders for the performance segment. Tegra 2 was the highest, was the world's first dual core. Tegra 3 was the world's first quad core with a 4+1 architecture and Tegra 4 is the highest performance application processor in the marketplace today. So my sense is that performance is a combination of architecture. Obviously the ARM processor makes a big difference. Your GPU, your system architecture and also, of course, the software. That\u2019s an area that we can add a lot of value to. Outside of phones, where these new computing devices are becoming increasingly, like your entry-level personal computer, performance matters. This is an area we can add a lot of value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities.\nRomit Shah - Nomura Securities: Hi, Jen-Hsun, just on Tegra and my question is, what sort of trajectory should we expect for the back half of the year. I think you said previously that for the full year, you guys are targeting a flattish number. From your sense, is that still a realistic target?\nJen-Hsun Huang: That\u2019s what we are expecting. If you look at last year, Tegra 3 has, truly, a couple of high-profile devices. Those have a lifetime in the marketplace of about a year. Because we decided to pull in Tegra 4i by six months, as a result we slipped out. Tegra 4 by about three months, we are going to have a trough in Q2 this year. The Tegra 4 is a great device. It\u2019s a processor. This time around, although we have fewer phones, fewer high-profile phones, there more Android devices being built around the world than you could imagine. There is all kinds of new types of devices coming to market. We have tablets, obviously in development. We have other types of computing devices that we will also announced probably starting in the Q2 and ramping strongly in Q3 and Q4. But one of the areas that is becoming more common is our automotive business. It doubles every year. It is going to double this year again. It will continue to double with the current design wins that we have in FY16, it should peak at about $450 million and so. So this is an important business for us. We are just becoming more diversified in our Tegra business.\nRomit Shah - Nomura Securities: Okay, that\u2019s great. Great job on gross margins. As Tegra ramps as a percentage of the business over the course of the year, how might that influence gross margins?\nJen-Hsun Huang: On balance, Tegra is lower than 54%. However GRID and Tesla are much higher than 54%. So the two of them are both going to grow. We will see how it shakes out. Hopefully they both grow, really best, and then the gross margins would just be where the gross margins aren\u2019t.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Thank you very much. Could you give us any feel for the relative proportions of GPU, you revenues in desktops versus notebooks? Given the trend you are seeing, do you expect desktops to grow faster than notebooks or vice versa over the next few years for you?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, desktop includes workstations, desktop includes gaming, and then of course, discrete graphics also includes data centers, include servers, includes supercomputers and then there is notebook. So, did you want me to compare notebook versus all of the other discrete GPU or specifically notebook versus low-end desktop.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Yes.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I mean, the low end desktop business is not very large to start.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Well, I am talking about desktops for personal use, right? Individuals buying desktops for gaming and other things.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, gaming PCs are still growing. Notebooks is now about flattish, and so I would expect notebook, gaming PCs that continue to grow.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: So, your revenues into GPU revenues into gaming PCs, you would expect to outstrip GPU revenues into notebook for next few years?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would think so.\nDavid Wong - Wells Fargo: Can you give us GPU for the relative\u2026\nJen-Hsun Huang: The notebook market in general is flattish, right? The high end notebook market is about flattish. The overall notebook market is declining some, but that's because the low part of the notebook market which we don't participate in is being disrupted by tablets, but we are not in that market anyways. And you could argue that that the more disruptive tablets are of the low-end PC market, the better off it is for us, and I think it is. More people enjoy tablets, the better off it is. People who build these high-end gaming PCs and people how are enthusiasts and who enjoy having the most performance on the desktop or people who are building these PCs for their own video editing, you know, hobbies or the makers, people who are for designing 3-D objects and then printing it at home, they print their own jewelry, they print their own I don't know what telephones, they need to be designing 3D somehow and those PCs tend to have GPUs inside. And that's a movement that's really growing fast. So, I would say that desktop PC market that we target, that we serve, is quite vibrant market.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: Peter sitting in for Hans. Just a clarification question on a certification timeline for Tegra 4i. Is that just with one U.S. carrier or is there a broader certification?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it tends to be broader, but you really should start with AT&T, because if you get certified at AT&T, you are pretty much certifying a superset for just about every country. If you are good at AT&T, you are pretty good in Italy or Turkey or larger global markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. As a follow-up, can you talk about the Q2 guidance and what areas of the GPU business you expect growth potential?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We said that I think the first question was related to notebook. Notebook is likely to be slightly down as people are cautious second half. (Inaudible) want to be quite vibrant around quite seasonal, but other than that everything else is growing, but overall I think the GPU marketplace, our GPU business is going gross 7% sequentially.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Why don't you just talk a little bit going back to your earlier question about share on (Inaudible) market share on Haswell? You had talked about your expectations picture and Haswell. If we just look at your Q1 results and kind of compare it to your competitor, it does look like, but looking at the numbers that you did some share in Q1 for the first time in quite a while in the traditional GPU market. So, I just wanted to understand. I understand it's one quarter, but what happened in the quarter. Then kind of looking forward more importantly what's giving you the confidence that to take some share back from your competitor both, in desktop and/or notebook?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, in notebook, you have a pretty good sense of your share because of design wins. Our share could fluctuate a little bit depending on sell-in versus sell-out of notebooks and when the Mercury Research takes the poll, takes the snapshot but that\u2019s one factor. The other factor, is it Intel versus AMD loses share. On balance, our share is higher on Intel than it is on AMD. As you could imagine. AMD CPUs. So if Intel were to lose share to AMD, it affect our share but so long as Intel share relative to AMD is stable or eventually were to gain share then our share would reflect that.\nRob Csongor: Hi, Mike, this is Rob. When you said that you saw numbers that saw the change in share, what numbers are you referring to, the Mercury numbers are not as far as I know, right?\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: I am just looking at your competitor's results in Q1 for sequential growth energy key business comparing it to the high single digit decline you saw in your April quarter. understanding that there is a time gap there in terms of one being off versus one being countable.\nRob Csongor: Okay.\nJen-Hsun Huang: There is nothing that says we are losing shares.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, well, anyway, the Mercury data will be out soon.\nRob Csongor: They will be out soon. Lets wait for that.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, fair enough. Then on the Tegra business, how much of that $103 million, if you can provide it, was traditional mobile, I guess wireless are the $103 million?\nRob Csongor: I am sorry.\nKaren Burns: How much of Tegra is?\nRob Csongor: If you know the answer, go ahead and answer it.\nKaren Burns: Okay, sure. Well, just to explain the point, our Tegra processor is going into many different devices. You are going to see that go into auto and smartphones and tablets. So you really should think about the whole Tegra processor segment we shifted it that way so you could clearly see what our processor, the SoC is doing in the market. Now, we shave some residual GPU related businesses with consoles, semiconsoles, but that\u2019s really winding down. Then there is some embedded, the same thing, that pretty much stays pretty stable right now until again we will take our Tegra processor and put it into embedded products. So my preference is for you to look at Tegra processor as a whole as where we are going to with our actual device, the processor itself.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Fair to assume though that a majority is till the mobile business though, I guess?\nKaren Burns: Absolutely. Yes. If you consider mobile to be smartphone and tablet, yes. We look at it as broader. The car is the biggest mobile device.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, understood. Then just a clarification on one last thing. It said $1.6 billion for OpEx. That\u2019s a non-GAAP number. So would the GAAP number be closer to $1.75 billion? What would the GAAP number?\nKaren Burns: Actually, that\u2019s exactly right. I said $1.76 billion for GAAP.\nMike McConnell - Pacific Crest Securities: I missed that. Okay, thank you.\nKaren Burns: No problem.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nCraig Ellis - B. Riley: Thanks for taking the question. Nice job on the gross margins in the quarter and outlook. Jen-Hsun, maybe a more forward-looking view at the market share question in notebooks you said, that you expect to gain share in Haswell. I think last year through the year you had a nice tick up in share in the back-to-school season. You saw another nice tick up in share on the notebook side in the holiday selling season. Is that the pattern you expect this year or said differently, where and when do you see that share gain coming in this year in that business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, probably not as big of a change this year. If you look at it this way, first suppose Intel was 80% of the market and AMD was 20% and almost a few platforms are really opportunities for us. On Intel platforms out of the 80% if we were to have the vast majority of that 80% of that that result a market share some 64% overall and so that tells you something about our market share. On the Intel platforms we are quite successful. On the AMD platforms there's not really opportunities for us. If AMD were to gain share by 5%, we'll pick up a little bit. If AMD loses share, or Intel loses share, we would lose overall share. So, at this point I think that our market share on notebooks is relatively stable you could be from season-to-season, depend on model-to-model, OEMs to OEMS We may win or lose a little bit, but I think overall that's just not a factor in our overall business that much anymore. We are going to keep working hard to gain share there and but if you look at our growth prospects of gaming PC is very important. The workstation marketplace as the industries around the world are due to develop and as more economies become a design economy is just a manufacturing economy. Our workstation business continues to grow. More and more people are using and creating with digital content, and when they create the digital content it helps our workstation business and then all of our GRID initiatives to take integrate into accelerated the VDI accelerating Citrix applications will accelerate VMware applications you to GRID in the cloud to grouping for high performance for cloud computing dealing with big data. That's really where the really exciting GPU growth opportunities are. That's helpful. Then to follow-up on that point, as you look at GRID and as you look at SHIELD are you a point where you can quantify but the contribution of those two businesses would be for the business this year, and if not when do you think will you get there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: For GRID and SHIELD, I am really hopeful that at the end of the year as we look back, and we are done with this fiscal year, we look back that both of them contributed to our earnings.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRaji Gill - Needham & Company: A question on GRID. You talked Tegra troughing in second quarter mainly because of the transition to 4i, was there inventory correction also contributing to that trial for marketing loss which contributed to massive decline in and then also declining again in Q2 of it base.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, last year had a trough in Q2. This year, we are going to have our trough in Q2. The overall market is doing quite well, so if we had a trough, we must have lost share and we lose share momentarily in our trough, and then when we go back, we are going to gain share. We are still a relatively small player in the overall mobile space. Our position is becoming more and more clear to people. The partners that we've worked with are enthusiastic about the products that we are building, but we have the trough because we decided to pull in Tegra 4i, and we pulled in Tegra 4i by about six months. And as a result, we weren't able to hold on to our schedule of Tegra 4. And, so Tegra 4, instead of ramping in Q2 like Tegra 3 ramp in Q2 last year, Tegra 4 is going to ramp in Q3.\nRaji Gill - Needham & Company: Right. Understand. And, as we go into the second half for Tegra, excluding GRID and excluding SHIELD, but just looking at the Tegra business exclusively, because you are lumping everything in Tegra now. How many design wins do you have on Tegra 4i. That would kind of give you some confidence that you are starting to penetrate and I would assume that will be on the handset side. And along those lines, I mean, I guess, the competitive landscape is more intense was say two years ago, particularly in China with MediaTek and Spreadtrum. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about where you could grow and enhance that? I know you talked about where Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 plays into but if you could elaborate on that that would be great. Thanks a lot, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. That was a whole lot of questions lumped into one and I am just teasing to part real quick. Number one, GRID is not lumped in to Tegra. GRID is part of GPUs. So that\u2019s just the first clarification. Tegra is are new computing devices business. It includes phones. It includes tablets. It includes everything Android. It includes automotive. It includes SHIELD. Because Tegra is a chip. Its not a business. We lumped it all together for the simplicity of understanding. Because we highly leverage everything. These mobile devices are becoming, these new computing devices are becoming more and more similar. They all have ARM CPUs. They all have Android. They all have Wi-Fi and 4G and USB and HDMI. All these things that are kind of becoming universal computing platforms, whether it is a car or television or tablet it is becoming very similar. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Android is becoming so successful. It really embodies all of the spirit of Linux. It is open. And if you want to be an Android device, devices like Tegra are going to be quite useful. So we lump all that together for simplicity. In the case of phones, in the case of Tegra there are two devices that we are selling now. There is Tegra 4 and then there is Tegra 4i. Tegra 4 is the high-end processor. Tegra 4i has an integrated modem. Tegra 4i is much more targeted at phones. Tegra 4 is much more targeted at tablets, set-top boxes, cars, clamshell devices, et cetera. So we have a lot more Tegra 4 design wins than we have Tegra 4i because we just announced Tegra 4i. We pulled it in by six months surprised the customers and we surprised the market which is all good and I was talking about the positioning of Tegra 4i earlier that was really targeted at the mainstream with superphone features. We have customer projects ongoing now and our expectation is that the design cycle would take about nine months to about a year, which is relatively typical for phones. So we announced it in Q1. My expectation is that we would have phones completed in late Q4 and then be in production hopefully be in shells by Q1 of next year. Tegra 4 tablets and clamshells and TVs and set-top boxes and that kind of stuff, cars and that kind of stuff, we hope our customers announce devices in late Q2 and we would like to be ramping quite hard by Q3 effect. I hope that clarifies it for you.\nRaji Gill - Needham & Company: No, it does. I appreciate that but just to make sure, so 4i, you are really not going to see much revenue until obviously in to Q1 of next year. So the Tegra revenue that\u2019s going to be ramping in the second half are really going to come from either SHIELD or Tegra 4 in tablets or automotive or whatever it is.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Mostly, yes. Mostly Tegra 4 in tablets, in auto or in SHIELD or a set-top box. Right.\nOperator: Your next audio question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: The gross margins is an area where you have done very, very over the past couple of years and I wanted to ask relative to the Q1 and Q2, can you break apart for us, how much of the improvement was due to the enterprise mix. In other words, Quadro and Tesla and things like that, and how much of that was mix in the core gaming and other GPU business? And, why do you think that mix in the core gaming part of the business is the same boy as we go in the back half of the year.\nRob Csongor: Let me break it down this way. So, whenever our gaming business improves it helps gross margins. Whenever GTX improves, it helps gross margins. When Tesla grows it helps gross margins. When Quadro grows it helps gross margins relative to the corporate average. I am talking about relative to corporate average. When GRID grows it helps relative to gross margins. When notebook obviously drag the gross margins, because they tend to be more competitive business. Low end desktop PC business tends to drag gross margins, but that's not a very large business anyhow. Okay. So, you just think about it at the highest levels simplistically like that, every quarter is of course a little bit different, but if you simplistically think of it that way that GRID, Tesla, Quadro and GTX are good promotions, improving those business are good promotions.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Fair enough. And, then just as a follow-up. Is there any way, this time another market sizing or opportunity sizing thing. For this can you talked about roughly what contribute you expect from your non-traditional enterprise business that things like Tesla, Things like GRID for enterprise you have it know any commentary there would be helpful seems enterprise is outside Quadro.\nRob Csongor: I believe that the vast majority comes outside of Quadro. Quadro is stable and slightly growing, but the growing, the really significant growth should be coming out of Tesla and GRID. That's for enterprise.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Any sense of how big it would be in absolute dollar terms?\nRob Csongor: I would guess several hundred million dollars year-over-year.\nJames Schneider - Goldman Sachs: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nRob Csongor: I think, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your last audio question comes from line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: Back on the gross margin subject, good job there. I was just curious what went better than expected in the quarter relative when you came into the quarter was a pricing advantage to get some unexpected cost reduction? What were some of the moving parts versus what you expected?\nRob Csongor: You know, the PC market declined 10% quarter-over-quarter, but we declined only 6% quarter-over-quarter, and that difference comes from growth in the non-commodity PC space of course and wherever that growth is that's non-commodity PC space will tend to be Tesla and Quadro and GTX and those growth are always good for us and that helps gross margins. That's also we are putting most of our energy. Most of our energy related to GPGPU, related to extending our GPU beyond the PC into our data centers and servers all the work that has led to the announcement of Cisco, and IBM, and Dell and HP launching their GPU servers, all of that kind of growth is good and I think we are just gearing up for GRID becoming a larger and larger component of our business and that's good for our margins.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: I see. And, on pricing for your notebook GPUs and your desktop GPUs, do those did your pricing increase sequentially?\nRob Csongor: No. Those kind of pricing is known quite long ago, right? We get design wins six months, nine months for the fourth quarter. And so those kind of pricing actions were done long ago.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: Okay. Well, going into the Q2. I think you said you expected the notebooks to be down sequentially, is that right? Notebook GPU?\nRob Csongor: Yes.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: Okay. So, if I am doing the math right, then I am seeing double-digit increases in workstation, Tesla and/or your desktop business. Can you help me understand what's going to drive the big growth you are expecting in the other parts the GPU business for Q2?\nRob Csongor: Karen, do you want to answer that?\nKaren Burns: Sure. Desktop, GPU, GTX is probably one of the biggest drivers.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: And what is that? Is there something that you are expecting in terms of new games driving demand or what's the driver of it?\nKaren Burns: We would like to wait to tell you about that.\nRob Csongor: Shawn. Give us 90 days. We will come back and report on that.\nShawn Webster - Macquarie: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.\nRob Csongor: Okay. Thank you. All right, I think that\u2019s all we have time for today. Thanks very much, everyone. Look forward to talking you next time at our Q2 earnings call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

My name is George, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 11, 2015. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with NVIDIA. Ms. Kress, you may begin your conference.\nColette M. Kress: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2015. With us on the call today from NVIDIA is Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer. I'd also like to introduce Arnab Chanda, who joined us last week, as the Head of Investor Relations. Arnab and Raj will closely work to support the investment community. I'd like to remind you, today's call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It is also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until February 18, 2015. The webcast will be available for replay up until the next quarter's conference call to discuss Q1 financial results. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It cannot be reproduced or transcribed without our written prior consent. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our statements are based as of today, February 11, 2015, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You may find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let's start. We achieved record revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year, with impressive growth in each of our markets' specialized platforms. NVIDIA's strategy of creating an ecosystem in gaming, enterprise graphics, accelerated computing and automotive continues to make excellent headway. Our gaming platforms grew more than 30% year-on-year and accelerated in the fourth quarter, driven by our 10th-generation Maxwell processors and the vibrant gaming market. Launched in September, our GeForce GTX 980 and 970 GPUs continue to be enthusiastically received. The Maxwell architecture provides new capabilities such as real-time, dynamic, global illumination, which simulates the true interaction of light with the environment and is the most energy-efficient GPU architecture ever created. We added to our lineup the GTX 960, which brings Maxwell to $199, what we see as the gaming market sweet spot. Powered by 1,024 CUDA Cores, it plays even some of the most demanding titles on 60 frames per second on full HD displays and it leaves plenty of headroom for over-clockers. The GTX 960 will let gamers enjoy the latest games at quality and performance greater than even the best gaming consoles at half the price. There are now more than 50 million PCs with GeForce Experience, our application for the gaming ecosystem that optimizes the user settings for each title and enables players to record and share their victories. In the month of November alone, GeForce Experience users downloaded our drivers over 30 million times. GeForce Experience brings the simplicity and the community benefits of the console to the PC. NVIDIA powered the holiday season's 2 best-reviewed Android tablets, the Google Nexus 9 and our own SHIELD Tablet, which are based on our Tegra K1 processor. More than a dozen media outlets recommended SHIELD in their holiday gift giving guides. Over the course of the quarter, SHIELD, which has pioneered a premium gaming experience for tablets, became one of the very first devices to be upgraded to the Google's latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. The NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to gain momentum. More than 300 companies worldwide tested the product in recent months and experienced the benefits of GPU-accelerated virtualization. They range from large institutions such as the University of Southern California, leading manufacturers such as Airbus and Lockheed Martin and defense proprietors like Raytheon. Enterprise virtualization leaders continue to deploy GRID. Just last week, VMware rolled out the latest version of its vSphere virtualization software, including full support for our GRID vGPU graphics virtualization technology. Quadro professional graphics continue to maintain market leadership. Refreshed in Q3, the lineup is now being shipped in all major OEMs. For the sixth year in a row, every film nominated for an Academy Award for special effects was made using Quadro. Our accelerated computing platform performed very strongly. Tesla's revenue growth from a year ago exceeded 50%, as HPC customers and cloud service providers continue to deploy large GPU-powered systems. These provide deep learning capabilities that help enable our amazing capabilities, like voice recognition and natural language processing. Using Tesla, our customers have seen dramatic benefits in application performance, radically reducing run times. During the quarter, we introduced the Tesla K80 Dual-GPU, our new flagship Tesla offering. It provides nearly twice the performance and double the memory bandwidth of its predecessor, the Tesla K40. A single server with Tesla K80 delivers the same performance as 8 servers with our old Fermi generation GPU accelerators for a range of applications. A powerful endorsement of Tesla came just ahead of the recent Supercomputing 2014 Show. The U.S. Department of Energy announced that its next generation of supercomputers will utilize Tesla GPU accelerators in conjunction with our powerful new NVIDIA NVLink high-speed interconnect technology. These systems will be deployed at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. We'll be at least 3x faster than today's most powerful systems. These supercomputers will serve scientists across our nation in every field of science to accelerate their research for the next 20 years. Finally, NVIDIA's automotive platforms remain on a sharp upward trajectory, registering better than 80% growth on the year. More than 7.5 million cars with our technology are now on the road, up from 4.7 million a year ago. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Drive, a computing platform for next-generation advanced driver assistant systems and digital cockpits. NVIDIA Drive makes driving safer and more enjoyable by introducing surround vision and auto valet capabilities. Its cockpit computing platform includes 3D navigation systems, natural speech and image processing capabilities, dramatically transforming the automotive user interface. NVIDIA Drive is the first car computing platform, utilizing advances in deep learning. Drive will leverage our dramatic advances in deep learning for voice, language and image recognition to enable surrounding and situational awareness in cars. We believe deep learning is the key enabling technology to continue advancements and autonomous driving capabilities. At the heart of NVIDIA Drive is the recent announcement of Tegra X1, a 256-core super chip with over 1 teraflops of floating-point processing power built on the same Maxwell architecture. Rolled out only months earlier for high-level gaming, Tegra X1 provides the computational horsepower, computer vision and graphic capabilities for cars that can see and learn. Now let's take a more detailed look at the financials. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% year-over-year to a record $1.25 billion. Growth was driven by strength in gaming, data center, cloud and auto. Fourth quarter revenue was up 2% sequentially. The GPU business grew 8%, helped by Maxwell GPUs and the seasonal increase in consumer PCs. Overall, Tegra processor sales decreased 33%, as growth in our automotive and SHIELD devices was more than offset by lower revenue from smartphone and tablets. Fiscal 2015 revenue grew 13% to a record $4.68 billion. In our GPU business, revenue grew 13% in Q4 from a year earlier. Revenue from our PC gaming platforms rose 38% due to the popularity of our high-end Maxwell-based GTX GPUs. Tesla GPUs [ph] for accelerated computing increased strongly, driven by large project wins with cloud service providers. Tegra processors declined 15% from -- in Q4 from a year ago, as smartphone and tablet designs reached the end of their product life cycle. This was partially offset by the increased revenue from auto infotainment systems, which more than doubled, and from SHIELD devices. Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margin was 55.9%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 70 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.2%, also above our outlook and was up 70 basis points sequentially. Strength in margins from gaming and accelerated computing was partially offset by those from Tegra processors and certain inventory provisions for prior Tegra architectures. For fiscal 2015, GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 55.8%. These full year record levels were led by the strength of our high-end GPUs for gaming and accelerated computing. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $468 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. For fiscal 2015, GAAP operating expenses were $1.84 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.66 billion. The low single digit growth from the previous year represents discipline from our continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance return on invested capital. The U.S. Federal R&D tax credit was reinstated for calendar 2014. For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5%; non-GAAP was 16.9%, incorporating the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit. For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $193 million, up 31%, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.35 increased 40% from a year ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. For the full year, GAAP net income was $631 million, up 43%, and GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 51% from a year earlier. Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the full fiscal year of 2015, we paid $186 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.4 million shares for $814 million. As a result, we returned to shareholders $1 billion during fiscal 2015. Since restarting our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately $2.22 billion to shareholders. This represents 111% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal year 2013 through '15, reflecting the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years. In November of 2014, we announced our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, with the intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2016. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $474 million, down from $563 million in the prior quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was 483 million, up from 408 million in the prior quarter. This sequential increase included the ramping of our new Maxwell-based GPUs and Tegra-based SOCs and SHIELD devices. Cash flow from operating activities was $443 million, up from the $216 million in the prior quarter, reflecting higher net income and the annual payment from Intel. Free cash flow was $412 million in the fourth quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $54 million. Capital expenditures were $31 million. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 to be $1.16 billion, plus or minus 2%. Growth year-over-year is expected from our key platforms, gaming, data center and cloud and automotive. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is slightly higher than our Q4 performance, driven by our gaming and accelerated computing platforms. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $478 million, with non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $425 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect to maintain our operating expense levels near Q4 levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%, excluding the benefit of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit, which expired December of 2014. In summary, we are pleased with our record revenue for the quarter and the full year, which reflects strength across our platforms and businesses. Profitability as measured by earnings per diluted share increased 51% in fiscal 2015, as our revenue and gross margin growth continued to outpace our investment. This concludes our remarks, and we will now turn it back to the operator for questions. Please be sure to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Operator? [qa/>\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore. He's with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: [Audio Gap] the strong results and guidance. I guess the first question, Jen-Hsun, one for you on the Tegra side of the business. I know that can be inherently lumpy in how it operates, but can you talk about what you envision the biggest drivers in fiscal 2016 will be to get that business on a growth trajectory versus the year-over-year drop that it's currently running at?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Ross. First of all, thanks. Our strategy for Tegra is the focus on automotive, gaming. And wherever opportunities arise in OEMs, we surely will entertain it, but our fundamental focus is automotive and gaming. And you already heard Colette say that our automotive business nearly doubled year-over-year. Our gaming business is really strong, and we have some exciting things that we'd love to share with you at the -- in the near future. But that -- those are our 2 focuses for Tegra. And if you look at the opportunities that we're pursuing in the area of automotive, obviously, more and more cars are becoming computerized cars. And at CES, we announced a brand new platform called Drive. And Drive is basically a mobile super chip, a mobile super computer, with a ton of software on top. And it provides for 3 basic functionalities: The first is a very advanced digital cockpit. You know that we're incredibly good at computer graphics, and the things that we can do in the car with more and more displays showing up in the car is pretty wonderful. The second is a technology called surround vision. Beyond surround view, which is basically cameras connected around the car, surround vision not only allows you to see the images from the videos around the car, but also create a virtual environment around it and, using computer vision technology, keep your car alert of the surroundings. And the third is using a technology called deep learning that has been revolutionized recently and it's something that we're very much at the center of. Using deep learning, we can do voice processing, natural language processing and understanding of imagery so that the car can be more situational and environmentally aware. All of those technology -- technologies that I just described, we believe, will help pave the path to the self driving car. In the area of mobile, the gaming -- in the area of mobile gaming, the gaming market, as you know, is huge and is growing quite rapidly internationally. It's about a $70 billion business now. We know that mobile cloud is probably one of the most important disruptions in the history of computing, and yet there's really no computer gaming architecture that serves mobile cloud very well. And that's what SHIELD is all about, to create the platform that allows mobile cloud to bring gaming to a lot more people. And we think that by doing so, we'll be able to engage a much, much larger part of the overall gaming market than just PC gaming, okay? So our Tegra business model is about focusing on automotive and gaming.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. I guess, as my follow-up, a bigger-picture question for the GPU side of the equation. You talked about the GeForce business being up 38% year-over-year, and GPUs, as an entirety, were up 13%. Is there any color you can provide just into the size of the buckets within your GPU segment so we can get the little more granular in how we model those very disparate growth rates, whether it's the 4 segments you break out in your segment definition and the CFO commentary? Or any other color you give, that would be helpful.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our -- we serve 4 markets: gaming, automotive, enterprise graphics and high-performance computing and cloud computing. Those are the 4 major segments that we -- 4 major markets that we serve. GPUs serve gaming, enterprise graphics and cloud. Gaming, as we've said earlier, has grown, as you mentioned, 38% year-over-year. Our enterprise graphics business, the workstation business, is relatively flattish. However, our enterprise virtualization -- virtualized graphics platform called GRID about doubled year-over-year. And our Tesla business, which is our accelerated computing business about doubled year-over-year. The PC OEM business declined. The PC OEM business represents, I would say, low-teens maybe approximately part of our overall business. We've been talking about its decline for some time now. And this year, again, it declined. Obviously, the PC OEM business, representing umpteen percent of our overall GPU business, represents a substantially lower part of its profits because the gross margins at OEMs tend to be much lower. But nonetheless, it declined year-over-year, okay? So looking at those segments then, gaming grew, enterprise grew, cloud computing and high-performance computing grew, OEM business -- PC OEM business declined from a low umpteen percent level, okay?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nShankar Subramanian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. Just a follow-up on that GPU breakdown. Could you give a color on what's the -- based on the guidance given for Q1, how do those individual segments kind of play out?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. We guided seasonally down. And of course, as usual, we'll see how it turns out. But if you look at the position of each one of our platforms, our position in gaming is very strong. The gaming market globally is quite robust. We're still seeing gaming growth all around the world, and the production value of games is increasing all the time. And whenever the production value of a game increases, it requires more GPU performance. For the very first time in history, a game console has come out that uses essentially a PC architecture, and its performance is substantially higher than the average PC performance. And so as a result, we see a lot of adoption to our higher-end GPUs, and that's good. We also expect that the Tesla platform continues to be quite robust. We know now that GPUs are wonderful processors for massively parallel applications like deep learning. Deep learning could be used for voice recognition, natural language processing, image recognition, video tagging, all kinds of interesting applications that are made possible because of cloud computing and because there are so many sensors and images and voice being uploaded into the cloud. That's one of the drivers for Tesla, and the Tesla business has doubled year-over-year from a fairly large base now. My expectation is that this coming year, Tesla will remain on that trajectory, and I hope that Tesla will grow very nicely this coming year. GRID, another part of our GPU business, is all about enterprise virtualization. Because of GRID, we're now able -- companies are able to now virtualize beyond the data center all the way to the end-user computing device. For the very first time, it is now possible to virtualize graphics-intensive applications and make it possible for people to enjoy their applications wherever they are. So now you can be virtualized, it can be more secure, you can be more mobile, enjoy graphics on any device. That platform is growing nicely. A year ago, we had about 400 trials. Today, we have well over 1,000. And recently, the most -- the largest enterprise virtualization company in the world, VMware, has integrated GRID into vSphere, and it has been -- it has gone to production, and so we're seeing quite a bit of momentum from that production release. So these platforms are all growing nicely, and I expect this year to help drive our growth.\nShankar Subramanian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Great. So I just have a follow-up on the autos business. I know you have -- you talked about different products and features that you have been working on, and those seem to be kind of the -- maybe a high-end side of auto. But can you talk about the products that you have for the mid and low end because it looks like that might be the area where the scale is. And also talk about how you are -- you plan to increase the gross margin for auto systems [ph]. Because it looks like it's in the low 30s if I just back out all the numbers based on your reported numbers.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the answer to the second question I know better than the answer to the first, so I'll just answer that one first. The way to add -- the way to increase our gross margins is to continue to innovate and increase the amount of value-added that we bring. And if you recall a long time ago, a long time ago meaning about 10 years ago, NVIDIA's gross margins was about 30-some-odd percent. And over time, we made the platform more and more software-rich. Today, our gross margins are surely much, much higher than 35%. And so my expectations is to do the same on the NVIDIA Drive platform. It's intensely software-rich. I think somebody said that today, a car is about 10% software, but soon, the car will be about 80% software, and I think that's right. I think that's right. I mean, in the future, with electric cars, you have obviously still very sophisticated drivetrain and such, but the car is going to be largely a computer with software. And that's where we can add an enormous amount of value, and that's what Drive is all about. Adding value through a very powerful processor, of course, but most of the capabilities I described from the digital cockpit to surround vision, to deep learning is all about software. It's all the software that runs on top of TX1. So that's #1. On your question about high-end versus midrange, I believe that more and more of the car's value will be delivered through software. And if you have to deliver it through software, then the processor underneath it is obviously more and more important. And my expectation is that great computing platforms will extend well into midrange into the low-end part of the marketplace. And that's just -- that's a belief. And just as I believed a long time ago, that the car is going to be one of our most sophisticated computers, which is obviously, at this point, coming true, my sense is that it's going to continue to go down that path, and we're going to see a lot more computation capability inside the car. To the point where I actually believe that every car will have a good processor, the high-end cars will have many good processors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay. He's with Canaccord Genuity.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: I think the first one, Jen-Hsun, you made some interesting comments earlier about the need for, I guess, a fairly virtualized mobile gaming experience. I assume you're meaning across desktop tablets, smartphone, cloud, et cetera. One of the things that strikes me is, obviously, there's the suit going on between yourselves and Qualcomm, Samsung, et cetera. And your market share within the mobile graphics business when you think about smartphones is fairly small from a hardware perspective. So do you see that changing dramatically going forward? And if not, do you see the gaming mobile device market bifurcating from like the traditional smartphone market going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Matt, thanks a lot for that question. First of all, mobile is much more than phones. Mobile is a fundamentally new way of designing computers, and I believe that mobile will impact almost every segment of computing as we know it. It'll impact refrigerators. That's not a phone. It'll impact drones. That's not a phone. It'll impact earrings. That's not a phone. It'll impact watches. That's not a phone. It'll impact game consoles that is not a phone. It'll impact cars, and that's not a phone. I think mobile is going to be important in all kinds of computing devices. When I say mobile, that's what I mean. I don't mean mobile as in the mobile phone. Mobile technology is really important. I also believe that mobile cloud in combination is one of the most powerful computing forces that the computer industry has ever known. Because of mobile cloud, we've been able to extend the capabilities and the benefits of computing to billions of people, whereas in the PC area, we were able to benefit hundreds of millions of people. And yet no one has yet created a game platform around mobile cloud, the technology of mobile cloud, the power of mobile cloud, the architecture of mobile cloud, so that we can extend gaming not to tens of millions of game console users, but billions of users. I think that that's the great opportunity. And I don't have anything to announce today, but that's what we're trying to endeavor. So I appreciate you asking that question. I think it's going to be a really big opportunity for us.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division: As a follow-up, this one is for Colette. Obviously, you guys have done a great job in returning cash to shareholders and announcing new plans for the next fiscal year. Maybe as the last fiscal year ends, maybe you could update us on your onshore and offshore cash balances, if you could and any perspectives on the difference in cash flow onshore and offshore.\nColette M. Kress: Thanks, Matt, for the question. Again, we are looking at a cash balance lower than where we ended at fiscal year '14, due to our $1 billion return through shareholders, but also the increase in cash flow. Nothing has materially changed in terms of our cash flow from international and our cash flow in the U.S. So again, the majority of our cash flow tends to arrive from international overall operations. We have about the same mix of overall U.S. cash versus international cash, a little lower than where we ended at the end of fiscal year '14. But we feel very confident with our overall capital return program for fiscal year 16 and the overall cash flow prospects, so I think we're well aligned there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong. He's with Wells Fargo.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Can you give us some idea what percentage of Tegra is now automotive? And just a clarification, when you say that automotive infotainment more than doubled year-over-year, do you mean all automotive? Is there some other segment than infotainment or -- yes.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Most of our automotive today is infotainment. Some of -- more people are starting to do what Audi had done with their really amazing virtual cockpit, where infotainment and digital clusters merged into one. And digital clusters is much harder than infotainment. And so with Tegra, with our automotive platform, we're able to easily merge the 2. And so you'll see some more examples of that in the future. But initially, it's a largely infotainment, some amount of digital clusters, if that's your question. And between automotive and SHIELD, our gaming platform, that represents the vast majority of Tegra now.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And you also mentioned Tesla more than doubled from an already substantial base. Can you give us some idea of the size of Tesla today?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I'm sorry? Tesla?\nColette M. Kress: Tesla.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Tesla, yes.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Tesla is several hundred million dollars -- is multiple hundred dollars now.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On a quarterly basis?\nJen-Hsun Huang: On an annual basis. And it grew -- nearly doubled year-over-year so...\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland. He's with FBR Capital Markets.\nChristopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Can you guys talk a little bit about your eventual move to 20 nanometers? And it seems like you guys are staying on 28 for perhaps a bit longer than you have prior nodes. And if you are staying here for longer, is it safe to assume that you can get some gross margin uplift year-over-year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, let's see. We're always moving to the next node. And Tegra X1, the mobile super chip that we announced at CES, is 20 nanometer, and so we're always moving forward. But the equation is much more complicated than that, and the reason for that is because we have the ability because of the fact that we architect and innovate from architecture all the way to software, we have the ability to improve our performance and efficiency and features on all of those dimensions. We can improve at the architectural level using the same process. We can innovate at the design level using the same process and same architecture. We can innovate at the process level. We can innovate at the software level. We can innovate at the algorithm level. And because we control all of that, we have the ability to move the needle forward in multiple dimensions. And so if you look at Maxwell, Maxwell is an unbelievable energy-efficient processor. And because of the energy efficiency of Maxwell, not only did we make all of GeForce higher performance, lower power, quieter, we were also able to take that GPU just a few months later and put it into a Tegra X1, and the performance is really quite shocking. And so we could innovate on multiple levels as a company. That's one of the benefits. But overall, we're moving forward all the time in process technology.\nChristopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay, great. And then also at CES, love the automated driving stuff, but I was a little confused on the way that you're positioning yourself in that market, particularly sort of you against or either with Mobileye. I mean, I talked to one person, they say you're going head-to-head. I talked to another person, they say you're partnering. And I talked to another person at the booth who said that you guys are really enabling third parties to go after Mobileye. So how do you think about yourself positioning yourself in that market? Are you really going after them there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Oh, wow. I appreciate that question. I think it's a great question, and the answer is actually really simple. I mean, we are in 2 different things. We make 2 different things, and so we're very complementary. Mobileye, think of it as a computer vision signal processor ISP, if you will. It's connected to the camera, and they do wonderful work in computer vision in that area. The Drive platform is a computing platform. Just as a phone has an ISP as well as the application processor, in this case, we're the application processor, if you will. This application processor has been designed to be incredible in the 3 areas that I talked about, digital cockpit, surround vision and deep learning-based computer vision. And so many of the customers -- in fact, most of the customers that I know, where there is ADAS work being done, we're both involved. And so we're connected to many Mobileye devices, and we're delighted by that. But even if you're able to detect images and objects, you still need to do something to process that information, and we can do it -- we could reconstruct the surround environment. We still have to drive infotainment in the digital cluster. And of course, we could apply higher-level deep learning algorithms to figure out what to do with the objects that you detect. And so I see ourselves very, very complementary. And of course, because we're a general-purpose processor and it's 1 teraflops of computing, we can do a lot of things for computer vision. And that's probably where people are questioning the overlap. But from where I see it, we're very complementary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis. He's with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, just want to follow up on in terms of the auto opportunity, just your dollar -- how is your dollar content progressing? You're talking about selling modules, multiple processors and then more importantly, monetizing the software. And then if you could talk about some of the timing here, I think the auto OEMs have become a little quicker. Where are you today in terms of the generation of products you're selling, Tegra 3 or K1? And when could you see some of these more advanced systems actually hitting revenue?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I really appreciate the question, and you're exactly right. The dynamics are that more and more of the value of a car is going to have to go into its computing -- the heart and soul of its computing platform. And our expectations about our computer car and the software capabilities we can bring to bear over mechanical, electronic type of widgety things is going to grow substantially. Second, the fact of the matter is you can't spend 5 years designing a car anymore. Consumer electronics moves way too fast. People's expectations are set by what they have in their phones, and so you've got to move faster. And the most progressive car companies are moving at the speed of light now. They've taken their design cycle from 5 to 3, and I think I'm seeing them moving down to 2, potentially 1. And so this is going to be a brand new automotive industry. And the third thing that you mentioned is the content. Well, if you think about cars as a chip opportunity and it's an application processor opportunity like an infotainment like a smart phone, then, of course, it's in tens of dollars. But I actually see the car as a multi-thousand dollar computer opportunity. Some are one computer, some are many computers. And we're a computer company. We're a visual computing company. We are software-rich. All of the applications that I mentioned, the capabilities I mentioned are all software, we provide the entire BSP. We're one of the few companies in the automotive industry that can provide literally end-to-end solutions, and that's what Drive is about. Drive is a computer platform, software and all, and we provide capabilities across-the-board, okay? So I see the car, long term, as quite a large opportunity for us, not a chip opportunity because we're not a chip company anymore.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And just to reflect quickly on gross margin. I think you mentioned gaming as the tailwind for gross margin. Is that more a function of just Maxwell and pricing or you're actually seeing gaming not down as much seasonally? And then as you look out the rest of the year, how should we think of that tailwind?\nColette M. Kress: Yes, thanks for the question. So our gross margin guidance is just for Q1. We do see seasonal effects as we usually go from Q4 to Q1. We believe gaming is still a driver just due to the mix of the type that we're selling into the market, and we've also talked about accelerated computing and cloud also as a driver of our guidance in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maxwell is driving a solid sum expansion into the notebook market. I think you guys started to see that in Q3, with that segment up 2x year-over-year. Customer gaming notebook platforms were pretty visible during the holiday season. So I apologize if I missed this, but how much did the notebook gaming business grow for you guys in Q4? And maybe, Jen-Hsun, if you can just help us quantify where the attach rates could go and how much this expands your GPU gaming opportunity.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I really appreciate the question. Maxwell made it possible. So first of all, the background. Maxwell made it possible, for the very first time, the ability to put a high-end GPU in a laptop and deliver a desktop-quality experience. So you can now get a laptop with a GeForce in it and have -- and run AAA titles at 1080p and at quality levels and frame rates higher than the state-of-the-art game consoles. That's pretty amazing. You can now just have a nice and thin laptop, and it's better than a game console. It's better than a game console. And so people are quite excited about that. Maxwell made that possible. We see this business growing well over 100% per year at the moment simply because it's off of a small base. This has been an underserved part of the market for some time. We've really welcomed just about every company in the world -- laptop company in the world into this opportunity, from ASUS to MSI, GIGABYTE. Recently, even HP came into this. And I say even because, of course, HP is largely focused on enterprises, and yet this opportunity is so significant that their notebook business decided to jump into the GeForce platform. Of course, Dell; of course, Alienware; or course Razer. We're just seeing a lot of support from every notebook maker in the world because this is an unserved -- underserved market, if you will, and with the tech -- with the Maxwell energy efficiency, for the first time, we're able to deliver an experience that, quite frankly, is pretty amazing. And so where do I see the attach? I guess, I don't think about attach anymore, and the reason for that is because PC OEM business is not really our focus in the sense that it's already umpteen -- a low umpteen part of our business. The way we think about that business is, that's really a gaming business. And how big can it be really is a function of how many gamers are there in the world. And I think the numbers are actually quite substantial, are really quite substantial. So I see this as a growth opportunity for some time.\nHarlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, Colette, nice job on your part and on the team's part on the OpEx discipline in Q4 and here in Q1. How should we think about the OpEx trajectory for the remainder of the year?\nColette M. Kress: Yes, we really just are here to focus on our Q1 guidance and what we can see at this time. When we get further into the year, we'll talk about the full year. But again, we do just want to balance our Q1 with the investments that we need to make with, again, looking at the efficiencies across the org and what we can do. So I think that's a consistent theme. And you've seen us play that out in fiscal year '15, and our guidance for Q1 is about that same.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Jen-Hsun, one question on your GRID GPUs. I -- my impression was that you were very excited about the upcoming VMware release, and it has G8, obviously. I was just wondering if you -- does it give you better visibility in terms of upcoming deployments? And do you see that all the challenges that remain for the customers that were trialing GRID, they're really to deploy that? Or you see there are some missing pieces still? I just wanted to get some color on that.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, with VMware's integration, we're now able to engage probably some 80% of the world's enterprises. Just about anybody who has virtualized their enterprise had done so with VMware's technology. And so I think that this is a really big deal. And if you look at our trials, we went from about 400 last year at this time to well over 1,000 this year this time. Our revenues doubled. My sense is that there's no reason for that pace to slow, and we'll see how it turns out. But I would think that my intuition would be kind of like yours, that, if anything, you've got to accelerate. But there's really -- the most important thing about enterprise virtualization all the way to the client is to have deep integration with VMware, and we've done that, and they've done a great job. They've been a great partner.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, you guys indicated some large project wins with cloud service provider on Tesla's side. Could you give us some color on what exactly is the use case? You did talk about deep learning and image processing. I just wanted to understand a little bit, if you could give us more color. And where exactly are you on that ramp? Is that kind of a lumpy deployment that you saw or is that something very early in the ramp and we could continue to see that grow?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, a lot of these projects are quite confidential, but I'll highlight 2 that have been public. Baidu announced that they built a supercomputer based on Tesla for deep learning, and it's used for natural language processing, translations in real-time from language to language, image recognition. Another one that was public, I just saw yesterday -- and this is actually quite a monumental event. The event is, for the very first time, for the very first time in history, a computer is able to understand images better than humans. This is a milestone event in the development of neural nets, the development of computer vision, and it was announced by Microsoft yesterday. A human has -- the best human has the ability to detect and make errors on about 5.1% of the time or recognize 95% of the images that they are presented. For the very first time in history, a computer is now able to recognize over 95%, better than a human. That, I think, is really quite a record. We will remember this day for a long time and look back on it. And they also said that their deep neural nets were trained using NVIDIA GPUs. And so you could see -- these are couple of the examples, and they were public about it. In the coming event, there's a GTC coming up. It's on March 15?\nUnknown Executive: 17.\nJen-Hsun Huang: 17th, I'm sorry, March 17, our annual GPU Technology Conference. This year, we'll going to highlight deep learning and computer vision. I really, really encourage people who love computer technology to come and see some of the largest computer companies and most influential computer designers in the world talk about using GPUs in these areas. It's just a huge event, and this is going to be the largest GTC we've ever held. It's right here in San Jose, and this could be the Mecca for deep learning.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill with Needham.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Could you just talk a little bit about your transition to a platform company? You definitely, over the last few years, have transformed from a component supplier to more of a platform-based business, where you're getting higher margins. I'm just wondering kind of where we are in that development cycle. And how do you look at the overall business model over the next 3 to 5 years for the company?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I really appreciate the question. First of all, if you look at our company 10 years ago, 10 years ago, we were 100% PC OEMs largely. Maybe it wasn't 100%, but it was close. And now we're less than, we're only umpteen percent, substantially less than 20%. And so the company has been -- has been transitioning to this new model with our own platforms, largely software, and they serve 4 vertical markets. These 4 vertical markets have a characteristic that really, really benefits from great visual computing technology. And those 4 vertical markets, as I've mentioned, is gaming, is automotive, is enterprise graphics and is high-performance computing and cloud computing. And our PC OEM business is continuing to decline because PCs have largely become good enough, and it's fragmented. Most people use their PCs for information access, for working, and some people use it for gaming. And so for those gaming markets, we serve those. But for most of the generic and mainstream PCs, we've largely been out of those for some time. And so if you look at our business, it's now really focused on serving these 4 markets with our market-specialty platforms, and so I really appreciate that. The gross margins are obviously higher because it's very software-rich. If you extracted out the PC OEM business and just looked at those 4 segments, our gaming business, I think somebody mentioned, was growing at over 30%. Our automotive business has doubled. Our Tesla cloud computing business has doubled, and enterprise computing, our GRID business, has doubled year-over-year. And so those value-added, highly differentiated platforms are really growing nicely, and it's more than making up for the decline of our PC OEM business, which, as a result, our margins also increase. And so now you're starting to see the dynamics of the business, and it basically works like that.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So very good. And last question for me with respect to GRID. So I was wondering if you could maybe update us on the design engagements with GRID in 2014 relative to, say, 2013. And as you continue on this trajectory, can you talk a little bit about how the enterprises are beginning to realize the leverage that a cloud-based visual computing architecture enables? And when do you think -- because the installed base is very large, as you've mentioned. And do you think this year will be the inflection point or are we already past the inflection point and you think we're going to start to see more acceleration of this cloud-based digital system?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Well, there's -- let me break that question down into a couple of pieces. One, the number of OEM platforms that we were designed into, that we were designed into, was about 50 last year. It's almost 100 this year. About 50 this time last year, about 100 this time -- at this time. The number of trials we had last year was about 400. The number of trials we have here is about 1,000 plus. And the difference -- and I think the difference going forward for this coming year, when we stand here and look at this coming year backwards, I believe that what we're going to see is because of our now-completed integration with both VMware and Citrix and the fact that every single enterprise OEM has now adopted GRID and that GRID is making its way through just about every enterprise -- every company in the world as they get to be familiarized with them, I believe that this year could be a very important year for GRID. Now the second question that you asked is what are some of the things that people found are benefits of GRID, and I would say that there are several. The first one, the very first one is, of course, mobility. Mobility as in the sense that you can now access your PC applications from anywhere you happen to be, on any device you happen to be on. And so whatever device you have, all you have to do is have a browser and -- or an application, a receiver, if you will, a receiver application from VMware and Citrix, and you remote back into your PC. And every graphics application is perfectly compatible. The performance is wonderful, and it's where you left off, okay? So one is mobility. Second, for the benefit of the IT department, is security. No more digital downloads. The computer has now moved to the data center. The computer has moved to the data center, where the data is, so that you don't have to move the data to the client. I think that that's going to be an utter transformational event for security. And then the third is collaboration. Because more and more of us are working on the same data set and the data has become quite large, the ability to move the computer, if you will, to the data prevents all of us from having to download large data to our own client and become out of sync. And so now we can collaborate on the same data set because our computers are all right there in the data center. There are many other benefits, but these are the 3. I mean, I've also heard great stories. In Japan, one particular car company wanted to move all the workstations into the data center because it's dangerous to have so many heavy things in such tight environments. And during earthquakes, it's harder for them to manage all those different computers. And so they just have a mandate, push it all out into the data center. Another one, because of flexible workforces, this is now in Europe, large car companies do a lot of outsourcing. And because they work with different Tier 1s from a lot of different industries, it's hard for them to collaborate with them by having -- without having all their engineers of the Tier 1s of the subcontractors move on-site. And so now with GRID, they can actually have the computer be remotely accessed off-site in a secure way without digital download of the data, and the engineers, their subcontractors, can literally be everywhere. There are all kinds of anecdotal stuff. IT departments of colleges. Colleges are the perfect example -- another example. They have a large number of computers, but the computer per square meter is very, very low because, as you know, colleges are very large in campus. And then also, the people come and go. They only stay for a couple to 3 years by definition. And so in that particular case, putting all of the workstations in the data center has tremendous benefits to the IT department. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.\nStephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Jen-Hsun, if I could ask -- first ask about the gaming business in terms of PCs. In fiscal Q4, can you talk a little bit more about geographically how demand was across the developed markets as well as the emerging markets?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Stephen. Our largest market is China. As you know -- as you probably are -- could guess, GeForce is the largest game platform in China, and the reason for that is because it's a market that historically hasn't had access to game consoles. It's still extremely important, given how extremely expensive consoles are. And of course, most of the titles are from the West, and most of the titles that people enjoy in China tends to be multiplayer. It tends to be role-playing games. It tends to be Internet-based games. And so though China still remains our largest market, the fastest-growing market is probably Southeast Asia. These developing countries -- developing markets, excuse me, developing markets, then they get to a certain point in their computer history and Internet history, all of a sudden, the gaming market booms. And in that area, Southeast Asia, we know now the economies have become sufficiently vibrant because of the outpouring of opportunities from China. Those local regional economies have now become quite large and quite vibrant, and we're seeing the same thing now as we saw 5 years ago in China. We're seeing the same developments in Southeast Asia. So I would say that Southeast Asia is still -- is probably the fourth largest region, but it's the fastest-growing region by far. And then, of course, the U.S. and Europe are both quite vibrant.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities.\nAlex Gauna - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I was wondering, Jen-Hsun, if you could update us on what's going on in the licensing front. Perhaps comment on it if it's getting to the point where it might provide a tailwind to gross margins this year. Or if not this year, when?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our licensing discussions are ongoing and quite rigorous. And the thing that is, of course, very important to note is that we are unquestionably the world leader in digital computing. And we have created so much modern computer graphics it's almost hard to make -- even make a list of it anymore, fundamentally from the invention of the GPU to modern general-purpose computing, GPUs like CUDA and others. The type of work that we're doing is obviously pioneering, and it's very important to many markets. We're open to licensing technology to companies who would like to exercise their own design and build their differentiated products, but protecting our IP is extremely important to our company. We're in discussions. Of course, the most public discussion is the one with Samsung and Qualcomm, and we're looking forward to some of the developments that will be happening in just a few more months. And so I look forward to reporting on the developments in that area in the next several quarters.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners.\nIan Ing - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Could you talk about your foundry strategy a little bit? I mean, TSMC, a good supplier, but not considered the best FinFET out there. Would you consider diversification being something you'd evaluate?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, TSMC is a fabulous supplier. And number two, their FinFET technology is excellent, and we've been evaluating it. And we -- of course, we do test chips, and our test chip technology is incredibly rigorous, and we take it very, very seriously. This has come from the years of learning that and working with advanced process nodes and fast process ramps. We take it incredibly seriously. So we're working with TSMC on FinFET now for a couple of years, and so we have quite a bit of confidence in their ability to deliver amazing FinFET transistors. I guess with respect to that, we always look to look at all foundries, and TSMC remains our most strategic, of course, and they're going to continue to be a very, very important partner for us for the foreseeable future.\nColette M. Kress: Okay, operator, I think this is the end of our call.

For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today\u2019s earnings release, our most recent Form 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All of our statements are made as of today, November 6, 2014 based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our web site. With that let\u2019s start. Third quarter results were strong, with record revenue and improved performance in each of our businesses. Our focus on creating platforms for PC, mobile and datacenter is paying off. Our PC gaming platform benefited from the enthusiastic reception of our new flagship GeForce GTX gaming processors based on Maxwell. Our 10th generation GPU architecture, Maxwell sets new standards for performance and power efficiency, introducing a range of new features for gamers and game developers. Real time dynamic global illumination is a lead forward in replicating the true interaction of light in the gaming environment. Other new technologies render games at higher frame rates with very low power, heat and noise. Both the desktop versions of these processors, the GTX 980 and the GTX 970 and their notebook counterparts have won extraordinary support from reviewers. Forbes wrote of our new GPUs: They are higher performing and more power efficient than the previous generation and design win abound. That\u2019s pretty much a trifecta in the mobile market. Commenting the desktop versions, Hardware Canucks called the GTX 980 a market changing graphic card that is back stopped by an impressive GPU architecture. We launched Maxwell in a groundbreaking event for the gaming community called Game 24. This live stream 24 hour celebration included gaming tournaments, modding competitions and celebrity commentators. As it moved across the globe, all along the way we drew more than 1.3 million Twitch viewers in 120 countries. In the mobile platform space, the SHIELD tablet, the latest extension of our SHIELD family of devices enjoyed solid demand during the quarter. The ultimate tablet made for gamers, it features the extreme performance of Tegra K1 mobile processor and the precision control of the SHIELD wireless controller. SHIELD tablet sales have extended into many worldwide markets and the 32 gigabyte LTE model has been recently added to the lineup. Very soon SHILED tablet will be upgraded to Google\u2019s latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. Tegra K1 was also featured in the Google Nexus 9 tablet launched last month in a 64 bit version. Powered by our project Denver CPU, Tegra K1 is the first ARM processor for Android to take advantage of the Android 5.0 support for 64 bit architectures. Tegra K1 is also now in Chromebooks from Acer and HP. Tegra technology continues to make strong headway in the automotive segment as well. Last month Paris Auto show, Honda announced that three of its popular models will come standard in the European market with a Tegra based infotainment and navigation system. This marks the first in-vehicle infotainment system to use the Android operating system running on Tegra. Tegra will enable Honda Connect to deliver a touchscreen experience like the intuitive experience you'd experience from a phone or tablet with crisp graphics that respond instantly to gestures like pinch, zoom, and swipe, but is designed for safe operation in a car. Honda now joins Volkswagen in our stable, but mainstream auto brands relying on Tegra, complimenting luxury brands like Audi, BMW, Lamborghini and Tesla Motors. Our enterprise businesses also had a strong quarter, benefiting from new products and industry trends that fuel demand for them. Our Quadro professional solutions, including processors based on the new Maxwell GPU architecture are enjoying the fast ramp up of any Quadro product in our history. They are being shipped by all of our major OEMs and adopted by global enterprise companies. This new line up provides up to two times improvement in application performance and data handling capability. In the datacenter platform space, NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization continues to gain momentum. Thousands of companies have come forward worldwide to experience cloud based GPU accelerated virtual desktops through our tri-grid online demonstration. Also a program we launched in August with VMware for early customer access to GRID virtualized GPUs is drawing wide global interest. Initial customers include aircraft maker Airbus, the international construction group CH2M Hill, and healthcare provider MetroHealth. Other early notable GRID customers include Villanova University and Halliburton. Our Tesla accelerated datacenter platform continues to grow as HPC customers and cloud service providers deploy large Tesla powered systems. Fueling Tesla growth is the rapid rise of machine learning, particularly among mobile web service companies like China Baidu [ph] that are standardizing on Tesla as their common platform. As noted in the story, in the current issue of Wired GPUs are exceptionally well suited for parallel processing tasks, like speech recognition, image, and natural language processing. IBM unveiled its first open power based system featuring Tesla GPU accelerators which can significantly enhance Java, Big Data and technical computing applications. IBM announced plans to accelerate their enterprise applications using Tesla GPUs, including their nearly pervasive IBM DV2 with blue database software. We are excited about this month's Supercomputing 2014 conference New Orleans, where we will be demonstrating the latest breakthrough in supercomputing and visualization based on our Tesla accelerated computing platform. Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at the financials. Revenue growth year-over-year was driven by strength of GeForce GPUs for gaming related to our launch in Q3 of Maxwell GTX GPUs as well as the strength in datacenter GPUs and Auto Infotainment Systems. GPU business revenue grew 13% from a year earlier. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 36%, fueled by continued strength PC gaming, including Maxwell. Within this segment, gaming notebooks performed particularly well, more than doubling from year-ago levels. Tesla for high performance computing increased strongly, representing another record quarter of revenue driven by large project wins with cloud service providers and government customers. Quadro revenue remained strong, with our new product platform launched in August, delivering industry leading graphics and rendering performance. Tegra processor sales grew 51% from a year-ago, led by auto infotainment systems, mobile devices, embedded systems and the onset of the SHIELD tablet sales. Auto Infotainment systems revenue nearly doubled year-over-year. Revenue was up 11% from the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margins was 55.2%, in-line with our outlook for the quarter, down 90 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, also in-line with our outlook and down 90 basis points sequentially. The gross margin reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, inclusive of the product transition to Maxwell based GPUs for the desktop, notebook and workstation. Our margins from the above mentioned PC platforms and datacenter and cloud GPUs were partially offset by the impact of Tegra processor margins, which are lower than the Company\u2019s overall average. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $463 million, in line with our outlook and up 2% from Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $415 million, lower than our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investment in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance our return on invested capital. GAAP operating income was $213 million up 51% from the prior year\u2019s third quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $173 million, up 45% from a year earlier driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.31 increased 55% from $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the third quarter we paid $46 million in cash dividends and repurchased 16.8 million shares under a structured repurchase agreement entered into during the quarter. During the first three first quarters of fiscal year \u201915, we paid a $140 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.2 million shares. As a result we have returned to shareholders $950 million during the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201915. Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately 2.17 billion. This return represents 136% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 to date and reflects the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years. As we transition into fiscal year \u201916 as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we are pleased to announce our intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal year 2016. Accounts receivable at the end of Q3 were $563 million up from $470 million in Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to the mid-quarter launch of our Maxwell based GPUs and the late quarter project shipments in our database business, compared with last quarter. DSO at quarter end was 42 days, up from 39 days in Q2. Inventory at the end of Q3 was $408 million, up from $387 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase included the ramping of Maxwell based GPUs coupled with decreases in products based on previous-generation architectures. DSI at quarter-end was 68 days, down from 73 days at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operating activities was $216 million, up from $96 million in the prior quarter and from $162 million a year earlier. Our operating cash flow grew 33% year-over-year reflecting higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses, partially offset by higher accounts receivable. Free cash flow was $176 million in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million, capital expenditures were $40 million. Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The year-over-year growth is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for the PC, the notebook and mobile platforms. Additionally, we expect growth from our enterprise platforms. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is in line with our gross margin results in Q3, as high end GTX GPUs and datacenter results will contribute to the strong gross margins. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $470 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $422 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect operating expenses to remain near Q3 levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 18%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is a percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rate in the third quarter, excluding any discrete tax events. We are pleased with our record revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date with strength across all platforms and businesses. Profitability, as measured by earnings per diluted share, increased 55% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared with the prior year. Our 10th generation GPU Maxwell displayed a strong showing with stellar reviews and an innovative launch. We continue to embark on large engagements in datacenter and cloud with outstanding partners, IBM, HP, Dell, Citrix and VMware. Auto continues to gain ground with continued wins, including Honda this quarter. Tegra K1, through SHIELD and Nexus 9 continues to be praised for its technology achievement and expansion of Android gaming. We continue our transformation into a business focused on visual computing platforms, allowing us to realize continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming as well as in cloud datacenters, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities: First question I have is just to go deeper on some of the PC gaming trends [indiscernible]. Could you talk a little bit about how much strength you saw from a seasonal perspective for PC gaming and how much of it might have been from the new Maxwell product launch?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Stephen. First of all, you know that the gaming business is expanding globally. And we\u2019re seeing great strength in Asia. We\u2019re seeing great strength in developing countries. We\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm around MOBA, which is an online battle arena gameplay style. It\u2019s crossing over from being just video games to now being e-sports. And so the cultural implication of video games is getting greater and greater. There are several factors that drives our gaming business. One is whenever we see a really exciting new game come to market, games like Assassins Creed or Batman or some of the amazing Ubisoft games that we\u2019ve been seeing, Battlefield, Call of Duty, these incredible franchises that has millions of followers. And the second factor is whenever we introduce a new GPU architecture that is a huge leap from previous generations. Right now one of the most exciting things going on is driving beyond 1080p. 4k monitors are getting more and more cost effective. And without something like Maxwell, it's really hard to enjoy the full fidelity of a 4k display. And so these things all contribute. But I think at the highest level, gaming is just expanding globally. And now with Maxwell and a brand new architecture that gives us a huge leap from previous generation, we\u2019re going to draw people out to upgrade to Maxwell so that they can take their gaming experience to the next level. Now for the near term, Q3 of course we benefited tremendously from the Maxwell launch. Overall for the year, PC gaming for us was up over 30%. And so that gives you a sense of how PC gaming is expanding. Going into Q4, you\u2019re going to see some pretty amazing franchise titles coming out. It's the holiday season. And so we\u2019re looking forward to quite a good year in PC gaming. But overall PC gaming is expanding.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow up, just to touch upon the GRID business, so you mentioned the early customer access program for GRID with VMware. Any thoughts on the timing for how long that qualification cycle might take? And what kind of I guess brand profile we might expect going into next year for GRID and Tegra as a whole? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our datacenter business overall had a record quarter. And we\u2019re seeing expansion in our datacenter business in multiple ways. And I appreciate you recognizing GRID. We entered into a partnership with VMware to support early adaptors of vSphere, which is supporting our GRID Virtual GPU technology. With this VMware and GRID platform, NVIDIA GRID platform, you can now virtualize all of enterprise, all the way out to the clients, and you can make it possible for the most graphics intensive applications. Whether new or legacy PC applications, you can now virtualized it, stream the graphics to any heterogeneous device that your company decides to support. And we\u2019re seeing enthusiasm all over the world. In fact, since we announced this collaboration with them to develop the market together, we\u2019ve seen thousands of companies try GRID. It\u2019s easy to try. You might want to try it yourself. Just type in try GRID on the web and it will take you to a Web site and will download a small client and you can enjoy with the GRID experience and see what it\u2019s like. We have thousands of interested companies. We\u2019ve selected many around the world. Many of them are very large enterprises, who have several different needs. Some companies because their campus is quite large, and so it\u2019s hard for IT departments to support all of the various workstations and PCs that are scattered all over campus. Universities are the same way. Sometimes it\u2019s because the workforce has large fluctuations. Maybe they use a lot of contractors, maybe it\u2019s because students graduate every year. And so there's a lot of different reasons why virtualizing the enterprise desktop is incredibly valuable to these companies. As usual, enterprise validation and certification take some time. And so I don\u2019t know -- I can\u2019t give you a particular schedule, but I can tell you that the trials are going really well. And now because of VMware, we can now engage 90% of the world\u2019s virtualization opportunities and the size of opportunities that we\u2019re now looking at is getting larger and larger.\nColette Kress: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Moore - Morgan Stanley: Following up on the gaming question; the more than doubling in notebook gaming. Can you give us some context around that? That seems like a big growth rate. Is that a global phenomenon or is that kind of more regional and what do you think is driving that strength?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks a lot Joe. For the very first time in history we\u2019ve been able to get a GPU architecture that is able to do in a notebook form factor, achieve a level of performance that is on parity, on par with desktop PCs. This is a really-really big deal. In a thin notebook, Maxwell GPU, because it\u2019s two times the performance power factor compared to Kepler, which is already the most energy efficient GPU we\u2019ve ever built and the most energy efficient GPU in the world today, we lapped by a factor of two. And as a result we\u2019re able to bring to the notebook form factors, a level of performance that\u2019s on par with desktop. Now gamers don\u2019t have to choose. It\u2019s really just the matter of what kind of platform you\u2019re enjoying. And we know that a lot of people like laptops. So it's just that for gamers, until now, they\u2019ve not been able to gain access to that level of performance without Maxwell. So this is a big deal for us and we\u2019re quite excited about the Maxwell ramp and it's just beginning to ramp. My expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to grow the notebook gaming business for some time here.\nJoe Moore - Morgan Stanley: And then also on the client GPU business, can you talk a little bit about pricing? And it seems like your competitor hasn\u2019t had the success you guys have had and it sounds like it\u2019s being relatively price aggressive. They\u2019ve talked about that. Can you just talk about the pricing environment and does that competitive dynamic affect you guys at all?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, it\u2019s really related to value I think. Our strategy with GeForce has really moved away from a component pricing model for several years. And it\u2019s the reason why the value that is received by our gamers and appreciated by gamers continues to grow. We\u2019ve really taken much more of a software rich approach. Even though our GPU architecture is now far and away the best in the world, it\u2019s the most energy efficient, it's the highest performance. It has amazing technology like VXGI that was just announced recently. Although at the foundational technology, it is far and away the best, if you look at the software environment, what we call the GFE, the GeForce experience console that\u2019s on top, we really think about the GeForce as a GeForce gaming PC platform now. The software intensity of it is quite high. If you have GeForce Experience, your ability to enjoy games at it fullest is really incomparable. And so I think that people don\u2019t choose component A to component B anymore. Overtime we see a lot more return customers and once you get on the GeForce platform, you tend to stay on the GeForce platform. And our goal is just keep adding more and more value to the GeForce gamers that are to join the GeForce platform to earn their loyalty over time, and I think we're doing really good job there. I'm really proud of the team for their work here. And the results kind of show it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst : This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I have a question regarding the attach rates in traditional PC market. Do you see the declining attach rates in traditional PC to become a drag at some point? And if so, what kind of impact do you expect to see?\nJen-Hsun Huang: PC OEMs represent about less than 25% of our GPU business and much less than 25% of our overall business already. And within that there are some moving parts. PCs are becoming thinner and lighter, in some cases and as result they tend to not have GPUs attached. In some cases the PCs are becoming application specific PCs, like gaming notebooks, in which case the GPU not only is attached but the GPU becomes quite powerful indeed. On the other hand, workstation notebooks are growing. And so there's a lot of different moving parts, but I would say the mainstream commodity notebook PC, we have been seeing lower and lower GPU attach for quite a long time and it\u2019s not a surprise to us.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got it. On the datacenter cloud market, the recent market adoption of HPC as a core processor with Intel Xeon processors, do you see that as a stumbling block towards growing your datacenter and cloud revenue?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well FPGAs have been around for 30 years and they've been used all kinds of applications, far and wide in all kinds of areas. GPU accelerated datacenters is really quite a new phenomenon. And the benefit of a GPU accelerated datacenter is that the amount of total computational resource you could bring to bear is really quite amazing. It\u2019s not really practical, not really logical that one person or small team designing an FPGA could achieve the level of computational throughput that the NVIDIA R&D department with thousands and thousands of engineers, refining a singular architecture called CUDA over the years [indiscernible]. So it\u2019s not logical that that could happen. And then secondarily in CUDA, programming our GPUs is far, far, far easier than programming an FPGA. The R&D cost is a lot lower. The rate or iteration is much higher. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why Tesla has yet another record quarter. The number of platforms that support Tesla is growing all over the world and I think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing could add a lot of value in many areas of computing.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan: Looking into your revenue guidance for Q4, can you just tell us if your GeForce PC gaming segment is growing quarter-over-quarter and maybe that\u2019s potentially being offset by your PC OEM business? Jen-Hsun, as you mentioned, we just had the big launch of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. We've got the Assassin's Creed launch coming up soon. We've got several other blockbuster games in November. So I would assume that your PC gaming is up sequentially in January, but wanted to get your thoughts.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Harlan I appreciate that. We're expecting our gaming platforms and our enterprise datacenter platforms to be up quarter-to-quarter. Those are benefitting from both industry adoption of our platforms, as well as the fact that we are going into a brand new product cycle with Maxwell. We're also expecting our OEM business to be down sequentially, but our guidance reflects all that.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan: And then as you mentioned continued strength in enterprise, we\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] microprocessor ramp going into datacenters and HPCs. It was about 10% of the mix for Intel in Q3. One of the first big adopters, like I said does tend to be HPC and datacenter. So the question is how much of this is contributing to the strength in Tesla and potentially your GRID based products or is it more just sort of with Tesla and GRID, just prior design wins that are finally starting to ramp or maybe a combination of both?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well Tesla and GRID are both delivering record numbers at the moment, and they're driven by the fact that the enterprise adoption of our platforms are increasing. But in the grand scheme of things, they are still a small percentage of the world\u2019s overall servers. And so my sense is that those matters are important but they\u2019re not significant. Most of our adoptions tend to be related to new applications or an OEM certifying a new server for GRID, and there's a whole bunch of servers being certified right now, or a cloud datacenter service -- a service provider who is able to deploy their service using machine learning service or a natural language processing service or a music tagging service or some service that requires our GPUs deployed into production. And so those tend to the large reasons why we grow, more so than the microprocessor that it's attached to.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with you question.\nChris Hemmelgarn - Barclays : This is Chris Hemmelgarn on Blayne. Congrats on a good quarter. First, I was curious, with Intel\u2019s new Broadwell platform looking to launch late first half -- some point in the first half of Q -- of next year, are you guys, I guess concerned about any more pronounced seasonality in Q1 ahead of that product launch or would you expect kind of just general typical seasonal trends this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our OEM business is just a smaller and smaller part of our overall business driver. Most of the platforms that we offer engage specific vertical markets, whether it\u2019s gaming or high performance computing or enterprise virtualization or the cloud services with service providers who are the automotive industry. And so these verticals tend to be much more important in how we think about our business. We also see now that our OEMs or our OEM partners go into a new product cycle when we launch a new product. And so when there's a new Maxwell GPU recently, every notebook OEM in the world offered a brand new gaming notebook, irrespective of the rest of the platform and the reception of those notebooks have been fantastic. It\u2019s been so successful for us in the notebook gaming business, that for the very first time HP and Lenovo, both joined our GeForce gaming platform and offered gaming notebooks under their own brands. And so we\u2019re excited about the work that we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re seeing more and more this type of dynamic as we continue to transition our Company\u2019s business model from components business attached to other components to a platform model, where we engage vertical markets where we serve.\nChris Hemmelgarn - Barclays : And I guess follow-up, just turning to automotive business, obviously going quite well for you. You\u2019ve highlighted strength in infotainment this past quarter. It sounds like in December the new Tesla launching is going to support some type of autonomous driving. You guys had mentioned that at your last Analyst Day, I believe that that was one big opportunity for Tegra. I was just curious as to where you thought we were hitting a point where that could be a meaningful driver? You talked about the auto business doubling in consecutive years. Do you see some of these new opportunities \u2013 I guess a continued path for growth beyond that? Just kind of interested in your general thoughts?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we came into automotive industry because we think that the car is going to contain some of the powerful computers that we have and the future of the car is going to have computing in and not just infotainment, but the entire digital cockpit will be drive by computers and because of better and better auto-piloted capabilities, the car will become quite rich in supercomputing capabilities over time. And so this -- just in general, the car industry is quite a rich opportunity for our computing focus. Whether it's seeing around the car using visual computing technologies, or presenting information to the driver in all kinds of rich ways, whether it\u2019s Infotainment or your digital cockpit or heads up display or other technologies in the future, visual computing is going to play a huge role in the future of cars. So we\u2019re quite excited about the opportunities there.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Congratulations on very good results. Question on the GRID traction. In the past you talked about some design engagements and some metrics around that. I was wondering if you could perhaps update us a little bit on the trajectory of GRID in the enterprise as they begin to realize the leverage of cloud based visual computing.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well we continue to track it. We\u2019re over a 1,000 trials around the world. And we\u2019re going to focus our energy, because we now have OEM partners and virtualization platform partners like VMware and Citrix who all have sales forces that are out there selling the platform now. We\u2019re going to focus our energy to continue to evangelize GRID and to help the top customers, the top and the large engagements adopt GRID in trial and doing their trial performance of GRID. And so we\u2019re going to continue to track them and the number of opportunities continue to grow. I just mentioned earlier, as we partnered with VMware to take vSphere around the world, the number of customers who have come out to ask to be early adopters and to be part of the trial program is really quite exciting. And we put a web self-trial service up on the cloud called Try GRID and I encourage you all to try it. Thousands and thousands of companies have come out to try it. And so I think it stands to reason that enterprises around the world would like to virtualize their entire enterprise. It\u2019s more secure. It\u2019s more cost effective. It allows for a mobile work force, and in many industries quite a dynamic work force. The work force could ramp up and down pretty dramatically from season to season and because they work with a lot of contractors, they could be onsite and off and change quite rapidly. And so GRID virtualizes all of their workstations and PCs and makes it a lot easier for enterprises to support their dynamic work force. And so there's a lot of different reasons why GRID is just a really fantastic extension of the entire enterprise virtualization movement. And so it\u2019s the reason why all of these OEMs are supportive of GRID and why they\u2019re taking it to market.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: And my follow up question, on the fourth quarter revenue guidance, you had mentioned that the gaming platforms would be up sequentially and enterprise datacenter would be up sequentially. So that would imply that the Tegra business is down sequentially, in order to hit the numbers for the midpoint of the guidance. Just wondering is that's just normal seasonality that you\u2019re seeing in Tegra for Q4 or if there's any other issues that are going on there? If you could elaborate on Tegra going into Q4, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, our strategy is to continue to advance our own platforms that are addressing these local markets. And when I said the gaming platform was going to be up sequentially, I meant that our PC desktop, our PC notebook and our SHIELD gaming platforms would all be up sequentially. They would each all be up sequentially. Our OEM business will be down sequentially and part of it is PC OEMs and part of it is device OEMs.\nColette Kress: Operator, do we have another question? Operator, can you hear us? We can\u2019t hear you.\nOperator: Sorry about that. Technical difficulty. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Guana with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Guana - JMP Securities: Jen-Hsun, I know earlier that you addressed the issue of Broadwell being a little slower to market. But I'm kind of curious from a process technology perspective. Does the trouble that Intel is having with 14 nanometer mean anything to you as you work to bring FinFET technology to market? Does it make you nervous about your own timelines or does it make you more excited that you\u2019re going to be in a position to maybe compete with a like for like transistor technology in the 2015 timeframe?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, we have a lot of different levers. I\u2019ve been asked in the past about Moore's Law and I believe in Moore's Law. But Moore's Law is not just about physics. Moore's Law is also about architecture and innovation. And it\u2019s really in the final analysis about performance and it's really into final analysis about clever ideas. And if you take a look at Maxwell, Maxwell improved on Kepler by a factor of two times on the performance power factor. That\u2019s really quite substantial and arguably unheard of. That\u2019s incredibly -- that\u2019s much faster than Moore's Law. And so I believe in continued improvement in that area and that we have continue to add value through architecture, through design, through process and the combination of all that through software. All of those are levers for us. We\u2019re excited about the next generation of FinFET. The way that we deal with that that, you know that we've had quite a few scars in the past as we ramped up new process technology and we\u2019ve been better and better and better at it. And the reason why is because we have just an extraordinary team in advanced technology group working deeply with our foundry partners and ensuring through real creation of test chips and rigorous test methodologies and development methodologies that ensure that when we are ready to ramp that the processors are ready for us. And I can tell you that for the next couple of nodes, I feel pretty good about it because of that work.\nAlex Guana - JMP Securities: Okay. And you touched on what I also wanted to talk about Maxwell in the market right now. I'm wondering, can you give me an example or us an example I should say of some of the gaming titles or the evolution of the industry that\u2019s starting to take advantage of Maxwell\u2019s capabilities right now? And I'm wondering if the clear advantage Maxwell has in the market is leading into any progress on the licensing front? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Every gamer who buys Maxwell will immediately benefit from Maxwell, in literally every single game they play. And they will enjoy in one of three ways. If you are a desktop gamer and you\u2019re playing one of the most advanced games out there, you\u2019re going to benefit. And it\u2019s likely that you have a GTX 560 or GTX 660 or GTX 760 or GTX 670. There are 10 million gamers who have GPUs that are GeForce\u2019s that are installed in their systems that can benefit from a Maxwell upgrade. And when they install Maxwell, they\u2019re going to get the benefit of that 2x. They\u2019re going to either get better visual quality at the same frame rate or much higher frame rate at an even better and bigger quality. And so there's a lot of different ways they can enjoy that. If you are a notebook gamer, Maxwell allows you to enjoy desktop level of performance for the very first time in your laptop. And then even if you had a game, and this is what\u2019s really cool about Maxwell. Even if you have a game that already is running at 60 frames per second on your 1080p monitor, the thing that\u2019s really cool about Maxwell is that we can now render to effectively a 4k resolution on our chip and we\u2019ll display it at 1080p on your monitor. And so all of a sudden your 1080p monitor improves in fidelity, as if you had a 4k monitor. So there's a lot of different ways that you can enjoy it. Our licensing discussions are very active. And we have many in important stages. And I think at the highest level, the way to think about why we add value to several players in the industry is that the mobile device market is really commoditizing. And by adding NVIDIA GPU to their SoC, they can differentiate head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. And although there's a lot of different ways to differentiate, having the best processor in your mobile device is arguably the first way and arguably the best way of doing it. And so I think Maxwell surely adds value in that process. Tegra K1 adds an enormous amount of value in helping to validate the importance of our GPU and mobile applications. And so all of that helps.\nColette Kress: Operator, next question? Operator, we\u2019re having a challenge hearing you. Can we get the next question?\nOperator: Sorry about that. Technical difficulties. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Congratulations guys. Couple of questions there. On process node migrations, also to Alex question, what\u2019s the roadmap on the GPU side of the equation? Are you going to skip 20 nanometer and go straight to FinFET?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hans, we haven\u2019t announced our next generation products yet. And so we've got lot of great surprises for you guys and I'm excited about our next generation GPU. But right now we're enjoying ramping Maxwell. This is a brand new product cycle, and I don\u2019t remember our product cycle in our Company\u2019s history where we've had the lead that we have, the richness of applications in the gaming industry that we're ramping into, nor the number of vertical markets that we now serve, from gaming to design to cloud to high-performance computing, that we now serve that we're ramping this architecture into. And so Maxwell is unquestionably at this point a home run and we're just savoring the moment and ramping the living daylights out of it.\nHans Mosesmann - Raymond James: Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up Jen-Hsun. The game console guys have had a good year of a new product cycle to them. How do you compare this cycle for them versus PC gaming and Android gaming for that matter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would say that the early adaptors of the game console market will enjoy every single platform. I've got everyone. And they'll have the PC, they'll have game consoles. But my sense is that the game console platform is not likely to enjoy the hay days when it was really unambiguously the only and the best game platform to enjoy games. It's just not true anymore. There are just too many other ways to enjoy games. The PC has become the world\u2019s largest game platform. China, the developing countries around the world, PC is a piece of platform they already own. They can upgrade it two, three, four times without having to change the basic platform. So the total of cost of ownership of a game PC is quite attractive. And the games are incredible. And so PC has become unambiguously the largest platform in the world today. Tencent is the largest game company. You could see how they're doing. And then of course, mobile. How can we ignore the largest operating system in the world, Android and why it won\u2019t become a premier game platform is beyond imagination really. And so I think that there's too many other ways to enjoy games now, for the game console to enjoy the hay days of the past. But we'll see. The thing that I do know is this, without any question is that the PC is continuing to expand the number of titles. Great titles are coming to the PC. It's is continuing to grow and the quality of titles is growing up ever so fast. And then mobile gaming is going to be right around the corner.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia [ph]. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Jen-Hsun, one question on Tesla. Some of your peers who are participating in the HPC market, they are highlighting some increased visibility. I was just wondering if you could give us any color on your visibility into Tesla. It has proven to be a little bit lumpy in the past. I was just wondering what kind of visibility you are seeing in this environment today?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the number of applications that run on Tesla is growing and that is not a lumpy factor and it\u2019s continuing to grow. The number of customers of Tesla is growing. The number of industries that Tesla is servicing is growing. I think what really is happening is that it is now conventional wisdom that the accelerated computing model that we invented with Tesla is going to be a very important model for computing for as long as we see now. And when we go to Supercomputing this year and I hope that all of you keep an eye on it; I think Supercomputing is going to help us understand where accelerated computing fits in the psychology of computing around the world. I think it really is at the tipping point if not past, that accelerated computing can play a very important role in the whole field of computing. There's some applications where accelerating computing just utterly, utterly shines. Of course imaging is an area that accelerated computing does incredibly well. The number of applications related to understanding images and processing images, from satellites, from cameras all over the world, from smartphones from all over the world, understanding images is going to be just, if not the killer app, one of the major killer apps that we're looking at. This is a global phenomenon with all kinds of interesting applications. So high performance computing, accelerated computing at this point is really quite synonymous and I think that all the visibility that you see is just confirmation that we are down the right path.\nUnidentified Analyst : And you earlier said that obviously Tesla is a very small percentage of overall compute in datacenter. In that sense what is the kind of growth profile you have in your mind? How do you see this business growing over the next two to three years?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I think that someday all datacenters will be accelerated and because we\u2019re starting from a very small base, it explains why Tesla is one of our largest growth opportunities. And for two consecutive quarters, we\u2019ve now seen record quarters and the number of partners that are supporting Tesla is growing and the depth of which they support Tesla is increasing. And so I think Tesla is going to be a large business over time and I would be very surprised if there are important or large datacenters anywhere in the world that aren\u2019t somehow accelerated by GPUs.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our speakers.\nColette Kress: Thank you, operator. Thanks everyone for joining us. We look forward to talking to you the next time on our Q4 earnings call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our Web-site. So let's begin. Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 13% year-on-year and in line with our outlook. Gross margin was a record 56.1% and we delivered EPS up 38% year-on-year. The quarter's gross margins and overall profitability were better than we had anticipated, driven by strength in PC gaming GPUs and in datacenter and cloud platforms. PC gaming continued to deliver year-on-year growth in an expanding industry. GeForce sits at the center of the PC gaming ecosystem, now powering close to 100 million gaming PCs around the world. Our new entry-level GeForce GTX GPU delivers the performance of the latest generation consoles, making the GeForce gaming PC the largest target for developers of latest generation games. There's no better place to look for evidence of the strength in PC gaming than eSports. Last month's DOTA 2 Tournament in Seattle was televised on ESPN and carried total prize money of over $10 million, more than the British Open Golf Championship. The number of players playing League of Legends rose to about 67 million and they accumulated over 1 billion hours of playtime under the strong pipeline of AAA games launching on PC this fall, including new versions of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Call of Duty. In the workstation market, Adobe continue to push the use of GPUs with the addition of acceleration to Adobe Illustrator CC. Illustrator have millions of users worldwide. They could get up to a 10x performance boost by adding Quadro making the experience silky smooth. Tesla had a record quarter and demonstrated continued momentum in big data analytics and machine learning with some high volume purchases from consumer Web companies for image and voice proc4essing. Tesla sales for high-performance computing also grew and several OEMs announced they will ship Tesla-based servers combined with ARM64 SoCs. ARM64 server processors were initially targeted at micro Web service but GPUs expanded their market opportunity by providing them muscle to tackle HPC workloads. NVIDIA Tesla GPUs now power the world's 15 most energy-efficient supercomputers as listed in the Green500 list. Tesla also powers the faster computer in the U.S., the fastest in Europe and the world's fastest enterprise supercomputer. GRID sales continue to ramp in Q2, and also during the quarter we launched wrinkles we launched GRID Test Drive to help enterprise IT professionals experience the benefits that GRID can bring to their virtual desktop infrastructures. The services attracted more than 10,000 users in its first eight weeks. Companies are realizing quantifiable benefits by adopting GRID to virtualize demanding PC and workstation applications. GRID enabled Turkish Aerospace to rapidly scale its design team. Roger Williams University is providing students access across its vast campus to architecture and engineering applications 24x7, and Daewoo Shipbuilding is doubling the number of engineers who can collaborate live on their cloud based system. Moving now to mobile computing, this quarter we saw some major development. We launched the next member of the SHIELD family, the SHIELD tablet. Powered by Tegra K1, the SHIELD tablet is the highest performance tablet on the market. From top to bottom, processor, tablet, software and peripherals, the SHIELD tablet is designed to be the ultimate tablet for gamers. To understand the market for the SHIELD tablet, consider that Newzoo, a research company, estimates there are 1.6 billion gamers in the world today. Many of them are looking to buy a tablet, an idea supposed by the fact that 90% of Google Play revenue is generated by gaming. Press reaction has been great. Gizmodo described it as a gaming beast and so much more. AnandTech said that it's incredibly important to get the controller right for gaming devices and NVIDIA has nailed it. SlashGear said that it's the new high watermark for a well-rounded tablet. There are 400 plus games optimized today for touch and controller on Tegra and more and more are leveraging the power of Tegra K1. For example, the SHIELD tablet comes with Frozenbyte's Trine 2, a hit game on PlayStation 4. And Portal and Half Life 2, both from Valve software, have been optimized to Tegra K1. Half-Life 2 is the highest rated PC game in history having won over 50 Game of the Year awards and multiple Game of the Decade awards. An interesting new development is cross-platform multiplayer. War Thunder to be launched on SHIELD this fall by Gaijin Entertainment will offer massively multiplayer combat across Tegra, PC and PlayStation 4. As with GeForce on Windows, our strategy with SHIELD is to build the best game platform on Android, now one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. The SHIELD tablet is one more important element of our gaming strategy. Google used its annual developer conference, Google I/O, to announce the Android extension package for its next version of its operating system, Android L. It brings, in the company's words, desktop class gaming to Android, and they leveraged Tegra K1 to demonstrate its capabilities with Epic's start-of-the-art Unreal Engine 4. Tegra K1 also runs many other desktop-class engines including Source, Unity, CryEngine and id Tech. Supporting these game engines makes it much easier for developers to bring games to Android on Tegra K1. Android TV was also launched at I/O and Google gave every attendee a development platform based on Tegra. Finally, Google used I/O to launch Android Auto and demonstrated it with a Tegra powered infotainment system in Audi S3. Our automotive business grew more than 70% year-on-year. Volkswagen announced that the upcoming Passat will use Tegra to power its infotainment system following on from the Golf which is already shipping with Tegra. The new GT which features two Tegra chips has started production in Europe and Audi has upgraded the A7's infotainment system to include Tegra, evidence of the faster cycles possible with the use of our Visual Computing Module. Separately, BMW has started shipping the i3 and announced its i8, both powered by Tegra. Xiaomi's Mi Pad with the Tegra K1 started shipping in Q2 with the first 50,000 units selling out in four minutes. We expect the first Tegra K1 Chromebooks to start shipping this quarter and IDC expects the Chromebook market to triple over the next three years. In conclusion, our investments in differentiated platforms are delivering success in gaming, HPC, professional visualization design and in automotive markets. We've leveraged our visual computing IP to set the stage for accelerated growth. And with that behind, over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Chris. Hello everyone. Let me provide some details on the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue of $1.10 billion grew 13% year-over-year. Growth was driven by Tegra Processor sales, GeForce GPUs for gaming, Tesla and GRID for datacenter and cloud workloads. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 10%, fueled by continued strength in the gaming market, including the recently released GeForce GTX 750 and GTX 750 Ti, Maxwell-based GPUs. Tesla and GRID for datacenter and high performance computing increased significantly from VDI deployments and large project wins with cloud service providers, as well as high-end education and government customers. Quadro revenue increased, with particularly strong growth in mobile workstations. Tegra processor sales grew 200% from a year ago led by mobile devices and automobile infotainment systems. Revenue from Tegra processors for automobiles grew 74% year-over-year. All key platforms for growth, gaming, datacenter and cloud, and mobile showed strong growth this quarter. Our transformation into visual computing systems and solutions allows us to realize the continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming, as well as realize the growth in cloud datacenters, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles. The GPU business declined 2% sequentially as we executed well during the seasonal decline of consumer desktop GPUs. We believe we outperformed the market for consumer PCs led by our overall performance and ecosystem supporting PC gaming. Quadro, Tesla and GRID, all grew sequentially as well. Moving to gross margins, GAAP gross margin was 56.1%, up 130 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.4%, up 130 basis points sequentially. These margins were both a record and better than our outlook. The increases reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, datacenter and cloud, and partially offset by the increased volume in Tegra processors. Compared to our outlook, the higher gross margin levels were driven by strong absolute average selling prices for consumer GPUs and aided by our record quarter for Tesla and datacenter solution. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $456 million, in line with our outlook and essentially flat from the prior quarter\u2019s $453 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $411 million, flat from the prior quarter. With continued management of our investments through alignment to a single unified architecture, we produced a third consecutive quarter of flat operating expenses. Operating expenses grew slightly year-over-year due to employee additions, employee compensation increases and related costs, partially offset by lower engineering development costs. GAAP operating income was $163 million, up 55% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $128 million, up 33% from a year earlier, driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 increased 38% from $0.16 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases. Now turning to some key balance sheet items, during the second quarter we paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 6.8 million shares under the $500 million structured repurchase agreement we entered into in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we had paid $47 million in cash dividends and received 20.6 million shares under the agreement. As a result, during the first half, we have returned $594 million of the $1 billion we intend to return to shareholders in fiscal 2015. Accounts receivable at the end of the quarter were $470 million, up $74 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to less linear second quarter shipments compared to the first quarter. DSO at the quarter-end was 39 days, up from 33 days in the prior quarter, and flat from the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $387 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter. The sequential decrease includes the ramping of Tegra processor products and products based on new GPU architectures, which were more than offset by decreases in products based on our previous-generation architectures. DSI at the quarter-end was 73 days, up from 72 days in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $96 million, down from $151 million in the prior quarter and flat from $96 million a year earlier. The sequential decrease was primarily due to higher levels of accounts receivable and lower payables than the prior quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, the operating cash flow reflected higher net income from improved gross profit and contained operating expenses, offset by lower payables outstanding. Free cash flow was $74 million in the second quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $56 million. Capital expenditures were $23 million, lower than our outlook of $40 million. Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, following our $1.1 billion in second quarter, we expect revenue for the third quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The sequential revenue growth of 9% is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for PC and mobile platforms, datacenter and cloud solutions, and automobiles. We expect our consumer GPU business to be up seasonally in the third quarter. Our Tegra business is also expected to grow sequentially. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook reflects higher expected Tegra processor revenue which has overall lower margins than our Company total, a greater mix of devices versus SoCs with Tegra compared to the second quarter, and expected growth in volumes of consumer GPUs. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $463 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $416 million, nearly flat with expense levels for Q2. Our operating expenses in the third quarter will reflect an onset of our annual compensation increases and expenses associated with our higher revenue. We will continue to manage through our fourth consecutive quarter of maintaining operating expense levels. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter and annual 2015 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is 1 percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rate in the second quarter excluding any discrete tax events. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Chris and we'll open up for questions.\nChris Evenden: Thanks. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Colin, over to you please.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs: Congrats on the strong results. This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping you could talk about relative to guidance, you mentioned a number of business lines that are doing well right now, maybe you could talk about which ones of those you would highlight just in terms of magnitude driving the strength in the quarter?\nColette Kress: In terms of how we did versus the quarter in Q2 versus our guidance, is that the statement?\nGabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs: Sorry, within the guidance for third quarter.\nColette Kress: Correct. In terms of where we think the growth will stem from, from a revenue perspective, again it is usually a seasonally uptick in terms of our overall consumer GPUs that are there for gaming as we get ready for the second half of the year on the high gaming season. So, that we do expect to be a significant contributor to our overall revenue growth sequentially of 9%. Additionally, we also expect our overall Tegra business to also grow sequentially associated with both our SoCs particularly for auto will increase and also what we expect for our devices as well.\nGabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs: That's helpful, thank you. And then just as a follow-up if I may on the gross margin guidance, maybe if you could just give us a sense of the longer-term as to what level is sustainable just with some of the tailwinds that you have from richer mix shift over the next few quarters or so?\nColette Kress: So, we talked quite a bit about what will contribute to our gross margins going forward and we do expect in any one quarter to see seasonal increases or potentially large projects completed in some of our enterprise businesses. So it's really a nature of the overall mix over a longer-term period of time which will influence our gross margins long-term. When you think about our overall enterprise businesses from Tesla, GRID and overall Quadro, which carry slightly higher gross margins than overall Company average, and depending on the seasonality of some of those businesses as well as large projects that we may complete, you will see our gross margins be very strong. Our overall consumer GPUs, we've done a very solid job in keeping our overall gross margins with solid ASPs and that should contribute as well in the quarters which we have strong growth. Then thirdly, when you think about our overall Tegra business, it is a case in terms of volumes and we do know that these are lower overall gross margins than our Company average. So depending on when those volumes hit, it can also affect the overall Company's gross margin. But at this time, it is hard to say in precise every single quarter in terms of what that guidance will be but those are generally the factors that will influence our gross margin ranges going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I think you had mentioned about 10% growth in gaming revenues. I'm curious, how much of that growth is coming from unit growth versus just stronger ASPs or share gains from AMD?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Vivek, this is Jen-Hsun. If you take a look at the overall gaming market, it is surely growing. Depending on which one of the analysts you follow, the vast majority of them see that global gaming market is growing about 10%, a little bit over 10%. If you take a look at the largest gaming franchise today, they are mostly associated with massively online battle arena games called MOBA games. Whether it's League of Legends or DOTA 2, the two combined has nearly 100 million gamers and each day there are some 10 million gamers playing these two games. The size of the eSports, competitive sports associated with these two games, is becoming quite a large industry in itself. China is still growing, Southeast Asia is extremely underexposed and those markets are growing. And so, I think that it's fair to say that the gaming market overall is still growing. ASP is increasing and the reason why ASP is increasing is because the production value of games are increasing. The latest generation game consoles are now out. The entry-level GTX, GeForce GTX, with a street price of about $100 is comparable in performance to a next generation game console. And so, if the market shifts to even that level, our ASP has quite a lot of room to still grow. And so as the production value of games continue to grow, I think we're going to see our ASPs grow. And so I would say that the dynamics of the gaming industry, PC gaming industry is really quite healthy, both in more and more players playing and ASPs increasing because of production value. Now when you think about it in terms of our own platform, there's almost I would say there's about 100 million GeForce gamers around the world, they are active gamers around the world. And yet we know there are several hundred million gamers altogether and PC gaming is becoming more and more popular for the reasons that I've mentioned already and others. My sense is that we still have quite a bit of penetration to go. And so these are the dynamics that are helping us.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks Jen-Hsun, very helpful. And then as my follow-up, there has been a lot of discussion or concern about the royalty payments from Intel since they are a very important part of your EPS and domestic cash, and I do realize the agreement runs for a few years, but when do you need to start to renegotiate and do you think the new agreement would be flat, up or down from what you have right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang: It's hard to predict the future but there are some things that we know. NVIDIA invents more in modern computer graphics than just about all of the world's companies combined. We invented the GPU, we invented GPGPU, we invented the ability for GPUs to be virtualized so that you can put it in the cloud and that's one of the reasons why our cloud computing business has grown so fast now. We're continuing to focus on this one specialized field of computing that's becoming more and more important. I don't know of too many technology companies in the world today who doesn't rely on technologies that we've invented. Technology licensing is an important part of our business. Long before there was Intel licensing our technology, there were other companies licensing our technology. We have licensing revenues as a component of our business now for 15 plus years. And so my expectation is that licensing revenues will continue to be an important part of our income for quite some time to come. Now there's a second component that's really important which is, whereas we historically were able to license to mostly PC companies, we can now license to mobile and cloud companies. And so those are new opportunities for us. And then lastly, we no longer just license IP as in patents, we've productised our design into a core and that core could be licensed, so that makes it easier for companies who would like to innovate and build their own products to be able to license our technology. We have now more ways to engage customers in IP licensing. We're serious about this business, we're actively working on these matters, they take time, but I'm very confident that licensing will continue to be an important part of our business going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J. P. Morgan Chase. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur - J. P. Morgan: Congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The Q3 guidance signifies revenue growth of 14% on a year-over-year basis. Your GPU business in particular, that grew double-digits year-over-year in Q1 and took a bit of a pause in Q2, I'm assuming just weaker consumer PCs. The question is, are you looking forward to GPU business to return to double-digits year-over-year growth in Q3, and if you are, if you could just highlight some of the drivers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, Q2 is seasonally slower than all of the other quarters, and considering the performance that we had, it was actually quite extraordinary. And our expectation is that Q3 will return to its traditional seasonal growth era. There's a couple of other dynamics that's going on now. There are some really big titles coming this fall. I don't remember a time when PC gaming is going to benefit from the huge titles that are coming out this fall at the pace that it is. And partly the reason for that is because this is the first year, the first major year, first full year of next generation game consoles, and so these new large franchise titles like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed are going to hit the market. And ultimately what drives our business, some seasonality, of course Christmas matters, of course back-to-school matters, of course Chinese New Year matters, but ultimately what really drives our business are huge games, and this fall we're going to see some really, really huge titles. Our position in the marketplace is fantastic. GeForce is really the best gaming platform for PCs today, it's not even close anymore. I think that because of the technology, we know that Kepler has been a fantastic platform for us, Maxwell is even better than that, but all of the software and all the application technology that we put around GeForce has really changed its profile for gamers. Not only can you play great games now, you could use our GeForce Experience, which has been installed some 40 million times, there are 40 million PCs around the world that now has GeForce Experience inside so that you could record completely in the background without affecting your gameplay and stream it to Twitch, which as you probably know very well at this point is the largest real-time video platform in the world, and a lot of those gamers are streaming using GeForce and the number of concurrent viewers is really quite amazing. And so, GeForce as a gaming platform has really reached a level that is pretty substantial and my expectation is that this holiday season, this fall is going to be pretty big.\nHarlan Sur - J. P. Morgan: Okay, thanks for that Jen-Hsun. And then, Colette, on the OpEx front, I mean obviously the team is certainly delivering to its target of $1.65 billion in OpEx this year and it seems clear that the team is going to continue to drive an OpEx profile that is below your revenue run rate. Any way to just help us quantify OpEx growth versus revenue growth from a longer-term perspective?\nColette Kress: I think we're looking quite nicely at how we've executed over the last three quarters. It's definitely been through a lot of work thinking about how much better we can execute as a company with our overall business groups and working on reallocating investments across. And to look farther, there's continued day to day conversations about where those growth opportunities are on the top line and are we the best positioned at this time with our investments for those. So right now, I'd like to get through the rest of the fiscal year and I think we'll reassess what does that look like going forward, but I don't have anything at this time to give on a longer-term perspective. But I thank you for recognizing the great work on growing the top line and maintaining a very consistent OpEx base to improve the profitability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with the Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Your primary competitor had some issues with channel inventory on their side. It doesn't appear to be impacting you guys at all. But Jen-Hsun, could you give us some color, a little commentary on what you see going on in the channel right now for the GPU business please?\nJen-Hsun Huang: You're going to have to ask them for commentary about their channel inventory. In our case, we've seen spot shortages around the world. We're really super-focused on making sure that GeForce is the world's best gaming platform for PCs. It doesn't mean that, it doesn't mean alone that it has to be \u2013 just being the world's best GPU is not enough. We're surely the best GPU but being the GPU is just the first bar, if you will, for being a great gaming platform. And for us today, GeForce, all of the technology that we put into game-works, all the work that we do with game developers around the world, GeForce Experience which as I mentioned earlier has been installed some 40 million times, has really turned GeForce into one of the largest gaming platforms in the world. And if you're a gamer and you have GeForce in your system, you can be assured you're going to have a great experience. We're incredibly dedicated to the user experience, we're incredibly dedicated to making sure that every single game works perfectly and works marvellously as it can be in your PC. The amount of dedication that we put into this platform, this living breathing platform that's evolving and changing literally every day, is something that we've really mastered and it's something that has taken us well over a decade to do, and I think people are starting to recognize that. And as the PC market continues to become the most important gaming platform because of its open nature, you don't pay royalties to proprietary platforms, the installed base is really quite large now as you could imagine, and for most people outside of United States where disposable income is still rather challenging, a PC is necessary for most of them, everything else is a luxury, and so the fact that GeForce is extended inside a PC, on a platform that you already know you need, makes it quite a unique gaming platform. And so I think the comments that we've made over the years and as you've followed us over the years, we've been consistently dedicated to this game platform and I think it's starting to pay off now.\nRoss Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Great, thanks for that. And one is my follow-up for Colette, on the cash return side, you guys are nicely ahead of the $1 billion run rate, so that's working out well. Just wondered, is the ASR now complete, and if so, in the back half of the year to get up to that $1 billion number, is the plan to be much more of an organic day-by-day buyback plan or is there something more that you have in plan for us?\nColette Kress: In the end of Q2, yes, we had completed the outstanding ASR that we began shortly after our Q1 earnings release. In the second half of the year, we are committed to meeting the full-year plan for $1 billion. Breaking that down, the dividend payments are still in the second half of the year, a part of the remaining balance to go, and then the amount of repurchasing as well. We're still assessing what the best method is overall to do that and we'll have something for you at the next earnings call definitely on how we executed within that quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Nice results. I was wondering a couple of questions. One, if you could quantify, you mentioned gaming up 10%, how much is that of the overall GPU business? And then if you could talk about if overall ASPs were up in the July quarter as well?\nColette Kress: It's a very good percentage of our overall consumer GPU business and we've talked about that remember our professional workstation GPUs are also in the overall GPU business as well as what we have for the overall datacenter with Tesla and our overall cloud in terms of GRID, but as a percentage of our overall consumer, it is a significant proportion of our overall consumer GPU.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then I guess if you could just, the ASP trends overall in July and then your expectations into October, you're looking for another step-up in ASPs?\nColette Kress: The ASPs are definitely a lot of different factors in terms of how certain things fell into the channel with certain OEMs or in terms of any just overall add in market. So it's real hard for us to lay out that mix perfectly over that. We believe what we've seen right now is extremely stable, if not from year-over-year, overall increases in our overall average ASPs over that period of time. So we'll get to see what that looks like as we go into the gaming season in the second half of the year, but you are correct that our overall gaming portfolio GPUs do carry overall higher than the average across our overall consumer GPUs.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Blayne, you know what, just to add to that, one of the things that surely everyone is noticing now is that our business is really moving away from being a components business to being much more of a platform business, that's obviously built on top of a processor. Our ASPs for datacenters and for the cloud computing platforms are much, much higher than our ASPs for PCs, not only because the processors themselves are much more complex, because it has to be shared by many people, it's virtualized. It's designed for datacenter and so the robustness for it, the reliability of it, the quality of it has to be at a level that is able to sustain 24x7 operations. But mostly the reason is because the software stacked on top of it is really complex. Most of our datacenter business, most of our cloud computing business isn't really a software business anymore, it's really about GPU virtualization, it's really about high-performance computing, it's really about the ability to serve accelerated cloud computing. And so, our ASP profile is going to have to start changing over time. Tracking PC sales and then multiplying that by some ASP is not a logical way to think about our business anymore, because of cloud computing platforms, because increasingly our business is really a platform business. I hope that's helpful.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital: Thanks for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity: In your prepared remarks, there was some mention, and Jen-Hsun, you just mentioned it as well, sort of a longer-term growth in the datacenter for cloud computing and HPC around your GPU and the platform. I'd be interested, it seems like there were some developments relatively recently around your partnerships with other ARM 64-bit vendors maybe versus your own internally developed solutions. Maybe you could give us an update about what the strategy is going forward for attack in that market and is I guess the general purpose compute engine that sits next to your GPU in those applications of paramount importance to you or does your GPU really drives the value?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, I think I've said this before and I continue to believe it and more so every day, that the datacenter and accelerated cloud computing will likely be the largest opportunity that the Company is following today. Our ASPs there are many, many, many times higher than our ASPs in average. The gross margins are obviously a lot higher, primarily because it's a software business. Now, at the center of that platform strategy is recognizing that datacenters, Internet service providers, cloud service providers, even countries who have their own supercomputing interests, have rather different opinions about what kind of CPUs they use. They don't all want exactly the same instruction set architecture. What we've done with Tesla is, and what we've done with our GPUs, GRID and Tesla, is established a bit of an ISA-neutral attitude about what datacenters can and cannot use, and we believe that people want to use whatever instruction set architecture they would like to use and we've created the ability to support x86, we support Power with our announcements with IBM, a very deep and quite a broad strategic alliance to bring accelerated computing to the Power platform, and also ARM. Of course we care about ARM. ARM is one of the most pervasive CPU ISAs in the world, it is very accessible, it's available to anybody who would like to build CPUs around them. And so, our first philosophy is focus on building a platform for accelerated cloud computing, accelerated computing. Our second is to be ISA-neutral, so that Tesla could be a platform that any service provider or any datacenter can build around. And then third, if it makes sense for us to build CPUs for those platforms ourselves, we'll consider doing so, but it kind of goes in that particular order. Is that helpful?\nMatt Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity: That's really helpful perspective, thank you. And then as my follow-up for Colette, there's been a lot of conversation on the call here about the progress on capital returns. If you could give us, one question is, an update on the domestic cash balance, and then just going forward after the $1 billion is completed through the year, maybe you could give an update on your longer-term philosophy about capital returns relative to that domestic cash position?\nColette Kress: So we've been pretty clear that when you look at our overall cash balance and our overall cash flow, a good percentage of our cash flow extends from our international operations and the overall revenue that we receive from a good percentage of our business. From time to time, we'll have a little bit of peak in the U.S. in terms of some of the providers that we do business with in the U.S., but I'd say more than the majority, our significant amount of the earnings are earned overseas. So overall, cash balance about a November year ago, we infused with the overall convertible debt which added $1.5 billion. So right now, outside of the Intel payments as well that come once a year, it's pretty steady and it may grow a little bit from time to time, but I'd say it's just right now at about a steady level. Secondly, when talking about our overall capital return from a long-term perspective, we are really trying to look at our overall growth this year. We've executed strongly to the $1 billion that we put out for the fiscal year and we're just about half way through that right now, and so we'll continue to look what is the appropriate level for long-term. As you know, we're executing to return more than 100% of our free cash flow, that you've seen in this quarter and the last quarter. But over the last three years, we've probably been executing on average anywhere from about 70% to 80% of our free cash flow. So, stay tuned, let us get through this year in terms of the $1 billion and we'll look in terms of what the future will lie after we look at that overall cash balance and the options that we can do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Once again, Mr. Moore, your line is live, please proceed with your question. Alright, moving along, our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Wong Wells Fargo: To push a bit further on a couple of the earlier questions, your GPU segments that are growing are the higher ASP segments. So year-over-year GPU sales grew 2% but ASPs also rose a fair amount, didn't they? So did your unit shipments for GPUs overall actually declined on a year-over-year basis in June?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I would think so. I would think that it declined a little, and the reason of course has to do with the fact that the consumer PC market overall declined. You know very well that our consumer PC business is a components business and those components' ASPs are rather low and the margins are lower. And although we care about that business very much, components business and volume business does provide scale and it leverages our R&D anyhow, and so we surely appreciate the business, but in the final analysis the consumer PC market was down and I think that the consumer PC market is expected to be more stable now and we'll see how it trends out.\nDavid Wong Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And my other question, what portion of total Tegra sales is Tegra for automotive at the moment, and did your current level of R&D spending have meaningful spending on Tegra for smartphones and tablets or is it, is the Tegra R&D primarily on automotive products?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our Tegra strategy is really centered around several areas. One is automotive, as you've mentioned, a business that has grown to be quite sizable. I think Colette mentioned earlier that it grew 70% year-over-year. We're expecting the growth to continue for the next several years. The pipeline of projects that we know that we're already working on that will go into production is relatively well understood now. On the second is gaming. Android is the world's largest computing platform and gaming, we've shortened to computer gaming, and with a great computing platform like Windows, we were able to build a franchise called GeForce on top of it. Our strategy with SHIELD is exactly the same as that, to leverage the Android platform, which is now the world's largest computing platform, and build a gaming platform out of it and we call that SHIELD. The mobile platform is now extended beyond phones and has gone into tablets, as you know of course, but recently also into television. This fall I'm looking forward to seeing some exciting products for Android TVs and hopefully NVIDIA could be part of some of those. Our focus is primarily there, the vast majority of our focus, automotive, consoles, if you will, Android TV consoles, gaming, and wherever we can, wherever it makes sense for us, continue to engage with OEMs like Xiaomi and others who are building exciting devices where Tegra could be a differentiator for them, and that's basically our strategy and where we're focusing our R&D.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: Thank you and congrats on the good results. Just given the changing mix of your business, could you maybe talk a little bit about seasonality in the fourth quarter, fiscal fourth quarter and how do you see that relative to kind of historical patterns?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We're talking about fiscal third quarter, but I appreciate it, Raj.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: No, I mean in general now that the\u2026\nJen-Hsun Huang: We'll talk about fiscal fourth quarter next quarter.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: No, to just kind of get a sense of kind of how the patterns are changing given the mix of the business, the changing trends of the business.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I appreciate that, I was just kidding. Look, consumer business is still a large part of our business and GeForce for PC gaming is a large part of our business, and for the foreseeable future I expect it to be a large part of our business. Consumer business is important to us because consumers drive a lot of computing technology today and obviously the volumes are much, much higher and it's important to have high-volume business to drive the flywheel of R&D. And so I appreciate the seasonality, GeForce is going to benefit from that in the third and fourth quarter, but increasing over time \u2013 and one of the things you're highlighting here is that our datacenter business, our cloud computing business, our high-performance computing business are not affected by those kind of seasonality, people buy those platforms when they need those platforms, and the dynamic trends of those businesses are several. One, the more mobile devices in the world, the more pictures people take, the more videos they upload, the more they talk into their phones for search, more of those applications, those consumer applications are going to be accelerated by GPU in the cloud. And so those are great opportunities for us and I think it's pretty clear now the dynamic trends of consumer generated media, as it's censored to cloud, shared and processed and otherwise, is growing I guess at least exponentially and I think that that's one of the dynamics, major dynamics driving our GPU success in the cloud. And then the second has to do with the fact that more and more of companies are using high-performance computing to drive their business. Some companies call it big data analytics, some you then refer to machine learning to understand what is happening to the dynamics of their business. High-performance computing is more is more important in enterprise than ever. Those two dynamic trends \u2013 and then maybe if I could just add the last one, is enterprise virtualization. Our GPUs on GRID makes it possible for you to virtualize your enterprise beyond the walls of the datacenter and all the way out to the fringe where the clients are. We could virtualize very, very compute intensive PC applications for the very first time. And so these three dynamics are really important to the future of our datacenter and cloud business, and as those continue to grow, our business will become increasingly less seasonal, if you will.\nRajvindra Gill - Needham & Company: That was helpful. And just my follow-up, to your point about the enterprise and the virtualization that you're seeing there, your design engagements with GRID are accelerating pretty rapidly and that appears to continue as the enterprises begin to realize the leverage that they can get from cloud-based visual computing. You talked in the past about the installed base being around over 500 million units. Can you talk a little bit about how systematically you're going to be able to kind of convert that installed base to a virtualized platform?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Good question. The most important partners, number one, starts with the hypervisor companies, the companies that build the core of virtualization. Of course VMware is a very important part of that, Microsoft is, Citrix is. I think it was at GTC, I guess it's in May, VMware was on stage with me to announce that they were adopting GRID, integrating GRID into ESX, and enabling virtual GPUs for their hypervisor stack. I'm anxiously waiting for them to go to beta, and so let's watch this space. I think that that has probably the single greatest near-term turbocharger to the GRID business. Beyond that, the ecosystem partners that we will go to market with are all the OEMs. They have the largest sales forces in the world and they are engaging enterprises from financial services to government to education to industry, and those sales forces are being trained on a constant basis and enabling OEMs to be able to take GRID to market as a very big part of the overall strategy. We now have every single OEM in the world supporting us. There are some 70, 80 servers that have been certified and qualified for GRID. OEMs from HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Hitachi and Fujitsu and just every OEM in every corner of the world has been enthusiastic supporters of GRID, and partnering with VMware and partnering with Citrix and partnering with Microsoft over time, that's how we're going to convert and virtualize all of the enterprises around the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Congratulations on the strong results. If I could, Jen-Hsun, dig into GRID just a little bit more, in the past you guys gave out a number for the number of engagements that you were tracking. I believe last quarter it was 600. Just to have a like-for-like, what is that number this quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We stopped mentioning it because the numbers were getting kind of large and maybe we just got kind of bored talking about it, but it's almost 1,000, Doug. I appreciate you asking.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Terrific, that's great to hear. If I could, one of the areas that I believe one of your competitors hit a speed bump on was the fact that GPUs were being used for cryptocurrency algorithms. Is this a market that you view as something that NVIDIA should be servicing, are you targeting your products at that and is it something that we should take into our thinking?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There are several things about that event that's really interesting. First, the fact that you could run an arbitrary and newly developed cryptocurrency algorithm on a GPU says something about the programmability of a GPU now. That's one of the things that \u2013 of course cryptology, cryptography is very important, of course encryption and decryption for security long-term will be very important, and GPUs will increasingly become important in the development of those algorithms. However, we really didn't benefit very much from people who were doing I guess bitcoin mining, and the reason for that is because if it's just one application, if it's somebody who is using that one application, they don't really care about the gaming experience, they didn't buy the platform for gaming, they didn't buy the platform for workstations or design, I would say that NVIDIA GPUs are not the most performance per dollar efficient in the market. As a component, if you will, as a commodity component, we're not the most competitive in that they. And maybe that was a blessing, maybe it wasn't, but I think in the final analysis I don't think we were particularly the best choice for somebody who would like to bitcoin mine. When they were done, they resold the graphics cards in the marketplace, and I guess in a lot of ways I'm kind of happy that that didn't happen to us.\nDoug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great, I appreciate the color there. My last one for you is really having to do with sort of the structure of the Company. You've been reliant on a single source for your foundry since inception. You're pretty much at a scale now that might make you say, we really should have a second source supplier here. Is there some sort of a catalyst that makes you or some level at which you feel you really do need to bring on a second supplier of wafers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We look at every foundry that's available in the world and there aren't that many that is competitive enough to be able to earn our business. So we competitively look at every single opportunity every single time. We've been fortunate to partner with GSMC for a very long time, they are a fantastic, fantastic partner, they continue to be, and quite frankly we've been well-served by that partnership. But we look at the competitive landscape on a node by node basis. And so, we have our eyes wide open and we keep all of our partners as competitive as they can be.\nChris Evenden: Thanks, Doug. Thanks everyone. We look forward to talking to you next time on our Q3 earnings call. Thanks Colin.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, our Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call to a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one initial question with one follow-up. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s call is being web cast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website and is also being recorded. A replay of the conference call will be available via telephone until May 15, 2014, and the web cast will be available for replay until our conference call to discuss our financial results for our second quarter of fiscal 2015.

Unless otherwise noted, all references to market research and market share numbers throughout the call come from Mercury Research or Jon Peddie Research. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our financial release, which is posted on our website. We reported our core financials on Tuesday following the inadvertent distribution of information to about 100 individuals. Therefore, we felt that the most prudent course was to release our financial results earlier than planned. Let\u2019s begin with today\u2019s call. Revenue was $1.1 billion, up 16% year-on-year and significantly higher than our outlook. EPS was up 85% year-on-year driven by the outstanding performance PC gaming supported by growth in Tesla, Quadro GRID, and in Tegra. Desktop and notebook PC gaming delivered exceptional year-over-year growth as gamers continued to buy high-end GPUs to play the latest PC games. In February, we lost our first generation Maxwell GPU, delivering the most power-efficient GPU ever. The GeForce GTX 750 series starts at $99 and targets the entry PC gamer. It\u2019s received a great reception among PC review sites, it\u2019s in full production, and demand is strong in all regions. At the very high end, we announced our newest flagship GPU, the GeForce GTX TITAN Z. This is the highest performance graphics card we have ever designed. TITAN Z will please both PC enthusiasts and CUDA developers and will be available in Q2. Notebook gaming has grown 51% CAGR for the past three years. Building on our gaming notebook momentum, we\u2019ve also launched a new family of notebook gaming GPUs, including the first based on the Maxwell architecture. The performance, battery life, and thin form factors of these notebooks have built a great deal of excitement in the end market. Products are shipping now and will be available from every major OEM this quarter. Our workstation business had another solid quarter and we now have the highest market share level since 2010. The big event of the quarter was our GPU Technology Conference. This year\u2019s was the most successful ever, with over 3,500 guests and 550 talks, both metrics up over 25% on the previous year. We use it as a platform to make major announcements for our data center GPU businesses, Tesla and GRID. The press published over 1,000 articles on the event and our blog recorded over 305,000 views. Jen-Hsun gave a vivid demonstration of the power of GPU-based machine learning at GTC, noting that the technology is already in active use or being evaluated by many consumer Internet companies, including Netflix, Baidu, and Yandex. High performance computing has driven the first phase of Tesla growth and we expect that growth to continue. And now we are seeing big data analytics further drive Telsa growth. In related news, IBM announced that it would incorporate our NVLink interconnect technology in its future POWER8 CPUs. The POWER CPU is poised to become a mainstream CPU through the OpenPOWER Foundation. Through the Foundation, IBM has opened up POWER as a licensable call and is enabling other server manufacturers to build systems around it. Google and NVIDIA are co-founding members of the OpenPOWER Consortium. IBM hosted over 9,000 attendees at its Impact Business and IT Conference in April, and demonstrated GPU acceleration working in the IBM Java framework on a Hadoop based analytics problem. With new product announcements from HP, Dell, IBM, and Cisco, the world\u2019s top three servers according to Gartner\u2019s server report the HP DL380p, Dell 720, and IBM x3650 are all now available with NVIDIA Enterprise GPU. And NVIDIA GRID is now available in more than 50 server platforms from 18 OEMs or ODMs. GRID trials continue to grow rapidly. We\u2019re now nearly 600 worldwide, up over 35% on last quarter. We\u2019ve also seen a 25% increase in the number of boards sold over the previous quarter. That\u2019s a 200% increase from the same quarter a year-ago. Many of the trials announced are turning into sizable pilots and many of those are in big blue chip and government accounts. Further accelerating growth is the news from GTC that Vmware ESX will soon fully support virtual GPUs. Much of the prior interest had been generated on the Citrix platform and ESX had only supported GPU pass-through, which meant one GPU per user. Supporting a vGPU means, it can now translate that GPU and share between users. We are already seeing ESX sites start evaluating grids today in the expectation that they\u2019ll add vGPU as soon as it\u2019s available, probably supporting both Citrix and VMware is an important step in the evolution of this business. Shifting away from enterprise for a moment, Tegra showed its third consecutive quarter of growth powered by strength in automotive. Audi launched its Tegra-powered A3 in the U.S. this quarter, and we\u2019re fueling the ecosystem with Jetson TK1, a development platform aimed at automotive, embedded and robotics applications. In a sign of the level of interest, these are selling as fast as we can make them. I\u2019ll close now by circling back to GTC. With talks on subjects from astrophysics to animation, from Quantum chemistry to big data analytics, GTC is a window into the company that NVIDIA is becoming. We invented the GPU for gamers, but we\u2019ve evolved the GPU well beyond consumer graphics. While we remain singularly focused on visual computing, our reach today spans consumer, scientific, and enterprise computing. And through innovation, we have created growth drivers in each of the PC, mobile, and cloud computing platforms. And with that, I would like to hand over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress: Thanks, Chris. Hello, everyone. Let me provide some details on the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year and down 4% from Q4. Revenue was above our outlook for the quarter, reflecting continued strength in GeForce GTX, desktop, and notebook GPU sales. The GPU business grew year-over-year to $898 million, up 14%. High end GeForce GTX GPUs for desktop and notebooks grew 57% fueled by continued demand for gaming GPUs and the newly released GeForce GTX 750 series, our first Maxwell based GPUs. Desktop GPU demand was strong in all key markets. The notebook market has contracted, however, high-end notebook GPU volume grew substantially, reflecting continued demand for mobile solutions for high performance gaming. Quadro revenue increased from both OEM desktop and mobile workstation. GRID sales were up strongly from the prior years initial quarter of sales. Tesla for high performance computing was up, as large commitments comprised an increasing percentage of the business. Our footprint in the data center is increasing as Tesla and GRID generate revenue from compute acceleration opportunities, VDI deployments and streaming gaming. The GPU business declined 5% sequentially. GeForce GTX GPU sales for the gaming segment grew from Q4, offset by a seasonal decline in the desktop and notebook market. The Tegra processor business grew 35% from a year ago, led by increased volumes for mobile and auto infotainment systems. Increased Tegra mobile sales were driven by strong growth in smartphone SOCs and the auto business grew more than 60%from prior year. The Tegra processor segment grew 6% from Q4 reflecting its third quarter of sequential growth. Moving to gross margins, GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, up from 54.1% in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.1%, up 50 basis points year-over-year and up 135 basis points sequentially. These margins were better than our outlook, helped by a richer mix of high-end desktop and notebook GPU as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margins continue to reflect the growth in volumes and stable average selling prices of higher margin, GeForce, GTX, GPUs and continued focus on cost. GAAP operating expenses for Q1 were $453 million, in line with our outlook and essentially flat from last quarters $452 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $411 million, about $2 million lower than our outlook. The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investments in both R&D and capital expenditures to enhance a return on invested capital. Operating expenses grew year-over-year due to employee additions in fiscal 2014 and employee compensation increases in related costs. Employee additions during the quarter were minimal. GAAP operating income was $151 million, up 83% from a year ago, reflecting strong revenue growth and contained operating expenses. Other income and expense included $11 million of interest expense associated with the convertible debt, $17 million from an investment gain, and $6 million of income from the investment portfolio. Going forward, our quarterly other income and expense should include our interest income from the investment portfolio of approximately $5 million plus $11 million of interest expense associated with our convertible debt. The GAAP effective tax rate was 16% inclusive of $7 million of discrete tax items. Our effective tax rate was higher than a year ago, due to the absence of the U.S. Federal R&D Tax credit. Now, turning to some key balance sheet items, early in Q1, we entered into a structured repurchase agreement for $500 million. We received an initial 21 million shares this quarter and we expect to settle the associated remaining repurchase shares in July with the conclusion of this agreement. Additionally, we paid $47 million in cash dividends in the first quarter. In the aggregate for the quarter, we executed a total of $547 million towards our first 2015 intended capital return of $1 billion to shareholders. Cash flows from operating activities was $151 million. Compared to the prior year\u2019s Q1, cash flow reflected higher accounts receivable from stronger revenue and inventory for new architecture builds offset by higher net income resulting from improved gross margin and contained operating expenses. Cash flow from operations was down from Q4 as the fourth quarter included the annual license payment from Intel. Our DSI of 72 days compares to 77 days in the prior year, as levels reflecting ramping production of our GeForce GTX 750 series. Free cash flow was $121 million in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million, capital expenditures were $29 lower than our outlook of $45 million. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Following our $1.1 billion first quarter, we expect revenue for the second quarter to be $1.1 billion plus or minus 2%. We expect seasonality in the consumer PC industry; however, we expect the strength of data center, CoD solutions, and mobility to provide growth sequentially. Our strategies and transformation into visual computing systems and solutions allows us to realize the continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming, as well as realize the growth in cloud data centers, super computers, professional design, and automobiles. Our GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 53.7% and our non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be approximately 54%. As we expect the volume of Tegra SOCs to be a larger percentage of the total mix of the units shipped in last quarter. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $457 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $414 million, nearly flat with current expense levels for Q1. The timing of some of our key product roadmap engineering costs is expected to be larger in Q2 than Q1, driving a slight increase quarter-over-quarter. We will continue to optimize other areas of spend to reach a first half goal of $425 million of non-GAAP operating expenses. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter and annual fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate excludes any discrete tax events that may occur. That completes our finished prepared remarks. I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Chris and the operator, so we can move to questions.\nChris Evenden:  Yes, let me hand it straight back to Jasmine. Jasmine, we\u2019ll take questions now. Thank you.\nMike A. Burton \u2013 Brean Capital LLC:  Hey, thanks for taking my question. Within the Tegra business, nice progress on the automotive front. I\u2019m hoping you can help us size that for you now. Is it bigger than smartphones and tablets and what\u2019s your expectations for those segments this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Hey, Mike. Let\u2019s see, there are three growth drivers in mobile for us. The way we see mobile is devices, automotive, and gaming. And this last quarter, devices is larger and automotive is the fastest growing. And I expect in the coming quarters, both will grow.\nMike A. Burton \u2013 Brean Capital LLC: Okay. And then traditionally Tegra carried lower gross margins on the overall business. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s different for the automotive vertical or should we still expect that to affect gross margin mix as that business continues to outperform going forward? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Automotive gross margins is higher than devices and I hope that both are very large over time.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJoe L. Moore \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Great, thank you. It looks like the client GPU business has been fairly volatile the last few quarters and you had kind of a downdraft for a couple quarters, it\u2019s been reasonably strong the last couple of quarters. I understand that there\u2019s an underlying growth trajectory under the gaming GPU business. Can you help us interpret that volatility and the sustainability of the year-over-year growth you are seeing now?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  Well, our consumer GPU business has two major components, one of them is consumer PCs and then the other is gaming. The gaming part of it is lower end volume, but it\u2019s much higher in ASP and much higher in gross margin. And my expectation is that the gaming PC will continue to be vibrant. It\u2019s not directly related to seasonality, it\u2019s a market that we understand very well that we have a strong position. And it\u2019s a platform \u2013 GeForce GTX is a platform where software intensity is quite high. The relative software that we bring to the platform is quite significant and whether it\u2019s algorithms that goes into our game works or it\u2019s the console that we call GeForce experience, but allows for optimal playable setting automatically to sharing your best moments with our friends on Twitch, capturing your favorite moments and turning into movies to share on Youtube. So that\u2019s our GeForce GTX business for gaming, there is a OEM part of it. The OEM part of it is subject to seasonality is subject to market share, but it\u2019s much lower in ASP is higher volumes, but substantially lower in ASP and of course substantially lower total gross profit contributions for the overall business. So those are the two major component and they just have different dynamics.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nDavid M. Wong \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  Thanks very much. You mentioned in your comments some large wins for Tesla. Should we expect a follow-up in Tesla revenue sometime this year once you fill some of these large projects?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  The overall data center, our data center strategy has two components. There\u2019s the Tesla GPU computing component and there\u2019s the GRID virtualization component. Overall, these two components, the data center part of our business grew substantially year-over-year and we\u2019re expecting the growth to accelerate, in fact. And the reason why it makes sense that they would accelerate is because both of these, enterprise virtualization and GPU computing, are addressing large market opportunities. And in both of these situations, we\u2019ve been cultivating the ecosystem for some time, and in the case of enterprise virtualization, we now have the support of Citrix and VMware. We now address the vast majority of the world\u2019s enterprises. Every enterprise wants to be virtualized from end-to-end and GRID allows all of the Enterprises to virtualize not just their data centers, but all of their applications, as well as PCs. And that has been a really difficult problem and finally, it\u2019s been solved by GRID. GPU computing, you know that our Tesla processor is a massively parallel processor and the problem that we solved with our platform called CUDA is making it easier, far, far easier for people to take large applications and paralyze it. And we\u2019ve been promoting this for quite sometime, as you know, and the adoption is accelerating. And so we\u2019re seeing the number of applications that come to CUDA increasing and accelerating. So I expect both of these product, these two platforms, Tesla and GRID, which represents our data center platforms, to continue to grow and in fact, accelerate its growth.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please proceed.\nCraig A. Ellis \u2013 B. Riley & Co. LLC:  Thank you taking the question. It looks like the Tegra business is starting to show some signs of consistent growth. Is that really the application diversity that we\u2019re starting to see with an increasing contribution with both embedded and automotive or is that really just product cycle dynamics? And how do we think about the implications for growth in that business as we think about what\u2019s historically been a very consumer seasonal business in the middle of the calendar year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot Craig. We\u2019ve seen three consecutive quarters of growth in Tegra and we\u2019re going to see quarters of growth coming. However, the reason why the growth is there has to do with the fact that we\u2019re focused on the segments where visual computing matters most. There are three segments that we focus on and visual computing are large contributions to all three of them. One is automotive. The amount of software, the amount of visual computing contribution we make to the automotive industry is quite significant. As we know, more and more cars want to be computerized and more and more of the functionality inside cars want to be computerized, whether it\u2019s the infotainment system, which was the first to start, but quite frankly, it\u2019s relatively simple for us. But the digital cluster and now the automatic driver assistance is much greater contributions from us. And so we\u2019ve got a foot in the door starting from 10 years ago and we\u2019ve been building our automotive computing platform ever since. So this is a business that is addressing a large market that is going through a transition to more computing capability and I think that we were first to this and we saw it coming from a long time ago and we were prepared for it, so that\u2019s one component. The second component is gaming. You know, that we\u2019ve been investing in bringing gaming to the Android platform. Android is the world\u2019s largest operating system platform now and we believe that over time, it will also be one of the world\u2019s largest gaming platforms. Just as we did with the PC industry before and bringing and cultivating the PC platform for gaming, we\u2019re doing the same for Android and we believe that our contribution there is quite significant. It\u2019s much more than just computer graphics. It\u2019s a deep knowledge of what it takes to make great games and all of the software technology that is included in making great games. And the third, we\u2019re just narrowly focused on devices where we can make a real contribution. Devices where performance matters, differentiation matters, and we partner with people that are looking for that performance differentiation and cool factor. And so those three segments are all doing fine and it\u2019s contributing to our growth.\nOperator: And the next question we have comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nVivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America:  Thank you for taking my question. Actually, one for Jen-Hsun and one for Colette. So Jen-Hsun, I\u2019m wondering what your share now is in gaming GPU versus AMD? And just overall, are you seeing any competitive response from AMD on both the client and the workstation graphic side, because they also sound very confident about gaining share, so I\u2019m wondering what kind of response you\u2019re seeing? And then maybe for Colette, the tax rate has consistently been below 20%. Is it better to just model, say, the current rate of 16% or do you think there will be a catch up quarter later in this fiscal year to get the full year to the 20% that you\u2019re guiding to? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, first of all, I think we\u2019re just going to have to let the number speak for itself. The gaming segment is, as you know, highly complicated from a perspective of software and architecture and the work that we do with game developers. People just know that when they buy a GeForce it\u2019s going to work great. And all of the software contribution we put on top of it, whether it\u2019s GameWorks or GeForce experience is just really significant. We have 30 million subscribers to GeForce experience and people use it, so that they can have the best gaming experience. And so, I think that our position in gaming is quite significant. It\u2019s a contribution of our performance of our GPUs and we have the best GPUs in the world. It\u2019s the most energy-efficient. We have the best software stack in the world and on top of that, we have GameWorks and GeForce experience that are deeply differentiated and available from no one in the world but us. And so I think our position in gaming is quite good and it\u2019s contributed to our continued growth. This isn\u2019t a one quarter thing, but you\u2019ve seen it coming for several years.\nColette M. Kress:  So Vivek, regarding your discussion on the overall tax rate, we are forecasting at this time 20%. This quarter, we were a little bit lower just based on discrete tax items that we do not forecast and are generally one-time items. Our forecast of 20% for the full year is associated with the fact that the U.S. R&D tax credit has not been renewed and that\u2019s where we\u2019re forecasting at this time. Should that change, as we have communicated last quarter that would bring our overall tax rate probably down to about 16%. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & CO. Please proceed.\nRaji S. Gill \u2013 Needham & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Colette, could you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes on the gross margin guidance? Margins are coming down about 90 basis points. I know you talked about Tegra representing a bigger part of the mix, but is there anything that\u2019s offsetting that and how should we look at gross margin profile over the long term? Thank you.\nColette M. Kress: Sure, thanks for the question. So as you look at what we guided and kind of adding together what we discussed in terms of the revenue guidance, as well as in the gross margin, we are expecting a larger amount of SOCs next quarter, both from a revenue side and the impact of that on the overall gross margin. We talked about the seasonal decline that we expect in the overall PC consumer market between our first quarter and the second quarter, but we do believe we will be able to offset with some of the higher data center GRID and other aspects that can contribute to our overall gross margin. So we feel pretty confident about the gross margin outlook that we provided for Q2. I tend to look at gross margin more on a yearly basis than looking at it from each single individual quarter, because we will have seasonality changes in terms of what we are overall shipping, but we should feel solid in terms of our focus on gross margins.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. \nDoug Freedman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets:  Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results, guys. I guess first, Jen-Hsun, could you give us a sense of what you\u2019re starting to see in terms of conversion rate, maybe time to money, for all of the GRID trials? It does seem like GRID is really ramping quite nicely in terms of the trials, but how should we think about those turning into time to money?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, most Enterprise trials last longer than three and take less than one year, and so I think it\u2019s somewhere in that range. Most Enterprises wouldn\u2019t engage in a trial unless they expect to deploy it and so something along the lines of six to nine months, nine months for the larger ones and six months for the smaller ones. Some of the complexities in the past has to do with the fact that many Enterprises had VMware in the data center and Citrix on the client. And we solved that problem recently. We announced with VMware that VMware ESX was going to support GRID fully integrated. And so now going forward, hopefully the number of circumstances where there\u2019s a hybrid model slowing down trials will disappear. I mean, at this point, we basically support the most important data center virtualization stack, as well as the most important client virtualization stack. And so, hopefully that results in faster trials, but something along the lines of six to nine months is not unexpected. The overall data center, GRID data center growth is arguably accelerating and I think, because it\u2019s such a small part of our business today, the fact that it\u2019s accelerating is not unexpected. If you take a look at our overall data center business, not only does it become sizeable, its growth is also accelerating, so I\u2019m excited to see that.\nOperator: And the next question we have comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nHarlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan:  Hi, good afternoon, and nice job on the Q1 execution. You talked about your overall consumer GPU segment being down sequentially in Q2, but within that, is your GPU gaming segment declining? And if so, is this maybe a pause ahead of a second half which is typically more driven by the introduction of new blockbuster games? And then just a quick follow-up for Colette, is the team still committed to keeping the Q3 and Q4 OpEx run rate at similar levels to what you\u2019re delivering in Q1 and Q2? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The seasonality of consumer PCs is pretty well understood and just as you were talking about before. Most of the gaming business is driven by games, actually. The question, are there fantastic games that are coming out and there are some pretty fantastic games coming out. Watch Dog is on its way out right now and it\u2019s a groundbreaking piece of entertainment and really excited about it. It\u2019s amazing how it looks. Titanfall is doing fantastic. It\u2019s already sold one million units in just a few weeks. It\u2019s, of course, Titanfall plays on a game console, but we also know that there are just more people on PCs than there are on game consoles. Whereas there\u2019s only a few million for this current generation game console, there are tens of millions of GeForce GTXs where Titanfall can be enjoyed. And so, our expectation is that Titanfall is going to continue to drive adoptions, they\u2019re going to do well. And you saw some of the results from Electronic Arts; they\u2019re doing fantastic with Titanfall. Some of these games will drive I guess games will the PC gaming part of it offsetting some of the seasonality of consumer PCs.\nColette Kress: And your second question related to the overall OpEx. I want to correct what I indicated in terms of the script here, in our Q1, our non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly below our overall estimates. And looking at our Q2, we will do $414 million. For the first half goal, our goal is to do $825 million, which is exactly half of a kind of a long-term run rate of about 16.50 in terms of non-GAAP operating expenses. OpEx will be the exact same every single quarter. It will change a little bit, but this time, we are still shooting for keeping with what we had of the overall amount as we guided in Q1 for the full year.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney with ABR. Please proceed.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy, LLC: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up, I just wanted to be sure I understood, Jen-Hsun, what you meant about the seasonality of the current quarter and the GPU business? So it sounds like, with seasonally weaker sales, both of PCs and also the timing of games that you\u2019re thinking that the consumer GPU business falls fairly broadly whether it\u2019s PC, GPUs, or gamer GPUs. Did I understand you correctly?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re modeling GeForce to be down sequentially, offset it by data center growth and mobile growth and that\u2019s what we guided.\nJoAnne Feeney \u2013 ABR Investment Strategy, LLC: Okay, perfect. Thanks for that clarification. And then on the professional side, you talked about Tesla really with pretty high hopes for growth and you talked about some programs doing well right now. I wanted to try to get some clarity on how much visibility you have in the supercomputer builds or your socket wins for the back half of the year, or is this more of a general statement about the underlying need for Tesla and super computers and more of a long-term description of your growth prospects. Do you have visibility into the second half or should we really be a little bit concerned about Tesla maybe taking a pause? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Tesla is growing. Tesla is not taking a pause. I think I was saying that I said several times that our data center business is growing. The combination of Tesla and GRID are growing. Tesla is growing and GRID is growing and the combination is growing. There\u2019s a couple reasons for that. I think high performance computing is really growing. Big data analytics is a big deal and big data analytics running on GPUs is just fantastic. Instead of a few processors we have thousands of processors, and big data is one of those problems that can be highly paralyzed. CUDA is perfect for it. We have multiple markets now, multiple industries where we are, where that we\u2019re exposed to, whether it\u2019s supercomputing, which tends to be large installation driven, there are many super computers that are small installations, hundreds of them around the world. But supercomputing is just one segment of our business, where large and seismic processing, we\u2019re large in medical imaging, we\u2019re large in higher Ed, where supercomputing is used to great deal. Internet Service Providers has become a quite exciting growth opportunity for us, as they use our GPUs for big data analytics, analyzing images or analyzing consumer preferences, helping you make choices. And so high performance computing to us is much more than super computing, even though super computing is there. And then on the other hand, the same servers that we\u2019ve created for Tesla are now used also for GRID. Those GPU servers that we have engineered with all of the OEMs perfectly fit GRID with a completely different software stack now makes it possible for their Enterprise salespeople to work with the customers on end-to-end enterprise virtualization. And so data center is a really exciting growth opportunity for us and its growth is accelerating.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James: Okay, thanks. And let me ask a couple of questions. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us some commentary about 28-nanometer availability as we go through the rest of the year and I have a follow-up, thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re having an okay time with availability. We work hard to align our needs with TSMC and we work very closely with them. We\u2019ve had some challenges in the past and every time we\u2019ve had challenges, it made our partnership deeper and the alignment of our supply and demand forecasting is really fantastic. We take it very, very seriously. They take it very seriously, and they do a great job for us.\nHans Mosesmann \u2013 Raymond James:  Okay, thanks. And as a follow-up, if you can just give us a quick update in terms of the competitive dynamic as you see the Tegra K1 hitting the market later this year and there is several or a bunch of new 64-bit based SOCs out there that are hitting the market? And so any color I think commentary it would be great.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Tegra K1 is about to be Tegra K1 season and I\u2019m pretty excited about Tegra K1. And we don\u2019t have anything to announce today, but hopefully, as we go into the second half, we\u2019ll see some pretty exciting products coming out with Tegra K1. TK1, as you know, is the most advanced GPU that\u2019s ever been built for mobile devices and it\u2019s taking the world\u2019s most advanced GPU, Kepler, and mobilizing it for the very first time. And so, the performance is really quite spectacular and I think your expectation would be that it would be a nice product. In terms of competition, there\u2019s lots of competition out there, but our focus with TK1 is automotive, gaming, and differentiated products, and customers who are looking for differentiated processors that can really bring some excitement to their devices. My expectation is TK1 is going to do great. You also know that TK1 is the world\u2019s first high performance 64-bit processor, and so I\u2019d expect TK1 to be, its one chip, two versions, as you know, and using exactly the same footprint, it could be a 32-bit or 64-bit. We\u2019re expecting to be in production long before the end of the year and be the first high performance 64-bit processor in the market.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Please proceed.\nC.J. Muse \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC:  Yes, good afternoon, thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, specific to GPU, curious how we should think about GeForce GTX 750 and 580 ramping in terms of the upgrade cycle through the year and how that will impact gross margin? And if you can discuss within that any other puts and takes, pluses or minuses that we should be thinking about for gross margin for GPU through the year.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I\u2019m not exactly sure how to answer that to your satisfaction because everything has been modeled in. We \u2013 I guess maybe the way to think about it is GTX750 is the best $99 gaming processor the world\u2019s ever built. The reviews when it came out and the reviews now are just fantastic. And so GTX750 is ramping up really, really nicely and it will be the entry level PC gaming card of choice. The margins are good. The margins for all GTX products are good. As I mentioned earlier, gaming is not only large in revenues, it\u2019s growing and the margins are good. And our position there is very, very strong. And so all of those dynamics have been factored in and we expect our gross margins to be stable throughout the year.\nOperator:  And the next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nAmbrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:  Thank you. Jen-Hsun, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, this is the first time you\u2019re calling out GRID as a specific driver within the segment, so what is the size of GRID today, is it tens of millions of dollars already?\nJen-Hsun Huang: On an annualized basis, it surely is. On an annualized basis, it surely is and on a quarterly basis, our enterprise GPU business is very large now. Where Tesla starts and ends and where GRID starts and ends is increasingly blurry. And the reason for that is, because it\u2019s one GPU with two different software stacks. Tesla has a software stack that\u2019s intended for GPU computing and GRID is a GPU stack that is intended for graphics and virtualization or virtualized graphics, but the processor is exactly the same. And so increasingly, I think it will be hard to discern, that\u2019s kind of why I put them together. Most data centers that we\u2019re working with include both Tesla and GRID. They use Tesla for their high performance computing work where they\u2019re doing big data analytics and they will use GRID for remote graphics, remote SAS for example, and maybe there\u2019s a graphics application they would like to provide a SAS or maybe they would like to deliver DAS, which is desktop as a service over to cloud, or they would like to provide that within the walls of the enterprise. And so all of these are contributing to our growth and I\u2019ve been talking about GRID now for about a couple years and this is an initiative we\u2019ve been working on for sometime. I think in general, the way to think about it is this and most of the topics that we\u2019ve been talking about today centers around two different areas, maybe three. The two areas, first, is we invented ways for us to extend our reach of computer graphics, our reach of GPUs, into mobile and cloud, and mobile is Tegra, and cloud is GRID and Tesla. And both of those initiatives are now starting to grow and grow nicely. And then probably the third thing \u2013the third commentary that I\u2019ve made consistently throughout the day is that visual computing is just more important than ever. And so I think that our GPU business in the PC driven by PC gaming is a growth business. Our mobile business has three segments. We see mobile as more than phones. It is auto, it\u2019s gaming, it\u2019s devices, and that\u2019s growing. It\u2019s been growing for three consecutive quarters and we\u2019re also expecting it to grow in the foreseeable future. And the third is data centers and cloud. Tesla and GRID are really unique products, very, very software intensive, addressing very large opportunities and we\u2019re seeing growth of vibrant and growing.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital:  Thanks very much for taking the question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blain. So just looking at the Tegra business and some specifics, in the past you\u2019ve said that you thought autos would double this year and then double again. Does that still hold or given the particularly strong performance this quarter, would you revise those estimates upwards at all?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  It\u2019s roughly there.\nChris Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay, I guess given that then looking at this year \u2013 would you expect \u2013 you broke down Tegra into those three segments. Would you expect auto to be larger than the other two, what\u2019s your mix expectation for the overall year for the business?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don\u2019t\u2019 expect auto to be larger than the other two.\nChris Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay.\nJen-Hsun Huang: And but that\u2019s a commentary about how enthusiastic them about the other two segments.\nChris Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital: No that makes sense. I mean give the \u2013 do you think you can continue that given the kind of torrid pace of growth you\u2019re expecting from the auto business into 2015 or?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes.\nChris Hemmelgarn \u2013 Barclays Capital: Excellent. And then my next follow-up. On the GPU side, I mean you didn\u2019t expose to be break it out, but given the increasing mix ongoing increased mix your higher end products, I\u2019m wondering ASP is continue to improve. Any feeling as to how long that \u2013 you continue to see ASP strength at some point is that level office both in our low end product mix stabilizes?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, the way to think about is, the way to think about that is \u2013 if you look at our ASP for GeForce, it is far, far, far lower than the price that most people pay for game console. And yet the PC is increasingly becoming you game console. And so if you look at where we are versus where we were, our GPU business is probably the only business that I know in semiconductors where ASPs has increased for 15 years. And I think the reason for that is, because it is the defining characteristic of a PC used for gaming. It is the defining component, is the defining technology inside a PC that\u2019s used for designing content, designing you car. And it is simply the most important element inside that computer for the applications that we are talking about, and those applications turned out to have been quite large. Video games is $100 billion industry here in a couple of years. And the production value of video games continued to increase, because the competition is so intense and people can\u2019t imagine playing the same production value game three years in a row. Everybody is looking for more and more and more. And so not only is it a large industry, it also computationally technologically intensive. So it\u2019s been driving our ASPs up and my expectation is that they will continue to do so. There are still many countries where video games is underexposed, partly because they just don\u2019t have broadband, it\u2019s surprising, but there are many large markets where broadband is simply not quite available yet. And without broadband you really can\u2019t enjoy the type of video games that we are talking about that. Every country will have broadband. And we are seeing fast, much, much faster than market, overall market growth rates in many countries Southeast Asia, India still very, very, fast growth. And so my expectation is that GeForce if we understand the business, which we think we do is really, really aligned to the gaming market. The gaming market is about to grow to be a much larger market and the GeForce GPU is the most important component inside the platform that\u2019s the most popular today, PCs. Thanks, Jasmine. We\u2019re ready for next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.\nKevin E. Cassidy \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the TK1, Jen-Hsun, you mentioned auto gaming and differentiated, but with it being a 64-bit and Kepler-based, is there any reason it couldn\u2019t be a GRID component also?\nJen-Hsun Huang:  No reason at all. I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in putting something like Tegra in micro servers, but one step at a time, one step at a time. I think the most important thing about micro servers and putting TK1 in the server is really the software stack. And the software stack we\u2019re building for GRID can very well eventually be used on top of Tegra as well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Caso \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group: Thank you. Can you follow-on for some of the earlier comments on operating expense? I understand that the target\u2019s for this year, but perhaps we could look a little longer out to 2015 and beyond. Generally, do you feel you\u2019re investing at the levels where you need to be, given the new initiatives that you\u2019re pursuing? I mean does it need to go up a little bit from here or is there opportunity for savings, how should we think of it?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, at the moment, we\u2019re properly invested in the initiatives that we\u2019re driving and we\u2019re seeing the returns on it. And GRID, as you can see, is growing; Tesla, as you can see, is growing; Tegra, as you can see, is growing. We are now as a company that had a large footprint in PCs, we now see our footprint growing in mobile platforms, as well as cloud platforms. And very, very soon I hope that they become a very large part of our business, and I think maybe your commentary is \u2013 your question is that wouldn\u2019t we love to invest more? And I think when the time comes, we would love to invest more. And the reason for that is because the work that we\u2019re doing, visual computing, in cloud, particularly, has quite a large potential. But we need to let the opportunities cultivate and I think that we\u2019re invested at the right proper level at the moment and we\u2019re staying very, very disciplined on it. And as soon as we grow into more and more markets, we\u2019ll invest more.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike McConnell with Pacific Crest Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael C. McConnell \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities LLC:  Thank you. Jen-Hsun, looking at just the growth rates on a year-over-year basis, just backing into your desktop business, it looks like you\u2019ve grown desktop 30% year-over-year or close to 30% the last two quarters. I understand there\u2019s new secular trends here with PC gaming, but there\u2019s also been a lot of talk last few quarters of pretty significant shortages at your competitor. Is this any concern of yours going forward that we get some reversion of the mean in terms of lower growth rates or do you think that this is sustainable?\nJen-Hsun Huang: There\u2019s a lot of product in the market and the fact that there\u2019s shortages says there\u2019s probably a lot of demand. And so, we\u2019re going to have to wait and see, but the way to think about it, Mike, is that the use of GPUs, the application of GPUs has now reached far beyond just gaming for consumer platforms. Sure, the number one application that consumes GPUs is games. It\u2019s $100 billion industry. It\u2019s larger than all of the media industries now and the growth in China is just enormous. And so, yes, it is a very large consumer, but you also need to know that people are making more movies. They\u2019re doing a lot more digital photo editing and there\u2019s a lot more computational digital media than ever and more people are using these computers, also, for developing parallel computing code on CUDA. And so, we\u2019re just seeing demand from a lot more applications than ever before and hopefully, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth.\nChris Evenden: Jasmine, we\u2019ll take one more question please.\nOperator: Perfect. We have one question last, sir. Our final question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please proceed.\nIan L. Ing \u2013 MKM Partners LLC: Thanks for putting me in. Can you talk about expectations for Android tablet SOCs? Should we think of it as typical seasonality the rest of the year or are you starting to see impact from Intel\u2019s contra-revenue programs?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, I can\u2019t comment on Intel\u2019s contra-revenue program, but we\u2019re more and more focused, as you guys know, on segments where visual computing is more important. And automotive, obviously, is very important to us that you used to have one application processor and in the future, you\u2019ll have maybe three, five. And so the number of processors, visual computing-focused processors in a car is growing quite rapidly. We\u2019re going to focus on developing the Android gaming market. We can make a real contribution. It\u2019s very, very hard and the work that we did over the last 15, 20 years in the PC industry, we are going to leverage a lot of that capability over to Android. The way to do that is with TK1 and so you\u2019re going to see, in the second half of the year, hopefully, a lot of exciting things that we\u2019ve been working on and then differentiated devices. And I hope that over time that becomes less of a focus for us and more of a focus on the two things that we\u2019ve been really, really investing in, which is automotive and gaming. And of course, many of these devices want to have gaming. Just like we invested in gaming for PCs, OEMs would like to use GeForce in their PCs not because that PC is necessarily used for gaming, but because it\u2019s bought by a gamer. And if your gamer knows that they want to play on GeForce and they know that GeForce helps them build best PCs, when they buy a laptop or one of these days when they buy a tablet or a phone, they might enjoy having a processor built by NVIDIA the way it\u2019s done for our PC business.\nChris Evenden: Well, thanks, everyone. We look forward to talking to you next time, on our next earnings call. Thank you. Good bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. Revenue reached a record in the fourth quarter totaling $1.4 billion, up 12% from a year earlier, up 7% sequentially, and above our outlook of $1.3 billion. Our full year revenue crossed above $5 billion to a record $5.01 billion, which was up 7% from the previous year. Quarterly growth was broad-based with expansion across each of our four market platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. Pacing games were our GTX gaming platform, our datacenter platform powered by deep learning, growing adoption and automotive. Viewed from a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 10% to $1.18 billion from an year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was up 40% to $157 million. NVIDIA's strategy remains sharply focused on creating platforms for our key markets. Our progress stemmed from our success in creating strong products that are targeted at growth markets. In Q4, our four market platforms contributed more than 85% of revenue, up from 78% a year earlier. Our growth platforms collectively increased 23% year-over-year. First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 25% year-on-year to $810 million, with good momentum carrying forward from the previous quarter. Maxwell-based GeForce GTX processers continue to lead our gaming growth, combined with growing anticipation for VR and the launch of holiday blockbuster games. The GeForce GTX 970 GPU stands as the world's most popular graphics card on the Steam gaming platform, and we continue to get strong traction with our GeForce GTX GPUs that power gaming notebooks. That includes the recently launched GTX 980 for notebooks, which has enabled a new category, enthusiast-class, VR-capable gaming notebooks. Excitement is growing around VR gaming, a key theme of last month's Consumer Electronics Show. We unveiled there our GeForce GTX VR-ready program to help gamers choose the best hardware for an immersive VR experience; and Oculus, which is now opened pre-orders for the Rift headsets, has exclusively certified GeForce GTX systems as being ready for VR. GeForce sales are driven by the launch of great gaming titles, and that again proved true this past holiday season. Fallout 4 was among the standout, recording more than $750 million in sales in its first 24 hours. Other major hits were Star Wars: Battlefront, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and Rainbow Six. We remain pleased with the continued success of GeForce experience, our gaming platform that automatically optimizes your PC settings for each game and downloads the greatest game-ready drivers. At the end of January, just two-and-a-half years after its introduction, GeForce Experience subscribers stood at 76 million, up 37% on the year. Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue increased 7% both sequentially and year-over-year to $203 million. The refresh cycle of workstations continued to improve during the quarter, driven in part by new workstation configurations in the market. While VR is often portrayed as a consumer play, we're also excited by its potential in enterprise, particularly in areas such as medicine, architecture, education and product design. Audi now has 20 virtual showrooms, with several hundred expected later this year, that let customers experience new models, customizing them real-time and take them for a virtual spin. In a very different application, a start-up called Surgical Theater uses flight simulator technology and multiple GPUs to allow surgeons to use VR to fly through a patient's anatomy and rehearse complicated procedures before making the first cut. In datacenter, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 18% sequentially to a record $97 million, up 10% year-on-year. This reflects the extraordinary rise of deep learning, a field in which we're now engaged with nearly 3,500 companies and organizations, as well as growth in the number of high-performance computing applications that are GPU-accelerated. During the quarter, we launched key products for this market; and a number of the partners provided updates to their own work in this area that underscores the central role of the accelerated GPU platform. A key development came during November's Supercomputing 2015 Conference with the release of the latest list of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers. It showed that more than 100 of these systems are now using accelerators. Two-thirds of these use NVIDIA accelerators, up 50% on the year. For hyperscale datacenters, we announced a platform that lets web services companies accelerate machine learning. It consists of both the NVIDIA Tesla M40, the most powerful accelerator designed for training deep neural networks; and the NVIDIA Tesla M4, a low-power, small form-factor accelerator for machine learning inference. Web services companies have enthusiastically embraced this trend. Shortly after our hyperscale announcement, Facebook disclosed that it will use the Tesla M40 to power its next-generation computing system for machine learning applications. And earlier this month, AliCloud, Alibaba's cloud computing business, announced it will work with us to promote China's first GPU-accelerated, cloud-based, high-performance computing platform. They joined other web services giants embracing GPUs for machine learning. During the quarter, Google outsourced its TensorFlow deep learning framework, which can be accelerated on GPUs. Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit was integrated with Azure's GPU Lab, enabling neural nets for speech recognition that are up to 10x faster than their predecessors. And IBM revealed that its Watson systems are now using GPUs. Progress continues to be made in our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphics-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. More than 100 companies are participating in an accelerated deployment program. Turning to automotive. Automotive revenue was a record $93 million, up 18% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year. One of the biggest stories at CES was the introduction of our NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 self-driving car platform, which utilizes artificial intelligence to address the profoundly complex challenge of autonomous driving. As many of you saw, DRIVE PX 2 is a supercomputing platform the size of a lunch box that processes 24 trillion deep learning operations a second and delivers 8 teraflops of processing power, equivalent to that of 150 MacBook Pros. It is a flexible platform that automotive developers can scale from one to four processors, and it can utilize passive cooling or integrate seamlessly with the water cooling systems of self-driving EVs. Capable of fusing data from cameras, lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors, it creates a full 360-degree understanding of what is happening around the vehicle. It localizes the vehicle on an HD map and it determines a safe path forward for using deep learning techniques. Volvo, well-known for its safety and reliability, will be the first to develop DRIVE PX 2, using it as the brain for its fleet of 100 self-driving cars to be publicly available next year in its hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. Just a couple of weeks ago, the first autonomous shuttle, the WEpod, incorporating our deep learning platform, took its inaugural trip on public roads in the Netherlands, where it can be summoned with a smartphone app. The DRIVE PX 2 launch generated enormous interest around the world from car makers, Tier 1 suppliers and others. We're now collaborating with more than 70 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies. Finally, our OEM and IP business was $198 million, up 3% sequentially, driven by the seasonal demand for notebooks. Now turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP quarterly gross margin was 56.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 57.2%, slightly above our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins increased from a year ago. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter was $539 million, inclusive of $34 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses, including litigation charges, were $445 million, in line with our outlook. For full fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.72 billion, including litigation costs. Our focus on rigorous execution and enhancing efficiencies enabled our core operating expenses to remain flat from fiscal 2015 as we focused on expanding operating margins. GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $252 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $356 million, up 26% from $283 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $207 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.35, including $0.04 of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Now turning to some key balance sheet items. At the end of Q4, our cash and marketable securities balance was just over $5 billion. During the quarter, we paid $62 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.3 million shares returned. As a result, we've returned to shareholders an aggregate of $800 million in fiscal 2016, meeting our intention we communicated at the start of the fiscal year. Over the past four years, we've returned more than $3 billion to shareholders, representing 98% of our free cash flow. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, our intention is to return $1 billion in fiscal year of 2017 through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal year 2016, revenue reached a record $5 billion, up 7%. Our growth platforms increased 26% year-on-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 56.8%, up 100 basis points on the year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 18% to $1.13 billion, with operating margin expansion of more than 200 basis points to 22.5%. Non-GAAP EPS grew 18%. Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming remains strong; and eSports, VR and new exciting gamings were lifted further. GPU-accelerated datacenters are expanding in both HPC and cloud, driven by the growth of deep learning. And autonomous driving continues to move forward. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 to be $1.26 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.2% and 57.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 19%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details, including the CFO Commentary and revenue by market platforms, are available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. We ask you that you limit your questions to just two. Ash, would you please poll for questions at this time?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the very good growth and execution. My first question, Jen-Hsun, is on the gaming segment. For the last two years it's grown at over 30% a year. I don't know if many other multi-billion-dollar businesses in semis that are growing at this pace. The question really is how sustainable is this growth? I understand the drivers, but could you help us ballpark that going forward over the next two years, three years, do you think of this as a 10%, 15%, 5% growth opportunity? Any guidance there would be extremely helpful.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Vivek. First of all, I think you captured the essence of it in your question. GeForce is really not a chip business anymore; it's really a gaming platform business. And when you think about it from a gaming platform business, it has to be thought of in the context of the whole gaming ecosystem and the gaming industry. It's $100 billion large. And when you think about it that way and you drive the business that way and you create value that way, I think the prospects for our growth there is still quite significant. There's several different ways that we can grow with the market. First of all, when we introduced new game platforms and this year \u2013 the last couple of years, we've introduced Maxwell; it's the most successful gaming platform we've ever introduced. The install base of about 100 million GeForce gamers in the world has an opportunity to upgrade to a new platform. Another reason why we can grow is because the production value continues to increase; the graphics richness continues to increase. And we do that by inspiring the industry, providing a technology that helps it include our technology in a much easier way; and the way that we do that is called GameWorks. All of the physics simulations, all of the visual simulations, all the lighting simulations and all of the things that make games beautiful today are easy to include by just supporting GameWorks; and it's been an enormous success for us. And, of course, the developing countries are still doing incredibly well. There are many countries around the world that are just starting to get into PC gaming. Southeast Asia is growing incredibly. And then not to mention that gaming is no longer just gaming. Gaming is all about sports now. But we're starting to see a new culture, a new dynamic in gaming even beyond that. It's really becoming a platform by which people could share and a platform by which they could artistically express themselves. And if you look at some of these games today, it's something that you enjoy well beyond just playing the game. You use the game as an editor to tell stories. And so these games, like GTA 5, it's just fantastic for telling stories. And so you can see now that the gaming platform's going beyond games, it's going beyond sports; and now it's a creative platform. And so there's just all these wonderful ways that the game industry has continued to be vibrant; and my sense is that we're going to continue to grow with it.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And as a follow-up, Jen-Hsun, on your automotive business. As you move from infotainment systems that are graphics-intensive to more advanced computing systems, do you think it changes the competitive environment? And what I'm referring to is we have seen Qualcomm and others enter the segment and they are making the case that they can integrate a lot of different piece parts and tie that to their processor. And I'm trying to draw a parallel with what you had on the smartphone side where you were specializing in one part, but others could integrate other parts and become more successful. Is there going to be a similar situation in auto? Or do you think that we should read it in a different way as to how your competitive situation can evolve in autos as computing becomes a bigger part of the application?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we have to be mindful of competition. And there's a lot of different ways to compete, there's a lot of different ways to bring value; and surely what you described is one way to compete. Those aren't really the segments in the market that we'll address. The way that we think about infotainment is there are segments of the infotainment market, surely the parts of the market that we serve incredibly well. The richness of the displays, the number of displays and how the displays are going be used in the coming years are going to continue to expand. You know the display costs are coming down and OLED displays are become cheaper. There's so many different ways to bring visualization into the car to enhance the driving experience. You can also imagine how artificial intelligence technology could change the way infotainment systems are even used. And one of our strategies, of course, is to bring artificial intelligence technology to enhance how the driver communicates with the car. And so there's all kinds of new technologies that we're going deploy into the infotainment system, leveraging our expertise in deep learning. The part of the market that you're starting to talk about is the segment of the market that we really introduced into the marketplace, which is the autonomous driving computer. We started talking about it several years ago, I think it was like three years at CES, when I introduced the DRIVE PX, where we imagined that in the future a car would also have a supercomputer inside that is powered by deep learning, that's powered by artificial intelligence. And that takes in the sensor input continuously from the car, what's surrounding the car and infer from it the appropriate thing to do. That vision three years ago seemed a little bit, if you will, outer space. But I think that it is very clear now that the technology that we're bringing to bear, deep learning, is really the best approach for helping car companies go beyond ADAS, which is going be a commodity in the coming years as you can imagine, go beyond ADAS and move towards assisted driving to full autonomous driving. And so I think that we can add a lot of value there. PX 2 was really invented to allow OEMs to scale that entire range from assisted driving, all the way to fully-assisted driving. And that's one of the reasons why we can support one chip all the way up to four chips, from passive cooling all the way up to integrating directly into the self-driving EV water cooling system that's quite available for most EV cars with liquid cooling. And so I think that our strategy there is going to work out quite well. We add a lot of value. It's very algorithm-rich, it's very software-rich; and I think our DRIVE PX platform is really quite state-of-the-art.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, on the TDS business \u2013 I'm sorry, the Tegra Development Services \u2013 you noted that that was an important driver of growth. And can you give us a little bit more color on that business? How big is that? What end markets are you working with? What are you helping customers do? Hi. Can you hear me?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, I'm just trying to figure out what your question was. Let me see. I guess I'd be reluctant to announce anything today, but there are semi-custom businesses that people need our help on. And we're open for business to help select partners develop proprietary systems that leverages the wealth of technologies that we have, whether it's in visual computing or deep learning or supercomputing, so that we can create systems and products and services that the world has never had before. And so that's an area that I think is of interest to us; and it's an area that we'll likely see a lot more success in the future. But there's not much to really announce today.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And the gross margins \u2013 second question on the gross margins \u2013 they've gone over the last three years from the low-50%s and pushing through 57% now. At what point do these asymptote out? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I appreciate that question. There are lot of moving parts in our gross margins business \u2013 gross margins. Of course, our enterprise businesses is richer in gross margins; our consumer business tends to be lower in gross margins. At the highest level, the way I would think of our company's gross margins is really the nature of our business model is changing. And if you think about our business model a long time ago, it used to be a chip business, but today we're really a differentiated specialty platform business. And what I mean by platform business is it's, of course, the chips, the systems, but it's largely about the differentiated software that's on top of it. And so, increasingly, you're going to find that our businesses is software-rich, it's services rich. And if that's the case, one would think that our business model would become increasingly of that nature; and I think you're just seeing the reflection of that. As our company continues to move towards our differentiated platforms, which was, call it, 50% just a few years ago and it's now reaching some 80% now; as we move into these specialty differentiated platforms, the software content is just much, much higher. And our customers who work with us are not buying chips for their systems, for their commodity systems, but they're looking for a platform to solve a particular problem. And the problems that we help to solve, the solution that we bring to bear, is so high-valued that I think that increasingly you should expect that \u2013 well, you should hope and I hope myself \u2013 that our gross margins continue to move along with the change in our business model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, and congratulations guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us an update on the high-performance compute side of the business? How will Pascal compare to the upcoming other solutions in the market and specifically Intel's Knights Landing? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Hans, thank you. Our high-performance computing business uses an architecture we call accelerated computing. Accelerated computing is a model of computing that we invented almost 10 years ago, and it's a very unique way of doing computing and it takes advantage of the strength of the CPU, as well as the advantage of the world's most parallel processor called the GPU. It is very software-intensive, it's very mathematics-intensive, it's very algorithm-intensive. And it's a problem that when applied to some verticals can accelerate computing dramatically. We see accelerations of 5x, 10x, 20x quite normally, quite regularly. And the way that you translate this benefit to a customer is that it reduces their costs. Instead of building a supercomputer that may cost as much as $500 million, the supercomputer would be the world's best at $100 million. That's a pretty substantial reduction in expenses. The power bill that they would spend on a regular basis would be dramatically reduced. And so datacenters and supercomputing centers save an enormous amount of money. On the other hand, the researchers see a substantial boost in their application throughput. And so that's one of the reasons why accelerated computing is doing really well. We're seeing a couple of different drivers for accelerated computing and high-performance computing, our datacenter business. Accelerated computing itself for supercomputing applications, whether it's weather simulation or molecular dynamics simulation, continues to grow. But the big killer app that we're starting to see \u2013 and we've been cultivating this for several years now and it's now really turning the corner and going into turbocharge in growth \u2013 is deep learning. Almost in every field of science, as well as for web services companies, artificial intelligence helps them wade through, comb through just massive mounds and oceans of data to discover insight. And so deep learning and using artificial intelligence technology across all fields of science \u2013 I'm super excited about the work that's going be done in medicine \u2013 it's really going to see some great adoption. I think we mentioned that in just a couple years ago, we had 100 companies working with us in the area of deep learning and now it's ballooned to 3,500. That's quite a large scale growth. And it's in industries, all the way from life sciences to supercomputing of course, to web services of course, to even industrial. And the application for industrial would be Internet of Things. All of these sensors all around the world collecting data needs artificial intelligence software, deep learning software to reveal insight. In terms of our positioning relative to the competition, this is an area that we have a real advantage; and we have a real advantage for several reasons. The incremental cost to our company \u2013 the incremental cost of engineering, accelerated computing \u2013 into our normal course of running our GPU business, GeForce business is incremental. And so the system, the entire system, the 10,000 people in our company can quite easily, if you will, continue this rhythm \u2013 and quite a high velocity rhythm \u2013 of bringing on new GPUs that are great for accelerated computing and great for gaming, of course, and great for workstations in its natural course of doing work. This is not adjunct business to us; this is our core business. And at the core that is our fundamental advantage. It's a singular motion, singular execution, singular investment, singular architecture, incredibly leveraged. And the execution, as a result, is just absolutely flawless. And so I think in the end that's our situation.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava of BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nTing Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to follow-up on your Tesla business. I think in the recent earnings call Cray actually iterated its expectation of over 50% of its $825 million revenue in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. And I think they cite its drivers one of the three supercomputers actually has used Pascal. So how should we think about the benefit to your Tesla business?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Cray is a very important partner of ours. And the thing that's really exciting for me is to see them transition their business \u2013 not transition, but transform their business from one that is really focused on supercomputing centers to one that is also working on big data. This this an area where we can add a lot of value to them. We have a lot of expertise in this area. And as they continue to evolve their market footprint beyond supercomputing centers and now into large enterprises, I think they could find a lot of success. And so they're seeing a lot of success in this area. Big data analytics is \u2013 we're square in their bulls eye and I'm quite excited for them in the work that they're doing there. And so they're a good customer for us, a great partner of ours; and I'm excited to see their ongoing success. The thing that we're all seeing is that big data analytics \u2013 the most powerful weapon for big data analytics has recently been discovered. Deep learning is just a fantastic new computing model. It is able to discover insight that is provably now superhuman. Its dimensionality in thinking through data is unrivaled than any approach that we've learned in the past. And now that's one of the reasons why industries all over the world, from life sciences, to industry, to manufacturing, to supercomputing, are jumping onto deep learning bandwagon. And so I think their adoption of Tesla, the NVIDIA GPU, is going to be quite a successful one.\nTing Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up, I think you seem to spend about $90 million in legal expense. And how should we think about in fiscal 2017? And also, can you give us an update where you are in the cases of Qualcomm and Samsung?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, just as a backdrop, we litigated against Samsung last year and the expenses was what you were referring to. At the core of it, fundamentally philosophically we believe that it is inappropriate and it's wrong for Samsung to use NVIDIA's technology, technology that has cost us billions of dollars to invent, and to use it without compensating us. At the core, I just think that's just wrong. And we think it's wrong; and that's the reason why we decided to litigate \u2013 to sue Samsung. The ITC has passed its early decisions, and we disagree with them. We're disappointed by them. It is unfortunate that the business courts couldn't see through the obviously complex data associated with the technology. But we're disappointed by it. We've appealed for a review. And hopefully in the near term, we'll discover what the ITC will do. Bu t I still believe that it was the wrong thing to for Samsung to use technology that companies who are specialized in these fields invent and to use it without compensation. And I'm disappointed with the decision from the ITC, but so be it. Next year, we have plenty of things to go invest in and we have plenty of growth drivers. You know that we have four powerful growth drivers in our company: gaming is one, VR is another, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars. And we have plenty of growth drivers to go focus our company on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the auto side. Trying to get my arms around how we should think about growth here in calendar 2016 off the 75% growth in 2015. I guess, if you could kind of parse between your backlog for infotainment, your outlook there, as well as what kind of ramp you see with the product development contracts on the ADAS side?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So two questions there. First of all, our pipeline. We've talked about our pipeline several times. We've shipped probably 5 million, 6 million cars. We have another 20 million, 25 million cars to ship in our pipeline. And so these are design wins that took quite a few years to have won and quite a few years of engineering to ramp into production. So we have a pretty good visibility of the pipeline and the opportunities that are ahead of us. Probably there's some market dynamics that's helpful to some of the design wins, the segments that we serve. Of course, at the time, a long time ago, it's hard to tell, but it's very clear now that the computerization of cars is a highly desirable end user feature. And the customers, the partners that we worked with, the car companies we worked with, to computerize their cars, whether it's Audi or Tesla whose cars are heavily computerized, their growth prospects in the coming years are quite good. And so I think that that's one that we have a clear view of the pipeline, and I think the mega trends of the computerization of cars is in our favor. Now you mentioned \u2013 secondarily, we introduced this platform called DRIVE PX. It's our autonomous driving car computer platform. And the recent success of ADAS has really inspired just about every car company in the world to look beyond ADAS. And what's beyond ADAS is self-driving cars. And it could be partially assisted, it could be mostly assisted and it could be completely assisted. And in each one of those levels of autonomy, a different amount of computation would have to be deployed. And we've created a scalable architecture that allows car companies to develop cars that are partially assisted, all the way to completely assisted. We're working with quite a large number of customers now, car companies, start-up companies, companies that are largely cloud-based and have an enormous amount of data that they could transform into an automotive service, transportation as a service. And so we're working with a whole lot of different types of companies, and I think this is going to be an area of quite a significant industrial revolution; and arguably quite a gigantic society good in the long-term. So anyways we're working on a lot of projects there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one for you, if I could. In terms of the deep learning, machine learning opportunity, I was wondering if you could help quantify sort of the longer-term silicon TAM for the opportunity both in datacenter and automotive? And I guess more of near-term, any thoughts on what kind of development revenues could be generated for these machine learning type platforms in the near-term?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thanks. I think part of the answer is I'm not sure. Part of the answer is I'm not sure. So with that as a disclaimer, let me tell you why I'm so enthusiastic about it. There are many problems that computer science has been trying to solve, which algorithmically is just impossible to solve. There's no known way of a human-described algorithm that completely captures the noisy and long tail of society. And it could be almost any problem. It could be weather-related product type problems, it could be market-related type problems, it could be all kinds of purchasing-related challenges and all kinds of data. It could be life sciences, as we know that the human body is not in a perfect condition all the time. There's that randomness that plays a role in understanding molecular science. And so there are so many different types of areas where there is no simple Newtonian physics equation that can describe the nature. And so in that particular case, using an enormous amount of data to train a neural net, to train software, to rewrite the software, if you will, using an enormous amount of computation is an pretty exciting computation model. I think this is a brand new computing model, one that is going to augment the traditional model of symbolics and computer programming. This is going to be a data-driven type of computing model. And in this particular case, GPU-accelerated computing is really quite ideal. And the computing model that we've invented some 10 years ago is really quite ideal. How big is it? I think that it could be quite significant. And we're starting to see, of course, the type of companies that are jumping on top of the deep learning bandwagon. They're great companies, from Google, to Facebook, to Baidu, to IBM, to Alibaba, to just about every hyperscale web services company in the world is jumping on this because they have enormous amounts of data and it has very, very long tails. And traditional segmentation is too contrived of a approach to find great insight. Now the companies with a great deal of web-based data, cloud-based data has already starting to engage in this area. They're starting to implement artificial intelligence into one application after another. And I think we've already heard them announce that it's very likely they'll put artificial intelligence into every single application they have. We're starting to see this sweep across industries. The automotive industry, of course, has the longest tail as the world is a very noisy place. And in order to create a car that can navigate through it, the long tail of a very complicated world has to be handled somehow. Writing software programs is just not going do it. And so using an ongoing, learning artificial intelligence network could be exactly the solution for it; life sciences, industries, manufacturing, supercomputing, financial services. I mean the list goes on and on and on, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm there. Before everybody can use deep learning, they have to train a network. And this is an area where we have a great deal of expertise. This year, as you know, we also announced our first hyperscale inferencing engine. It's our first end-to-end training-to-inferencing \u2013 inferencing is predictions \u2013 the application of the network. And so from training all the way to inferencing, we now have a complete architecture that is architecturally compatible. The Tesla M40 is for training and the Tesla M4 is for inferencing. The M4 is a little, tiny credit card-sized GPU, and very low powered, incredibly energy efficient; and you can connect it into just about any hyperscale data center in the world. And we're sampling customers now. The results are quite exciting. Customers are very enthusiastic about it. And I think we could dramatically reduce the cost of datacenters all over the world as they start to ramp up artificial intelligence in their everyday workload.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Appreciate that color, Jen-Hsun. And as a quick follow-up, I had one for Colette on the inventory levels. Colette, just given where inventories ended for the quarter \u2013 on a days and dollars basis it's roughly comparable to a number of quarters back when revenues were about 20% to 30% lower than where it is today. Is this a new level that the company can continue operating at just based on supply chain efficiencies? Or is this just sort of the seasonal volatility in this number or any other kind of average ASP of the products that you're carrying? Thanks.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Stephen, thanks so much for the question. Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they're definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platform. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners and definitely for what we need to ship going forward. So I don't think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single one quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline, as well as what customers need. But you're correct, it's probably at a fairly healthy low level at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi, Jen-Hsun. One question on deep learning. I was wondering if you could talk about relative opportunity sizes in training and inference part of the deep learning? Clearly, you have a strong position on the training side. I would love to hear your thoughts on the inference side. My understanding is there's a lot of custom chips are being built in the industry on the inferencing side. So I would love to get your color on what competition you will see on that front?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Here's my guess. I think long-term, training will be half of the overall market. And the reason for that is because training is so heavyweight. And in the long-term \u2013 well, not long-term, now, you're training your network constantly. You create a network, you want to improve this network as fast as you can because you have so much valuable data and so much insight that you can go after. And you deploy the network for inferencing which collects brand new data, and the world looks completely different to you. You now collect that data and you use that data to train your network. I think that network training is going to be a continuous basis and we're seeing that absolutely. Also, there are more types of networks. The types of networks that are being created, the rate of revolution, the rate of innovation of networks, network styles, network types, network configurations, network depths; it's happening every single week. I'm actually not exactly sure how you would design a custom chip for it, which explains why there are only two chips today that are successful in inferencing. One of them is the Intel Xeon and the other one is the Tesla M40 and M4. And so I think that the ability to adapt to new algorithms quickly is really quite vital as we go through the next several years of this artificial intelligence revolution. And there's just so much algorithms being developed; and I think you guys are reading about it constantly, new breakthroughs in AI, new breakthroughs in network design. At the moment, I just really don't know how someone would settle down and design a custom chip for it. And so I happen to believe that long-term artificial intelligence is not a chip. Artificial intelligence is a computing model; and computing model needs processors; and processors are programmable; and these programmable processors need to have rich software development environments around it, and these platforms needs to be available all over the world. And, today, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform is available in a PC, in a workstation, in a laptop, in the cloud, in a car, in robots, in embedded environments. And it's all exactly the same architecture. I think that that's really one of our advantages that we have the ability to be adaptable, programmable and yet we're available in literally every single computing platform form-factor you can imagine. And the accessibility of NVIDIA's architecture is literally global, worldwide and within reach for anybody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nRoss C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for letting me ask a question. One for either Jen-Hsun or Colette. In your first quarter guidance it looks like the down 10% has some seasonality to it, but you also have a lot of businesses that have secular trends behind them. So I was hoping that you could provide a little bit of color on kind of seasonality versus secular, or which of the drivers would be better or worse than that 10%, acknowledging also that you lose a week of business guiding into that April quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. First of all, I appreciate the question. I think, first of all, it's just the guidance; and it's our best view today, it's our most prudent view today. And as we know, although there are many things we know, the worlds' a very uncertain place. There's a few things that we do know. The gaming market is quite vibrant and it continues to be quite vibrant. We monitor it literally every day, every week; and we monitor it all over the world, and it remains quite vibrant. In the coming months there are some really, really wonderful games that are coming out that we think are going be spectacularly successful, whether it's The Division or Tomb Raider or \u2013 the list goes on. And so I think the gaming market appears to be quite vibrant. Our automotive business is vibrant. And the work that we're doing in self-driving is really gaining traction and captured the imagination of just about every car company around the world. Our deep learning work and supercomputing work, high-performance computing work is accelerating. And so in a lot of ways I understand where you're coming from, but we don't want to ignore seasonality. Q1 is Q1. And we recognize that the market is uncertain, and we'll see how it plays out. At the end of the quarter, we'll come and report it again.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on another solid quarter. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the install base and the upgrade opportunity in gaming. I think last call you quantified it as around three-quarters of the install base that really needs a more updated GTX processor. Given the 37% growth in the gaming business last year and the success of Maxwell, it actually does appear that you did drive some meaningful upgrade in the install base. So the question for you is, is there any updates to your views on where the install base sits at from an upgrade opportunity? And then the second question is do you get a sense that the cadence of these upgrades will be accelerating, given the advancements you and your gaming engine partners are bringing to the market every year?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Those are really good questions, and we monitor our install base pretty carefully. And currently in the install base, we basically have three architectures still in operation. We have the Maxwell architecture, and we have the Kepler architecture and we have the Tesla architecture. All of those \u2013 excuse me, the Fermi architecture. And those architectures are all running in the install base at the moment. We've managed to upgrade about a third of the install base. Meanwhile, it is the case that ASPs of our GPUs are going up because the graphics richness and the graphics production value is going up. The quality of games \u2013 because the market for games are so high, game developers can really create much, much more beautiful games and take the risk to do that. The developing markets are growing. The number of genres, like eSports, of games are growing. And so there's a lot of different growing vectors. And meanwhile, all of that is on top of our desire to upgrade our install base so that they can enjoy games the way that it ought to be enjoyed. And so I think there's still a fair amount of growth opportunity ahead of us; and we'll monitor it carefully and report it once a quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag with Macquarie Capital. You may proceed with your question.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. So Quadro grew for the first time I think in several quarters. Can you kind of describe what drove that growth and how we should think about the growth profile for the rest of this year? Is it possible that it could grow in the mid-single digits for all of 2017?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Deepon, thanks for the question. I was delighted myself. I'll just put that out there. We worked really hard to improve our Quadro business. The team works incredibly hard. We've invented a new technology for rendering called Iray. It's the world's first physically modeled photorealistic renderer that is accelerated by GPU. The result of it is really quite remarkable, and they continue to add new capabilities to it. We, this last quarter, also benefited from the enthusiasm and excitement around VR, and we have VR SDKs and collaborations with just about every ISV in the world that is working on VR. And so I think there's a lot of good reasons to be enthusiastic about Quadro. We don't believe for a moment that the design quality and design production value of movies, or games, or architecture or manufacturing will continue. We believe absolutely that's going to continue to improve in visual realism and the productivity of the engineers that are involved, the artists that are involved needs to continue to increase. And so we think that this is going to be a vibrant growth area ahead. I think that what drove recently the uptick are the OEMs refreshing workstation cycle, and I think we should enjoy some of that for the coming quarters. But I still think long-term the real opportunity, surely the market is there. We know that more and more of design and creativity is done digitally. So at the core, the market is there. The opportunity for us is to bring new forms of rendering, new forms of design. And as you could see, Iray is for rendering and VR is for interacting with the design. These types of capabilities require just an enormous amount of GPU capability. And I think at the core that's going to be our long-term growth drivers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJoe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in emerging markets, with a lot of macro concern about some of your end markets, notably China, and you guys keep putting up very good numbers. Can you sort of talk about that demand by geography and how you weigh the economic and currency risks over the course of this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. For some reason I still kind of tend to believe that what drives the gaming market is great games. And I think that there's some evidence that the continued release of great games and great production value games \u2013 the vibrancy of eSports, the fact that eSports is really not just for competition, but drives the dynamic of sharing and social. Those kind of factors continue to drive our gaming business. I'm quite enthusiastic about the developing markets. Southeast Asia, for one, is really starting to adopt PC gaming quite rapidly, and it is a market that is extremely underserved. India is a market that is extremely underserved. They are underserved because broadband Internet hasn't been available to those marketplaces until just recently. And there are surely demographics in these markets that would love to jump onto gaming. And who doesn't need a PC? And so almost every market develops around PCs quite rapidly. And so I think the way of enjoying games is so affordable by adding a GeForce GTX to a PC that you already own. It is the most affordable form of entertainment if you think about it that way. And most of eSports are free to play, anyhow, and so much of it is, anyhow. And so it's a wonderfully affordable way to enjoy entertainment. And so I think the South \u2013 Southeast Asia, India are really quite exciting developing markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed with your question.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, there's been a lot of, I guess, speculation about how the emergence of VR, headsets in particular, for gaming would drive your GPU business. I guess I'd just like to hear your perspective on a couple of things. One, obviously, it requires high-end and high-ASP GPUs to support some of these applications, so of the early adopters, maybe a sense of which of those folks might already own those type of GPUs and which ones might have to upgrade in the near term. And second, how VR might penetrate the eSports phenomenon over time and drive more of those upgrades into the higher-volume mainstream parts of the gaming market. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, there are really two questions in your question. They're both good. And one question is how do I feel about VR and its impact on gaming. The second part is how will VR impact our business. Let me just tell you the second part first. We don't \u2013 we don't \u2013 we're not forecasting and not assuming any upside in VR. However, there is no way, but good, that VR will bring to our business and we'll take it a day at a time and we believe that it's going be an exciting growth driver. We believe that it's going to be helpful to our high-end GPU business. But when the time comes, it'll be a nice bonus. And so we're going to run our business as if we don't count on it. However, obviously, we care very deeply about it because we think that the experience of VR is quite amazing. Anybody who's tried it is surprised how immersive it is, how it takes you away from where you are and into another world. You're really suspended in disbelief and it's as close to a holodeck as we've ever experienced. And so we believe strongly that VR is going to be fantastic for entertainment. It's going to be fantastic for games. We also believe that it's going to be fantastic for all of our Pro business. I wouldn't be surprised if the segment of our business that it helps the earliest may very well be our Professional business. And the reason for that is because there are many applications that are mission-critical. And even though the headsets are not free, it's quite affordable. And for people who have powerwalls and who use large displays, VR is actually an incredible cost reduction. And so almost anybody can now have a virtual reality cave which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anyone can now have a powerwall, which costs tens of thousands of dollars, and now for just a few hundred dollars, have all the benefits of that. And so I think that you could tell that I'm very enthusiastic about it. We're developing a lot of fresh technology and new enabling technology to make it possible. We're working with all of the market leaders to develop the market and cultivate the market. And then from a financial perspective, we'll just see how it plays out. And my sense is that it's going to be a really nice bonus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Hemmelgarn with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nChristopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on the good quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks a lot, Chris.\nChristopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, I guess, first of all, I wanted to \u2013 we've talked a lot about some of the really exciting businesses that have a lot of great growth prospects for you. I thought we'd look at, as well, some that have been a little more stagnant. And I was curious to your take of, for example, the OEM business. It looks like it may be finally stabilizing after declining. How do you look at that business in the coming fiscal year? Do you think it can even get back to growth or do you expect continued declines?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, my sense is that it will stabilize, and let me tell you why. Our OEM business is not about gaming because it's our Gaming business. And the OEMs are not about design because that's our Design business. But the thing that some OEMs do is they include our technology to differentiate a mainstream platform from a premium platform. And so by adding NVIDIA's technology, you turn a commodity PC into a premium PC. And the experience is better, the performance is better and everything just works. And so there's a real benefit in using it as a premium multimedia PC, if you will. And so we'll probably see continued interest in doing that. And we're delighted by that. We don't count on it, but we're delighted by it. And so my sense is that it will likely stabilize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Roland with FBR & Company. You may proceed with your question.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys, thanks for the question and great quarter. On...\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: How are you, Chris.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. Thanks. Speaking about your installed base briefly, can you guys share with us your view on GPU replacement rates, kind of how fast are they or how long are they now, and whether they're kind of shrinking or speeding up here? And also perhaps how they might differ by geography?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know that I have the precise \u2013 precise granularity by geography except for just a few countries, but let me address it overall. The installed base takes a couple of two years, three years to upgrade. And on the lower end, three years to four years. On the higher end, one year to two years. And so overall, I guess \u2013 because the lower end products are higher in volume, it would probably weigh the overall average to call it three-plus years. But the ASP, of course \u2013 if you look at it from an ASP perspective, it's a little bit different, it would probably drift up. The rate of upgrade appears to be increasing. And that might also explain that the ASP of the products can \u2013 the ASP of our overall portfolio increasing. I think the reason why it's increasing is because the size of the gaming market has now grown to a level that developers can take a fair amount of risk to add a rich content, rich production value in graphics, which they didn't used to be able to do. I mean, they now have the benefit of a large installed base of PlayStation and Xbox, Nintendo and PCs, that they could actually create content that is really, really quite beautiful and technologically rich, which drives up the adoption of higher-end GPUs because you need higher-end GPUs to process it. I think that's quite a significant factor. I think the other factor is that the game consoles, although nowhere near the performance level of our high-end GPUs, on average is higher in terms of capability than our average install base. That's actually really terrific news for us because a PC gamer who wants to enjoy games that are adapted from game consoles, which all of them are, now would have to upgrade their GPUs to enjoy at least a game console experience. And so I think that there's a \u2013 that bottom half of our install base has a real opportunity to enjoy at least the game console experience for just $150. I mean, you could \u2013 for a $150 graphics card, you could get an experience that is superior to a game console. I mean, that's quite an amazing value. And so that I think is also another reason to spur adoption.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. You may proceed with your question.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks, and congrats as well. Just a follow-up question on the virtual reality market and how you're looking at that. Can you talk a little bit about some of the PC requirements that are going to be necessary to use in a Facebook Oculus Rift headset when it comes out this quarter and the cost that's going to be needed for individual user? And kind of contrast that from the business model that Sony is employing, which is basically \u2013 based on my knowledge \u2013 a bundling strategy with their PlayStation 4, which wouldn't require an upgrade to the graphics card or buying a new desktop. Just wondering how you're thinking about those two different business models.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there are two different questions in there. One question is what is the minimum requirement for VR today. Using today's graphics card as an example, the GTX 970, which is the most popular graphics card in the world, is the min spec for the Oculus Rift. And the reason why, of course, is because Oculus and their PC focus wants to have the best possible experience for the early adopters of VR. And I think that's a really prudent strategy. You want to delight all of your early adopters with the best possible experience. But the way to think about it long term is that as the market continues to grow and more content comes and VR moves into the mainstream, there's no question in my mind that our $100 and $150 GeForce GTX cards will in the future be able to play VR just perfectly. And so \u2013 so this is not a question about the availability of technology or the cost of technology. As we know, technology continues to advance and whatever experience today will continue to get more affordable long term. Whatever the Sony PlayStation does, I think, is just fantastic either way. What we would like to do is get people excited about VR. And in the final analysis, there are TV gamers and then there are \u2013 there are console gamers and there are PC gamers. And there are different genres and there are different applications and different styles, and very largely different customers. And so I think we're just enthusiastic about VR, period. And over time, the technology will get more and more affordable.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Brian Alger with ROTH Capital Partners. You may proceed with your question.\nBrian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. I'll be very brief. The opportunity in automotive obviously continues to grow and your unveiling at CES was impressive by anyone's standards. However, there seems to be two approaches to the automotive market. As we move forward, there's obviously the closed system approach that Mobileye seems to be pursuing, and what appears to be more of an open architecture approach that you seem to have. Can you maybe describe how things shape up for you as you look out over the horizon with sensor fusion and the various OEMs and getting things right from a safety standards basis, et cetera? Do we need the control of a closed system or can we get it done with collaboration with others?\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I appreciate the question. It's really, really a good question. This is really a matter of philosophy. And philosophically, this is how we see the world. We believe that self-driving car is not a solved problem. And I say that as a statement of fact. I don't think anybody would dispute it. I also believe that self-driving cars is a field that's going to require the technological muscle of a very, very large industry and that no one company with a few hundred employees is going to solve it all by themselves. So the idea that a unsolved problem of such incredible, daunting levels that an entire computer industry is in the process of trying to solve could possibly be a closed system tied around a chip seems illogical to me. That's number one. Number two, I believe that long term, our car company \u2013 the soul of the car company is the driving experience of that car. The soul of the car company is the driving experience of the car. The soul of the company is the safety record of that car. The soul of the company is the functionality of that car. And in the future, the functionality, the safety, the driving experience of the car is going to be largely software defined. It's going to be artificial intelligence network defined. I just can't imagine great companies like BMW and Mercedes and Audi and all of the world, Toyota and the list goes on, and many great companies that are emerging into this marketplace, I just can't imagine that these companies would somehow outsource the soul of their car to a chip company. That's a second philosophical belief. And so what we've decided to do is to create an automotive autonomous car computing platform and all of the rich software that's necessary to enable this incredibly high-throughput computer to behave in a really energy-efficient way and cost-effective way, and to be able to apply our deep learning expertise so that these cars can benefit from artificial intelligence to solve these really complicated world problems. And that by partnering with every single car company in the world, that together we might be able to solve this incredibly daunting challenge and hopefully bring some society good. And so that's our approach is the open platform, and it starts really from a philosophical approach. Now, that philosophical approach results in a very substantial technological difference. Notice that our platform is completely programmable. We have rich tools. We know that developers all over the world can very easily buy themselves a GeForce TITAN and write CUDA applications and those CUDA applications will tomorrow run on a DRIVE PX just seamlessly. And so I think that's a really wonderful way for designers all over the world to be able to develop software which is really hard to do right now and then quickly deploy it into the card. And so our strategy is just very, very different and that's our approach. And my sense is that at the moment, it appears to be quite a good approach. Okay. I really appreciate that question.\nJen-Hsun Huang - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: NVIDIA is the world leader in visual and accelerated computing, which is helping to create exciting growth markets like VR, AI and self-driving cars, which will transform many industries and positively impact the future of society. Our strategy is to leverage one core investment into four growth markets; gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and auto, and it's delivering results and gaining momentum. Our goal is to balance investments to capture the enormous opportunity ahead while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance. I also want to remind everyone that our annual GPU Technology Conference will take place April 4 through 7 in San Jose. We'll be focusing on VR, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. We'll also be holding Analyst Day there and I look forward to seeing all of you. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. Third quarter revenue was a record $1.305 billion, up 7% from a year earlier, up 13% sequentially and substantially above our outlook of $1.18 billion. Growth was driven by record revenue for gaming, particularly for our GTX platform and automotive infotainment systems. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue was $1.11 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue was $129 million, down 23% from a year earlier. Our strategy remains focused on creating platforms for gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. Our progress is the result of product innovation, our strong position in growing markets, and disciplined execution. In Q3, our four market platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 71% a year earlier. First, let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue rose 44% year-on-year to $761 million. Growth is being fueled by a number of factors, among them, the significant increase in graphics production value, the rise of eSports, the anticipation of blockbuster games for the holiday season, and the emergence of new technologies like VR for richer, more immersive game play. Professional gaming competitions or eSports are well on their way to becoming a global entertainment category with an audience of 188 million viewers. There were 30 million viewers alone for last month's League of Legends World Championship. The launch of great gaming titles drives gaming platform sales. We are excited by the strong pipeline of AAA games ready for the holiday season, including Star Wars Battlefront, Call of Duty, Black Ops III, Rainbow Six and Fallout Four. Meanwhile, we are looking-forward to the launch of virtual reality, with the approaching availability of VR headsets from Oculus, HTC, and others, as well as new VR games such as EVE: Valkyrie. During the quarter we enabled a new category of high capable enthusiast class gaming notebooks with the launch of GTX 980. For the first time notebooks are able to deliver the same gaming experience as desktops and have the processing power to drive frame rates needed for VR. Our long-term bet on Android gaming is SHIELD. During the quarter, we extended the reach of SHIELD Android TV, the market's most advanced 4K smart TV console in two key European markets. We launched GeForce NOW which provides Netflix-like service for streaming games from the cloud to your SHIELD device. Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue increased 8% sequentially to $190 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year. At the SIGGRAPH Professional computer design conference, we introduced NVIDIA DesignWorks. This suite of algorithm libraries and tools enables developers to easily incorporate photo realistic visualization of product and building designs. And with DesignWorks VR, developers can easily provide the amazing experience for such areas as theme park design, product design, telepresence, and surgical training. In data center, inclusive of Tesla and GRID, revenue rose 13% sequentially to $82 million, reflecting demand in deep learning, high-performance computing, and graphic virtualization. Revenue declined 8% year-on-year due to the lumpiness from large deep learning projects. Most of the world's leading web services companies have adopted Tesla for deep learning to power next-generation services. In addition to using our GPUs for training servers on massive data set, companies like Baidu are using them for inference for such work as real-time voice recognition. In high-performance computing we increasingly find that GPUs are moving from the domain of researchers to commercial use, in such areas as weather forecasting and seismic processing. We continue to make progress as well with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications to employees on any device anywhere. At VMworld in San Francisco, we launched GRID 2.0, with twice the user density and application performance of its predecessor and support for both Linux and blade servers, a dozen fortune 100 companies are completing trials of GRID 2.0 and more than 125 OEM offered servers are qualified to run it. Also reflecting momentum for NVIDIA data center offerings Microsoft Azure announced that it is integrated NVIDIA GRID into its rapidly growing cloud service in response to customer demand for GPU acceleration in the Cloud. Finally, automotive revenue rose 51% year-on-year to a record $79 million. At last month's International Auto Show in Frankfurt, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, and Honda all showcased a range of production vehicles and concept cars with NVIDIA-powered digital cockpits, and our partner, Tesla Motors just introduced its falcon-winged Model X. Like the Model S, the Model X is equipped with both a multi-touch infotainment system and a digital instrument cluster powered by NVIDIA. Finally, we are continuing deeper collaborations with over 50 companies that are developing self-driving car technologies, using NVIDIA DRIVE PX. These include car manufacturers, Tier 1 OEMs, start-ups and research institutions. DRIVE PX is an advanced autonomous driving platform that fuses data from cameras, lidars, radar and ultrasonic sensors to determine the path forward using deep learning techniques. We look forward to sharing more details about this work at CES 2016. Our OEMs and IP business was $192 million, up 11% sequentially, driven by seasonal demand for notebooks. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin was 56.3%, non-GAAP gross margin was 56.5% in line with our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin increased from a year ago reflecting our strong gaming revenue. GAAP gross margin increased sequentially, as the previous quarter included a charge related to the NVIDIA SHIELD tablet recall. Non-GAAP gross margin was nearly flat sequentially. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $489 million, inclusive of $8 million of restructuring and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses including litigation charges were $430 million, slightly lower than our outlook. We continue to focus on operating efficiencies, and we manage investment growth while growing operating margins. GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, up 15% from $213 million a year earlier, reflecting strong revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $308 million, up 17% from $264 million a year earlier. GAAP net income was $246 million. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.44, including $0.01 of restructuring and other charges, as well as a benefit of $0.09 from a tax reserve relief. Non-GAAP net income was $255 million. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.46, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q3, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.73 billion. During the third quarter, we paid $53 million in cash dividends and we closed our accelerated repurchasing agreement with an additional 4.6 million shares returned. As a result, we have returned to shareholders an aggregate of $604 million fiscal year-to-date of our full year intent to return $800 million. As part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value, through capital return, we have announced an 18% increase to our quarterly cash dividend to $0.115 per share to be paid on December 14 to all shareholders of record on November 20. In addition, we are pleased to announce our intention in fiscal 2017 to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and eSports, VR, and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU accelerated data centers are expanding in both high performance computing and cloud, driven by the acceptance of deep learning techniques. And the transition to autonomous driving is well underway. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be $1.3 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.7% and 57%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $503 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. For fiscal 2016, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses excluding litigation costs to be approximately flat with fiscal 2015. Litigation costs are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook excludes restructuring charges which are expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million as we finalize the wind down of the Icera operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Further, financial details including the CFO commentary and revenue by market platforms are available on our IR website. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for the first question which comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for the question, and congratulations on the great results. For my first question, the last two quarters you have substantially exceeded your original outlook and PC gaming has been an important part of that. And I'm wondering these trends that you're seeing or the upside surprise that you have seen in both these quarters, has that come more from units, has that come more from better mix or ASPs or share gains? And more importantly, how sustainable is this kind of upside trajectory?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Vivek, first of all, thanks. Well, I think that we've been consistent that our PC gaming business is driven by several factors. The first factor is the great AAA titles that are coming out with ever increasingly graphics production value. The second is just the number of eSports players that are growing around the world. And it's a very social phenomenon. The more of your friends are joining eSports, the more you have to join eSports, so that you can hang out with your friends. The third is the developing countries. One of the things about PC gaming and overall gaming is that you really need to have broadband access anymore so that you can download these amazing games. And so, as broadband adoption continues to grow in the developing countries, the PC is really the best way to get into gaming. It's a platform that you need for your daily lives anyways, and surely most young people need it for school. And so that's been helpful. All of those factors have increased both the units as well as the ASPs that we're enjoying. If you look at the size of the overall market, I think it's probably fair to say that we're not fully penetrated. And our expectation is that as we look into next year, all of the great games that are coming out, whether it's Call of Duty that's coming out, or Star Wars that's coming out, or Assassin's Creed or Tomb Raider, surely everybody's quite excited about VR coming out in the beginning of next year. So I think there are several growth drivers that are still quite powerful and our expectation is that this is going to be a large market going forward.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks, Jen-Hsun. And for my follow-up question, not to quibble, but when I look at your Q4 guidance, it's strong, better than expectations, but it implies flattish trends in what is usually a seasonally stronger quarter. If you could just give us some color on what segments directionally do you think would be up or down versus Q3? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the guidance that we provide is the guidance that we think is best and balanced. And we'll see how the quarter plays out. But the growth drivers in our business overall, gaming is a growth driver, and we just mentioned some of the dynamics that are underlying it. Data centers is a growth driver for us and I'm sure we'll be talking more about that during the conference call. And then third, the automotive business is a growth driver for us. And so we have several growth drivers, but at this point, our guidance is the best we have to offer.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on virtual reality as a driver. It seems that you have fairly low expectations for 2016. When you see the Oculus VR demos, I really leave with the sense that they could transform business processes for many different industries and it seems like a lot of potential. So I'm just trying to reconcile that kind of reaction that I've noticed versus your it seems like lower key expectations for virtual reality as a driver. So if you could help reconcile that, that'd be great.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, Mark, we are over the top excited about virtual reality. There's nobody at NVIDIA who is low key about it. There's no question that when you enjoy the Oculus headset with GeForce GTX 980 or GeForce GTX Titan the experience is unbelievable. And recently we even produced a whole family of notebooks that are able to enjoy VR directly from the notebook. And so we're super excited about VR. The sense of presence that you have in enjoying VR headsets whether it's from Oculus or Valve's Vive, it's really fantastic. We also see that the application of VR is quite sweeping. Of course, we're quite enthusiastic about games and the games that we've seen are really amazing. But it's used for industrial design, architectural design, it's used for, whether it's medical imaging, even scientific computing. We're seeing entertainment, large-scale entertainment, large format entertainment. And so we're seeing all kinds of applications from places all over the world. We're tracking over 250 companies now that are working with us on VR and it ranges everywhere from video games to entertainment, to professional graphics, as I've mentioned. Our approach is to provide a platform by which the entire VR industry can be built upon and so we call it our DesignWorks VR for our enterprise products, our professional products, and GameWorks VR for our consumer products. And by connecting to our APIs and connecting to our SDK, the performance and the experience is just phenomenal. Now, maybe your question is much more related to financial. And I guess our approach there is to be enthusiastic about the work that we are doing, to support the entire industry as it moves into VR. We are engaged deeply with the industry in doing so. I think that we built the premier platform for VR for both PC gaming as well as professional graphics. As far as financial is concerned, realize that the shipment hasn't really started yet and I think it's prudent to wait and see. But my expectation long-term is that VR is going to be a very powerful growth driver for us. That is almost undeniable at this point based on everything that we've seen and all the effort that's going into it.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. Thank you for that. Follow-up question, if I may. On the gaming software, the PC gaming software, there's a strong product cycle you've mentioned a number of times. Is there a risk that this is partially helping to drive gaming GPU sales now and then there's some kind of a let-up later on in, say, two or three quarters from now? How should we think about that? Is there a correlation between gaming software launches and lumpy shipments of gaming GPUs? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I guess in the end, it's hard to predict. There's only a few things that we do know. The first principles of what we know are that the gaming market overall is growing. The number of eSports players is continuing to grow. The number of countries, developing countries, that are now able to bring more people into gaming is growing as they continue to adopt broadband. The production value of the video games are just amazing. Boy, if you just look at Star Wars and Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty and Tomb Raider, I mean, they're almost cinematic. And so our expectation is that these factors combined is going to continue to drive the gaming market forward. And so we'll see from quarter-to-quarter how they do, but at the moment everywhere in the world, we're just seeing gaming to be quite vibrant.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Mark.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, Jen-Hsun, if I could on the automotive market. First of all, at your last Analyst Day you guys mentioned an aggregate backlog number for an estimate on the rough value of the design wins over a number of years looking out. I was wondering if you could potentially provide us an update on how that number changed over the last several quarters. And related to that, given the nice pipeline that you guys have building up, can you talk about what sense of urgency your customers are telling you guys in terms of how quickly they need to get Tegra into some of these systems, whether it's infotainment or ADAS-type products and what that translates to in terms of the revenues coming on for Tegra?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Stephen. First of all, our automotive business is growing quite robustly and year-over-year it's grown over 50%. And our expectation is that it's going to continue to grow through next year and a couple years of after that. Meanwhile, there are two very important dynamics that are happening in the car industry that is very favorable for us. One dynamic has to do with the central car computer. It is very clear now that your future car will be software-defined. That there will likely be multiple operating systems. These operating systems will control graphics-rich experiences, that this centralized computer will be built like a data center so that it can be secure, it can be robust, it can be mission-critical. And software is going to play just a huge role in it. And so when the car becomes more and more computerized, more than just digital, more than just electronic, but it's computerized and that it's software-rich, it plays into our hands, because we're such a great software company. We know system software incredibly well and software capability is one of our major differentiating advantages. It's one of the reasons why we're able to do what we do. The second dynamic is that whereas the first generation of driver assistance was made possible with radars and the second generation included cameras. The first generation of autonomous driving is about to come. Autonomous driving hasn't really made its way into the market yet. And we're seeing the early versions of that, but architectures that enable fully autonomous driving is yet to come. And this is an area where we really have a great deal of capability. It's going to require sensor fusion, it's going to require an enormous amount of software, it's going to require artificial intelligence and it's going to require the ability to support an open computing platform that NVIDIA is built upon. If you look at our accelerated computing platform, it's programmed by so many people in the world and this is a real advantage because car companies need the ability to develop their own artificial intelligence network so that they can ultimately own their driving experience. And so this is something that I think the new era of autonomous cars and autonomous vehicles is a great opportunity for us. So those two dynamics are going to be fundamental to the future growth of our automotive business.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for that color, Jen-Hsun. And as my follow-up question, I was wondering if you could help parse out some of the drivers within the Tesla and GRID product families. Just between high-performance computing, cloud data center, and traditional corporate enterprise-type customers that are currently buying your Tesla and GRID products. Can you talk about the near medium term demand trends across the different verticals? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I appreciate that question. PC gaming, of course, is a powerful growth driver for us. Our automotive business is a growth driver for us. And I fully expect our data center business to be a growth driver for us. We've simplified our data center strategy over the course of last several quarters. Whereas we used to have multiple data center strategies, we now have basically one data center platform with multiple applications that drive it on top. The data center platform \u2013 accelerated data center platform is called Tesla. On top of it, we have multiple software stacks. The first software stack that we created was for high-performance computing for scientists to be able to do things like weather simulations and molecular dynamic simulations, and quantum chemistry simulations, to material simulations. And so, HPC, high-performance computing was our first stack. We also talked about GRID. GRID is our enterprise virtualization stack. We have GeForce NOW, which is our cloud gaming stack. And one of the things that's super important in the future is the work that we're going to do in hyperscale data centers that allowed cloud data centers to do their work around artificial intelligence and to take the pressure off of the enormous amount of new traffic that is swamping and flooding data centers from users generating their own video. Basically everybody's going to become a broadcaster. And there are PC gamers that are already broadcasting on a daily basis, and Twitch is the name by which we all know it by. But you're going to see YouTube Live. YouTube Live is doing incredibly well. And then, you're going to see applications like Meerkat and Periscope and there are more coming that basically lets almost everybody become a broadcaster. You're going to have billions of people broadcasting to billions of other people. And all of those videos today needs to be somehow processed. And our GPUs are really fantastic at that. And so, we have multiple applications, if you will, that sit on top of our data center platform. Now, the dynamics that I've mentioned some, one, one of the most important dynamics around data centers is Moore's Law needs a boost. We know now that Moore's Law is under some amount of pressure and it's not growing as fast as the industry needs it to. So Moore's Law needs a boost and that's really what Tesla is about. Tesla is an accelerated computing platform that boosts the microprocessor. So that's one dynamic. The second dynamic is what I mentioned, the global race to AI. The global race to AI, there's not one data center on the planet. There's not one cloud service on the planet. Frankly, there's not one application company on the planet that we know of, that's not trying to figure out how AI can completely revolutionize the applications that they provide. And then, of course, accelerating the cloud and making it possible for cloud to offer smart services and graphics-rich services, like the announcement that we recently did with Microsoft Azure. Azure now provides the NVIDIA GRID to power graphics accelerated applications as a service and we're super excited about that. So those dynamics are happening all in real-time and it's contributed to our sequential growth of 13%.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Jen-Hsun and congrats on the strong results.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Stephen.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Congrats, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us a quick rundown on the competitive dynamic in the data center, particularly with GRID, if there is any kind of competition and the reason I bring it up is that the Intel Altera combo perhaps is a way to kind of fight what you guys are doing there? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Hans, first of all, thank you. Well, I think it's very clear at this point that boosting Moore's Law is an essential path forward that relying on CPUs alone for the entire workload of a data center is unrealistic and frankly unnecessary. There are no supercomputing centers that I know of that are not considering accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because just relying on traditional methods, unfortunately doesn't allow you to scale your data center in an efficient way anymore. There are no hyperscale data centers that I know of that aren't somehow overwhelmed and flooded by the user generated video content or the need to move to machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide smarter services. And so, these dynamics are putting a lot of pressure on data centers and it's one of the reasons why there's so much talk about new approaches for improving the throughput of these data centers, whether it's supercomputing data centers or hyperscale data centers across the board. And I think that's an enormous opportunity for us. This is an area that we have invested almost 10 years in. And as you know, I have been talking about accelerated data centers now for, well, 10 years. And this is an area that we are seeing a lot of momentum and as other people pursue other ideas, I think it's just an acknowledgment that this is really a good path forward. I think that in your question, you also specifically asked about FPGAs. FPGAs, we use FPGAs at NVIDIA. And we use FPGAs to do simulations and emulations of our products. FPGAs have been around a long time and they are perfect for certain applications. The challenge for \u2013 I guess the tradeoff is an FPGA is like it's designed. It's designed and configured on an array of transistors and gates, whereas a GPU is a full custom processor that is designed completely by hand. Whereas one FPGA is designed probably by a handful of engineers, a GPU is designed by thousands of engineers. And a GPU performing a task could be 100 times the frequency, 100 times the performance of that of a FPGA. It stands to reason that it's a result of handcraftsmanship and a processor that's designed to go very fast. And FPGA, however, can do specific tasks quite well. If you only want to do one or two things, you can surely limit the functionality and make an FPGA quite efficient. However, our perspective is that a data center doesn't do one or two things. A data center runs thousands of applications. A data center has video, has imaging. It has voice. It does machine learning. The algorithms are changing every day. Today, the algorithms are convolution neural nets, tomorrow, it has memory, and after that, it's recursive. And so the type of neural nets just keep growing and the algorithms just keep on moving forward. And so, our belief is that the vast array of applications and the evolution of the algorithms really makes a processor much much easier to adopt and much faster to increase the overall throughput of your data center. And so, we will see how it plays out, but at the moment, we are enjoying a lot of enthusiasm around accelerated computing.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the run down.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Hans.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering on GeForce NOW, how is that revenue going to be recorded as you start getting subscribers and is that going to go under GRID or is that going to go under SHIELD, and can you talk a little bit more about what gross margins are expected for that?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's not very much right now, so it's not much to talk about. But I think that the way to think about it is this, SHIELD and GeForce NOW is our long-term bet on the future of gaming. When we look out in the future, I think there are two dynamics that I think are unquestionable. One dynamic is that Android is going to become more important in an operating system. Don't forget gaming is about computer gaming. Gaming is made possible because it's built on top of a computer architecture and Android is the most popular operating system in the world. And so, it's undeniable that it will become a major force in gaming some day and SHIELD is our bet in that. The second is that Cloud services application as a service and therefore video games as an application, as a service will eventually come. It took many years for Netflix to eventually become mainstream and my expectation is that it will take several years for GeForce NOW to become a popular all over the world. And so, those two dynamics, I think are largely unquestionable. The question is not so much if, the question is simply when. And then, maybe the next question is who? Who is best equipped to be able to bring this future into the world and we feel that as the world leader in visual computing and as one of the major platform leaders in video games today, that this is an area that we can really make a great contribution. It's a modest investment for us and we are thoughtful about the level that we invest to make sure that it times with long-term the opportunity. Okay? But if we were to recognize the revenues just to put it back into the original question, if we were to recognize the revenues, it would go into gaming.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great, and maybe if I could ask one other question about the split in the PC gaming business between notebook and I've seen a lot of reviews of the new gaming notebooks, it seems all top 10 are based on GeForce and between notebooks and your cards, what's the revenue split now?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the revenue split is largely still PC desktops. I appreciate you bringing up the notebook work that we did. Maxwell, the GPU architecture that we created and the craftsmanship of the GPUs we made are so incredible that it's finally possible for a notebook to be able to deliver the same level of performance as a desktop and our timing was timed so that people who want to enjoy VR with a notebook can finally do it. And so the latest generation of notebooks with GTX 980 are just amazing. I mean, they are so many times more powerful than a game console. It fits in a space smaller than a game console and it can drive VR. Everything you want to do, every game you want to play is possible on that thin laptop. And so the enthusiasm behind our launch with GTX 980 has been really, really fantastic. I appreciate you recognizing it.\nKevin Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, congratulations.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One is back on the professional side, Jen-Hsun. If I look at Quadro and Tesla, what reverses the year-over-year decline that we have seen the last couple of quarters? As it relates to Tesla, is it just a matter of timing of when the HPC systems get launched? And the second follow-up was for Euclid on the IP side and expenses for IP. What is the -- it's not debatable that you guys have a very unique IP portfolio, but I'm wondering given the initial reversal you had on the lawsuit against Qualcomm and Samsung, why should the expenses be continuing to be higher on that front? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Thanks for the questions, Ambrish. Let me take it in reverse order. So first on IP. It's not over. The administrative law judge has opined that of the three patents that he had to rule on, that two were not infringed and one was infringed, but he opined invalid. Of course, we disagree with that, and we have submitted our rebuttal. And now all of that has to go to the commission, which is ultimately where the ruling happens. The next phase is for the commission to decide whether they want to review, and we hope they do and it's not uncommon that they do. And then in February timeframe, the commission would determine their judgment, and it is not uncommon at all to have the commission disagree with the administrative law judge. And so I think it's far from over and, therefore, I guess, it's not over. But I think that the higher level point is this. The higher level point is that our IP is very important to us. That invention as the world leader in our field is fundamental and core to our future. We have to invent the future. We are the world leader, after all. And from time to time, we may decide that as a one-off and strategically decide that we would defend our IP. And this is what we have done in this case. But it's not our business model. We don't litigate for our business model. We don't depend on licensing for our business model. And I hope that all of you on the call today don't invest in our company as a result of IP royalties. What I hope that you see is that we are quite a unique company, and we are a world leader in the space that we endeavor, that visual computing is more important than ever and applies to more industries than ever. And that our business model is really about selling products into vertical markets that are really exciting and quite vibrant and growing. And so I hope that you decide to invest on the basis of the products, the business model, and our special position in the marketplace. On the two questions related to Tesla and Quadro, as you know, Quadro is about design and it's about workstations, it's about manufacturing, it's about things that people make. And we are a very, very, very significant leader in this market. We make a great deal of contributions to this market, but it's also a mature market. And so the way that \u2013 our strategy for growing Quadro is very, very simple. We have to reinvent it, and we have to reinvent it by bringing new capabilities to it, and we have two that we're quite excited about. One is a new technology called Iray, and Iray is a brand new way of generating images that is photorealistic and physically accurate. It's almost like inventing the font of desktop publishing. What you see is what you will get. And it's just really quite amazing. And so I think Iray is going to rejuvenate the way that people do computer graphics and I hope that it will increase the size of the market, make it easier for people to design products and it will increase our ASPs quite significantly. Number two, VR. We have already mentioned before that from design to architectural design to medical imaging to scientific computing to large-scale entertainment, we're seeing that VR is going to be very important. So those two we hope will drive the future growth of Quadro and get it back on a growth track. As for Tesla, we grew 13% quarter-over-quarter. We declined year-over-year. Frankly, it didn't meet my expectation either. However, the fundamental dynamics, the reasons don't really matter here or there, but the fundamental dynamics are incredibly sound. And the groundswell around the fundamental dynamics is unquestionable. Moore's Law needs a boost. AI, every company on the planet is racing towards the future of AI and cloud computing needs to be accelerated with graphics as Microsoft Azure has demonstrated. And so my expectation is that we'll grow sequentially again and that the fundamental dynamics around Tesla is just really, really positive.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for all the details, Jen-Hsun. Good luck.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Ambrish.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag. Please go ahead.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On virtual reality, so the recommended specs from Oculus are something like a GTX 970, but I think a lot of third parties and I think even you guys have mentioned that it actually requires much more in order to get a pretty reasonable experience. So can you help us understand what we should be expecting in terms of the average set-up for what's called an early adopter of Oculus? Should we expect two GTX 970s, should we expect a GTX 980, a Titan? Anything would be helpful there. And then also if you could walk us through the economic fall through for NVIDIA in terms of what kind of revenues you would expect to see or ASPs NVIDIA would recognize for, let's say, a $300 card and what kind of gross profit dollar fall through we could see from that as well? Thanks a lot.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, appreciate that. So I would say that the GTX 970 is the minimum requirement. It is the minimum requirement. And I think Oculus has done a good job setting the minimum requirement. And I think the minimum requirement simply means that anything below it is not going to be a great experience. We're seeing more and more content coming and usually the content gets richer. Content doesn't usually move backwards. And so the production value is going to continue to grow. If you buy into a GTX 970, it will give you a limited amount of growth over time, but if you buy into a GTX 980 or GTX Titan, you just have a lot more opportunities to continue to enjoy that platform for a longer period of time as content gets richer. And so in terms of the economics, our gross margins are higher on GTX 970 and above, it's higher than our corporate average. And so we appreciate the adoption and the growth in that segment of the marketplace. But ultimately our focus is to help enable the entire ecosystem of hundreds of companies who are working on VR to be able to deliver this experience to the marketplace that fulfills the promise of VR. We're just intensely concerned that if we don't do a great job that we ruin a great thing. This is really, really a great thing. And the folks at Oculus and the folks at Valve, the folks at HTC, ourselves and the 230 companies that are out there working on VR, we all want to deliver just a fantastic experience. And that's our focus at the moment. And our recommendation, if anybody were to walk up to me and ask me for a recommendation, I would tell them that a GTX 980 Ti would be the baseline and, in my own case, I'll probably have a pair of Titans, which, who doesn't need a pair of Titans?\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Well, that would be really nice for all of us. So then on that same theme, if I think about the competitive dynamics into next year, so you I think pretty obviously have taken a significant leadership advantage, especially at that enthusiast portion versus AMD. As we go into VR, when you talk to the game developer community, what kinds of things are you doing in order to maintain that advantage? And what kinds of things could we see in Pascal that could actually allow you to extend that advantage?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, we respect our competitors. We take our competition seriously. You know that as a company we compete pretty intensely. And this is a company that has seen a lot of competition over the years and so we take competition seriously, we respect the capabilities of our competition. However, I think it's also very, very clear that our business and our business model and our strategy is completely different than AMD and the PC graphics chip company we used to be a long time ago. And our company is just on a different trajectory. Our approach to building products is different. Our approach at go-to-market is different. Our approach in engaging the ecosystem is different. I can't imagine a more different company to tell you the truth. And so as much as we are always alert and paranoid about \u2013 and we don't take our position for granted and we are thoughtful about competition, we have our own work to do and we have our own platform to do and we have our own ecosystem to go and care for and nurture and push forward. And so I think that I appreciate the question, but I can't imagine a more different company, to tell you the truth.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.: Thank you. Congrats on the solid quarter. This is Jee for Ross Seymore. Just going back to the guidance, given that there's a slate of AAA-rated games coming out this quarter, I guess what's the reason behind the conservatism behind the expectations for gaming, or is that growth expected to be offset by other segments?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, our guidance is the best guidance we think we should provide at this moment and we'll see how the market plays out. We're not in control of the market, as you know. But I think at the foundational level, we have multiple growth drivers. And some of them on some day exceeds our expectations and some of them don't exceed our expectation. But that's one of the benefits of our business model today. That's one of the benefits of our strategy today. We have multiple growth drivers in the company. PC gaming is a growth driver. Artificial intelligence is a growth driver. VR is a growth driver. Autonomous cars is a growth driver. And I really don't know of that many companies in the world that is working on these important dynamics in the industry that's going to shape the future of computing all together. So we have multiple growth drivers in our company. And I believe that those drivers are fundamentally sound and powerful. However, we'll see how they turn out at the end of the quarter and I remain optimistic. And so we're enthusiastic about the guidance we provided and are optimistic that we'll do a good job on it. And then we'll just have to see how it turns out.\nJee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.: Thank you. And for my follow-up. It looks like some of the revenue segmentations for the end markets was changed a little bit this quarter with the new classification of Quadro and data center or pro-visualization and data center versus enterprise and HPC cloud. What was behind the change? And is it related to the unifying of the data center strategy?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's right. That's exactly right. The reason we decided to classify it a little differently is because I changed the architecture of it. We used to have several different product lines and each one of the product lines were planned differently and they were specified differently and so on and so forth. We've decided to unify all of our data center product lines and abstracted out the software from it. And so from this one unified platform, Tesla, Tesla is our accelerated computing platform. And on top of it are software stacks that allows us to solve a problem for a particular marketplace. So, for example, we have our entire software stack for HPC. We have a rich software stack for enterprise virtualization, we call Grid. We have a software stack that is incredible for providing cloud gaming around the world, that's called GeForce NOW and then we are going to have a software stack for hyperscale. And so each one of these software stacks are built on top of one common architecture, one common platform called Tesla Accelerated Computing. And so as a result, we decided to unify all of that and report it simply as data centers. And, quite frankly, I think it will just be easier to understand.\nJee-Hoon Park - Deutsche Securities Korea Co.: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you for taking my question. And solid job on the quarterly execution. On the strong growth in the gaming segment; blockbuster games, eSports, big drivers, but there appears to be another potential driver and that is the shift from console to PC gaming here in the U.S. I think Jen-Hsun, you've always characterized the U.S. as a console-centric market, but this seems to be changing pretty rapidly with high schoolers and some of the older demographics here in the U.S. I don't know what the stats are, but thus far I think it's been a pretty big untapped market. So how much of this penetration is contributing to the growth in your gaming business?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, Harlan, first of all, thank you. I think that there is no question that the U.S. \u2013 even the U.S. is seeing growth in PC gaming and the fundamental reason is really quite singular, eSports. eSports is it may be the new social platform. It is the new digital playground. You go hang out with your friends. It's the new virtual arcade. This is how you hang out with your friends. Not only do you play \u2013 if you're not playing, you are watching, but at all times you are talking to your friends. This is how you hang out. And so this is a big deal. This isn't something you can do easily on mobile. This isn't something you can do easily on TV. This particular platform really benefits from having a PC. And so eSports is probably, if I had to tag it on one thing, eSports would probably be it. The growth of eSports, as you know, not only is the gamers enjoying eSports and growing faster than anybody would have expected, and I think the reason for that is because it's a social platform, and therefore, it grows not linearly but arguably exponentially. And in the case of eSports, there's also viewerships, and now all kinds of businesses are cropping up to help people enjoy watching eSports and sharing the moment with other people. So I think this is real. And it's quite exciting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And congratulations, again. In terms of the buyback for next year, can you talk about your domestic cash position and would you need to do anything synthetic to achieve that buyback?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, thanks, Joe, for the question. We have an outlook for our capital return program next year to return $1 billion as well as the increase in the dividend that will be in effect there. We continue to look at our overall total cash balance and also our U.S. cash balance. We still receive cash flow from both the combination of our international operations and our U.S. operations, which will take us through the good part of fiscal year 2017 in probably the whole amount. But if some need comes, we have several options for us to think about how we would fund that and we'll look at that at that time, if necessary.\nJoe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then I was under the impression from our conversations during the quarter that there was a 14-week quarter in January. Is that the case? And if so, does that have any impact on the financials?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. This fiscal year, we do have an extra week in this fiscal year. So we have incorporated our best estimates at this time for the fourth quarter incorporating that extra week.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: A powerful quarter, congratulations, everyone. Jen-Hsun, I know you touched upon the challenges in the data center for Moore's Law and that driving opportunity for you. But what are your own big picture thoughts on the implications of Moore's Law for your core GPU business? And then associated with that, if I think about the increasing challenges of Moore's Law as well as the power of some of the big OEMs, and it can be either on the hardware, or on the cloud side, and many of them are both, how does that not mean you need to have some sort of licensing business or strategic partnership business in order to move your technology forward? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Alex, first of all, thanks for the question. Well, semiconductors and chips is really important to us. And on balance, it's a lot easier if the world will just get better without anybody having to work for it, i.e., Moore's Law. And so if every year transistors just got faster and they got morbid and they got cheaper and so on and so forth, all at the same time, it surely would make for a easier ride. However, accelerated computing is a very different beast. The way that accelerated computing works and some people have characterized NVIDIA's growth and performance to Moore's Law squared and I don't think it's much far off from that actually. And the reason for that has to do with the fact that we change our -- we can innovate change, improve our GPU underneath, the software stack on top, the algorithms that we innovate on top of that, and then also targeting specific applications. One of the things that most people don't realize is that we are not a general purpose processor. We only target a few specific applications. And the specific applications as you know that we focus on is visual computing and this particular field has become quite large. And because of the work that we have done, whether it's visual computing, images, video, and very parallel applications, which artificial intelligence falls into, these applications are just right down the strike zone and right in the bull's-eye of accelerated computing. They just have \u2013 maybe it happened by serendipity, but we hope that we have a large part to do with it that the accelerator that we created made it possible for these applications to move forward. And as a result, moved forward more quickly and became large markets. And so, I would say that the answer to your question is that we don't just do chips and the value proposition of our platform is really about chips, about software, about algorithms and applications that we select. And that combination is really, really powerful. Now your second question has to do with IP licensing. I would say that five years ago as a technology component company, a PC graphics chip company, where our path to market is only through OEMs, our path to market is only through OEMs that our industry, where our products are industry standard with, i.e., Wintel or PC, or so on and so forth. That's no longer true. We now have four vertical markets by which we engage to market ourselves that we can go directly to the market, we can innovate openly and we have specialized platforms whereby we can innovate without dependency on somebody else. And so whether it's accelerated data centers, which has a specialized platform, gaming, where we go to market ourselves and we have a specialized platform there, these markets are really, really large. And so, the reinvention of our company put us in very large markets that are growing quite robustly. And so I think our primary focus today is through product sales. And so, we changed our business model that way, if you will, instead of remaining a components company and moving, if you will, backwards into licensing. We decided to move forward into the market vertically and creating specialized platforms.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi Jen-Hsun, one question on the gaming notebooks. You indicated that now you have the same desktop graphics and notebooks. And my question to that is with the VR coming in and notebooks, graphics getting more powerful, do you see that it could shift from desktops to notebook, your product mix, and if so do you think that that mix is less favorable or similarly favorable to you versus desktop graphics?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I guess I would say, I don't care. I would say that I don't care and the reason for that is these desktop -- these notebook GPUs are really high end. And they are all GeForce platforms to us. They all go to the same gamers and so I think the most important thing is that we would like the games to have higher graphics production value, the AAA games. I would like eSports to continue to grow. I would like developing countries to have broadband. And I would like VR to be incredible. And so I would say that those are really the drivers for our business, and however a gamer would like to enjoy GeForce, we would love to welcome him.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yes. Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you had mentioned I think earlier in the call in response to a question that obviously you guys are not fully penetrated in gaming with the eSports phenomenon and more broadband coming to emerging markets. Maybe you could help us understand and break down the growth between unit growth or overall installed base growth versus upgrade sales from the current install base? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is the segment, the growth between that and what's the upgrade cycle you see when someone say they bought a high-end GPU from you a year ago, what's the upgrade cycle in links and what are the real drivers to that upgrade cycle to someone that is already engaged with you and in your install base? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. So, of course, one of the most important drivers is the combination \u2013 it's the combination of really, really high production value games and our install base, because our install base are already gamers, our installed base are already GeForce customers and when new games come out, new amazing games come out, the install base wants to upgrade their GPUs to support it. And so if you look at our install base and just take a look at our, if you will, first base -- the mainstream GTX, let's pick the GTX 950. GTX 950 class install base represents probably less than a quarter of our install base. Another way of thinking about it is that three quarters of our install base really needs to get upgraded so that they can enjoy today's exciting AAA titles. And so, the install base alone is a really exciting opportunity for our growth and that's only possible because of the amazing AAA titles. It's the Star Wars of the world, the Call of Duty's of the world, the Assassin's Creed and the Batman's that really causes our install base, inspires our install base to upgrade to new GPUs. And so that alone has really great growth opportunity. Not to mention the other factors that you started with which was eSports and developing countries having broadband and then, of course, what we hoped to be a big driver in the coming year with VR. And so the install base I think is a big growth driver for us. Okay?\nOperator: Please note that at this time we are taking one question at a time. The next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah, thank you, and congratulations on good results. And a lot of this has been talked about before, but just wanted to get a sense of kind of the normalized revenue growth rate, at least as much as you can discuss with some of the headwinds that you experienced this year, potentially abating next year, mainly the PC OEM business, it might not decline this fast or at the same rate as it did this year. So I was wondering if you could maybe discuss little bit about the more of a normalized growth rate. It seems like this year you are going to end up about 5% growth rate given the fact that PCs have fallen pretty significantly. So any color there would be helpful?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I appreciate it. I think, first of all, the recognition that our PC OEM or our OEM business has largely, the decline has abated. We obviously still work on OEM projects and we're selective about the OEM projects. We're thoughtful about the projects we work on. And we care very much about working with our strategic partners. For example, some of the really amazing projects that have been announced recently, the Microsoft Surface Book. I mean, holy cow! What a great laptop. Mine should be arriving any day now. And so, I'm super excited about that. I thought Panos and the guys over at Microsoft just did a killer job on that laptop. And it was incredibly challenging, and we love to work and we love building groundbreaking work. And in the other project, over at Google, with Google Pixel C, I thought it was amazing. I mean, it's just a fantastic laptop. And it's based on our latest generation Tegra. Hiroshi and the team did a great job building it, and what a fantastic new tablet model. And so, we're going to continue to work on these type of OEM projects. And so we have exciting ones that we're in the process of working on. And so, my expectation is that the PC OEM business and the Tegra OEM business is going to be here. But it's just not a huge focus of ours \u2013 focus is not the right word, it's not where we expect our growth drivers to come from. Our major growth drivers are the four that we've talked about several times during the call. In terms of growth rate, I think it's going to take potentially a couple years for us to have some kind a feeling for growth rate. Let me tell you why. In no time in the history of our company did we have a brand new business model, first of all. We have a brand new business model. This new business model leverages one architecture, but instead of going towards just serving OEMs, we largely engage the vertical markets ourselves. It's a platform strategy, it's an ecosystem strategy. We engage the markets directly ourselves. So this new business model transition and the approach to this market is really working and accelerating. Now, because we're engaging the markets directly and we're looking at some very large markets, the autonomous driving market is going to be a large market. The accelerated data center market, it's going to be a large market. AI is going to be large, VR is going to be large. PC gaming is going to be large. And so we're now engaging large markets and we have multiple growth drivers. And so I think that the TAM for the company is larger than any time that we've ever enjoyed. And so that's kind of the second thing. We have multiple growth drivers and they have large TAMs. And then finally, gosh, we're just doing really exciting and important work that will shape the future of computing. I don't know any time in the history of our company that we're working on things like AI and VR and self-driving cars and cloud computing all at the same time. And so all of that leveraging one fundamental architecture, which gave us the ability to simultaneously engage these vertical markets with a very powerful singular investment behind it. And so I think our business model is very different. The vertical markets we engage are very different and I hope that, as a result, our growth will continue to surprise.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you very much. In your gaming GPUs, do you have any estimate of what market share you currently control and how that's been changing over the last few quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, David, thanks for the question. We don't really control anything. Our products are purchased by our gamers freely and so it's not really a matter of control. And I mean that in a way that, look, we've got to earn the love and loyalty of our customers every single day. And whereas we used to be a PC OEM company, an OEM company where that responsibility lies on our OEMs, today that responsibility really lies with us and we take it really, really seriously. We have 70 million gamers that are connected with us. I hope that we add value to them on a continuous basis and that we earn their trust and their loyalty over time. The beauty of this model, of course, it's much, much harder. It requires much, much greater understanding of the software stack. The way that you digitally connect and engage your community has to be very different than before. Obviously the PC OEM model is simple. The selling motion is simple. The marketing motion is simple. Everything we do today, the selling motion is much more complicated and the marketing motion is much more complicated. But the end result is that the promise that we made to them, whether it's Quadro's ability to help you realize your imagination, to GeForce that helps you enjoy your game to the fullest, these promises we have the ability to deliver on a day-to-day basis. And so over time I believe it allows us to create much deeper connections with our customers, which in business talk is stickiness, but we don't think of it that way. We think of it as earning the loyalty and the trust and hopefully the passion of our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nIan L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Yes, thanks. A question for Colette here. Lots of interesting opportunities and investments here. Could you update us in terms of where we are in terms of identifying and implementing the operating synergies? I think at the Analyst Day you talked about some software synergies unifying the silicon architecture. Thanks.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think our focus over this last several years has really been focusing around one single unified architecture and investment. That's really helped us to make the appropriate investments that we need in these four different markets that we're going after, but allowing us also to really focus on a single architecture that allows the efficiencies that we're seeing in our operating expenses. That is still going to be our focus as we move into the current quarter Q4 and as we move forward into fiscal year 2017, as our financial performance is very important to us and improving that financial performance in the short term. So thanks for the recognition of noting our work on our investment portfolio and ensuring that our investments are right-sized for our top line.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Roland with FBR & Company. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys. Let me echo my congrats on a really strong quarter here. So the current leader in ADAS, autonomous driving I guess is where they are going with this, they're running their platform off of what's essentially like a $5 microcontroller and they really talk down the importance of hardware. So, Jen-Hsun, maybe if I could get your idea on what you think this hardware platform \u2013 I know the importance of software, but what this hardware platform might look like for these future generations that you're talking about.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Chris, I appreciate that. If we can get a $5 microcontroller to drive and it's just a matter of software and driving is like one of the most complicated things we do, I think humans could be replaced in just about everything we do with a $3 microcontroller. And so it seems unlikely. I agree that smart microcontrollers could be used to enhance smart cameras to do computer vision and I think that for ADAS it is really, really good, just to be serious here. I think that smart cameras, whether it's from Tier 1s or from companies in Japan various companies around the world, the ADAS driver \u2013 better cruise control to automatic braking to lane keeping, those things are all important things and it improves our driver experience. But autonomous driving is just a whole different thing. Autonomous driving nobody's figured out. And obviously, there are several companies that we know who have real cars on the market who are doing autonomous driving and there's no pretense. Nobody is saying that all it takes is a $5 microcontroller to make that happen. It takes a lot of computing to make that possible. And so our strategy is not driver assistance. I mean, I've been consistent about that. I appreciate all of the people's work that are enhancing driver assistance, whether it's radar or ultrasonics or cameras to move driver assistance forward. Our strategy is really a computing platform for autonomous driving. And it's going to take a lot of software, and it's going to take a lot of software that is going to be owned by the car companies themselves. And our strategy is to provide a platform by which we provide a lot of the capabilities of artificial intelligence whereby they can embrace it, modify it, enhance it, so that they can make their personality of the driver experience in their own software long term. I just can't imagine how every single car company in the world will have exactly the same driver experience. The way that the car responds to you, the way that the car responds at all is something that I believe long term is going to require a lot of computing. This is an area that's just far from being done and I think it's very complicated stuff and we don't even know what we don't know yet. But the one thing that we do know, it's going to need a lot of computing horsepower, it's going to need a lot of software. Artificial intelligence is going to be at the core of it. And I think if we succeed in doing so, we're going to make the world a much, much better place. There are a lot of people that shouldn't drive. There are a lot of people that would love to get around, but they can't drive and I think we're going to keep a lot of people out of harm's way, so I think the work is incredibly important. It's far from being over and so there's lots to do.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Joseph Zaccaria with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nJoseph W. Zaccaria - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to circle back on the automotive part of the business. I know you have done a lot of work with the VW Group, specifically with Audi and Porsche. I was wondering if you have seen any of the impact from the potential R&D clawbacks or any sort of comments on what you are seeing out of Germany would be helpful? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: The area where we work with VW and Porsche and Audi are really about advancing the state-of-the-art in their cars. If you look at the work that we do, it's really about innovation and it's about the technology that they want to be world's first at bringing to market. This is a company \u2013 this is an organization that believes the technology leadership and leaning forward, leaning into the software-defined car and leaning into the computerized car and leaning into driver autonomous driving and leaning into electric vehicles is a good thing. This is a company that is very forward thinking as everybody is very well aware of. And so, our work with them are really along those areas and if anything at all, we see quite a significant heightened desire to move the company forward and do something great.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to you, please continue with the presentation and/or closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. There are several things that we wanted to say. We wanted to say that our new business model, transition approach to market is working and accelerating. We talked about our multiple growth market drivers, PC gaming data center and automotive are all growing nicely. We talked about the fact that we're working at the center of some big developments that are shaping the future of computing. AI, VR, accelerated cloud computing and autonomous driving cars, these are really exciting things. And we're doing that with one singular leveraged investment around one architecture and that allows us to bring the might of this company and the expertise that we have to help solve some of the problems that I have mentioned. NVIDIA is the world leader in visual computing and it's becoming more important than ever in a growing number of industries. Our strategy is to leverage this one core investment to four growth markets, gaming, professional visualization, data center and auto, and is delivering good results and gaining momentum. And so, our goal is to balance those investments, our investment to capture the enormous opportunity ahead while maintaining a keen focus on improving near-term financial performance. Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. Second quarter revenue was $1.15 billion, up 5% from a year earlier and well above our forecast of $1.01 billion. Growth was driven by our GTX gaming platform's continued momentum, the gaming markets underlying strengths, and increased automotive sales. Viewed from a segment perspective, GPU revenue was $959 million, up 9% year-over-year. Tegra processor revenue was $128 million, down 19% from a year earlier. In the face of challenges on both the macro and semiconductor fronts, NVIDIA is executing well. Helped by our sharp focus and strong market positions, our strategy for creating platforms for gaming, enterprise graphics and virtualization, HPC and cloud, and automotive continues to serve us well as visual computing becomes increasingly more important in these industries. In Q2, these four platforms contributed 85% of our revenue, up from 68% a year earlier. First, let's start with gaming. A market that's global and growing. Sales of PC gaming systems this year are estimated at $28 billion, with continued expansion expected; eSports, professional online gaming competitions is now a major entertainment category, with a growing audience of 130 million. This week's championship tournament of Dota 2 offers a purse of $18 million compared with $10 million for the PGA Open golf event, and there are now over 80 million people enjoying multiplayer online battle arena games, twice that of three years ago. Our gaming revenue rose 59% year-on-year to $661 million. This exceptional performance reflects the buoyant gaming market as well as the continued strength of our Maxwell-based GeForce GPUs for the enthusiast and performance categories. The newly launched flagship GTX 980 Ti has received outstanding reviews. AnandTech, for example, called it the card that all other high-end video cards are measured against. Across all regions gamers are flocking to advanced GPUs to play enormously popular games with high production values like Grand Theft Auto V and Witcher 3. Demand is also being driven by excitement around new gaming technologies including 4K, VR and DirectX 12. During the quarter, we rolled out SHIELD Android TV, a revolutionary device that connects your TV to an infinite world of infotainment. The world's first 4K smart TV, SHIELD was created for a new age of television, where movie, music, games and apps are delightfully simple to enjoy on one platform. SHIELD is the first of the next-generation smart TV devices. The first were streamers like Chromecast and Roku, the next will feature 4K powerful processors and rich app stores. We are excited to take SHIELD globally as supply comes online and exciting applications become available. Moving to enterprise; our enterprise graphics and virtualization revenues declined 14% year-on-year to $187 million. Our Quadro business was hampered by the weak refi cycle and workstation market. We look forward to launch in the year's second half of workstations based on Windows 10, Intel's Skylake and new Quadro GPUs. We continue to make good headway with our GRID virtualization platform, which enables companies to deliver graphic-rich applications like design tools from Adobe and Autodesk to employees on any device anywhere. The number of GRID customers has more than tripled in the past year to over 300 from a broad range of industries. Among the more than 40 customers added this quarter are the University of Southern California; Textron, the maker of Bell Helicopters; and Gensler, the global architectural firm. Nearly a quarter of the Fortune 100 are now in trials or in deploying GRID. In HPC and cloud, revenue declined 15% year-on-year to $62 million, reflecting lumpiness from major deep learning projects. We strengthened our offerings in the rapid growing field of deep learning, building on momentum from our March GPU Technology Conference. We launched digits two, (7:30), GPU accelerated software, the double's deep learning performance for data scientists and researchers. Deep learning adoption continues to grow with multiple developers for voice recognition platforms serving vast numbers of consumers. We are now engaged with more than 3,300 developers and companies interested in this area. Moreover, nearly 30,000 professionals on LinkedIn identified themselves as having proficiency in CUDA, our language for programming GPUs. In addition, GPU computing in the cloud continues to gather momentum with multiple leading cloud services providers offering GPU computing resources. We are also excited by the opportunities presented by President Obama's call last week for the U.S. to build an exascale supercomputer, one 30 times faster than today's most powerful systems. Just as GPU technologies are being used to build the pre-exascale computers coming online in the years ahead, we believe they will be important for exascale. Finally, automotive revenue rose 76% year-over-year to $71 million. Momentum here continues with new design at new and existing customers. Hitting the road this quarter in North America, for example, is Audi's TT sports car, which features a full digital dashboard powered by Tegra. In addition to our infotainment cockpit business, we are working with more than 50 companies interested in using NVIDIA DRIVE PX in their autonomous driving efforts. Last quarter, we announced our intention to sell or wind down, our Icera modem operations. In the absence of a viable buyer, we are winding it down. Accordingly, we have incurred this quarter $103 million in restructuring charges, net of tax. GAAP gross margin was 55.0% and incorporates our warranty provision for SHIELD tablet. Non-GAAP gross margins was 56.6%, in line with our outlook. Margins were slightly lower than the previous quarter as the strength of GeForce GTX revenue was offset by a lower mix of enterprise and accelerated computing GPUs. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $558 million, inclusive of $89 million of restructuring and other expenses associated with the wind down of Icera modem operations. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $421 million, including litigation charges slightly below our outlook. GAAP net income was $26 million and GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.05 including $0.19 charge for Icera and $0.02 charge for the recall. Non-GAAP net income was $190 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.34. Earnings grew 13% year-over-year. Now turning to some key balance sheet items. In Q2, our cash and marketable securities balance was $4.51 billion. During the second quarter, we paid $52 million in cash dividends and $400 million associated with an accelerated repurchase agreement. As a result, we returned an aggregate of $452 million to shareholders following $99 million in the first quarter. Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2016 to be $1.18 billion, plus or minus 2%. We remain excited about our business prospects. Gaming continues to accelerate, and 4K, VR, Windows 10, and a pipeline of exciting games will lift it further. GPU accelerated data centers are expanding. Deep learning is a new, exciting application. And the market for car computers is expanding. We have excellent positions in each of these growth markets. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 56.2% and 56.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is slightly below Q2 margins, reflecting our product mix. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $484 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $435 million. We expect fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat with fiscal year 2015, excluding litigation costs, which are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 are expected to be 22% and 20% respectively, plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges, which are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the second half of fiscal 2016. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?\nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nHarlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good afternoon. And solid job on the quarterly execution. If I look at the pipeline of blockbuster games coming down the pipe in October and November, Rainbow Six, Fallout 4, Black Ops 3 and so on, I mean, this is shaping up to be a stellar year for new game releases. And then on top of that GTX 980 Ti seems to be doing very well in the market. Why wouldn't we expect more seasonal growth in the business here for October? I guess the question is maybe offsetting that, are you guys still seeing headwinds in the enterprise and cloud or PC OEM segments in Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Harlan, there are several, I would say, four major drivers in the gaming industry. The first one is blockbuster titles, as you mentioned. The install base of game platforms is growing, so greatly that developers can now invest an enormous amount into production value of great games. In the second half you're going to see some pretty amazing games. I mean, you didn't mention Star Wars. Myself along with everybody else are practically out of our minds waiting for it. And I think this is going to be a huge game. Call of Duty, of course, Assassin's Creed, of course. Metal Gear Solid is going to be huge. The second half of the year, we're going to see some really huge games. The second dynamic is just eSports; eSports is probably the most social gaming platform that we have. And the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And it's also a form of gaming where milliseconds could make the difference between winning or losing, so performance of your platform matters a great deal. And it's a solely PC phenomenon. And it's a global phenomenon. In just a few years' time, eSports has doubled to almost 100 million gamers around the world. And this is, as I mentioned, is social. And so therefore, the network effect is quite important. And that's why you can imagine it doubling in just a few short years. And the larger the numbers, it just seems like the larger the numbers become. And the third driver for gaming this holiday season is the combination of several platforms coming together, finally. 4K is here. The pricing is fantastic now. Windows 10 is great. And the Skylake platform from Intel is going into production now. And then the fourth driver is a driver that we all have heard a great deal about, and surely the experience is as wonderful as the promise, is VR. And VR will go into production the second half of the year. Each one of these drivers are a pretty large scale. And so, I would agree with you that my expectation would be that gaming is going to continue to grow, and high-end gaming particularly is going to grow nicely. The guidance that we provided is guidance that we think makes sense at this time. And then, we'll report on how it turns out at the end of the quarter.\nHarlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for that Jen-Hsun. And then, the team has got this great pipeline of auto design wins. And with the new model changeover that's happening now that you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, how is this expanding the number of new models that are rolling out here in the second half of the year, that are using the Tegra platform, and that you'll also be recognizing revenue on a go-forward basis? I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, is auto contributing to the growth in Q3 and second half of this year?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Let's see. Well, auto is growing over 70% a year. We have eight million cars on the road now. We have 30 million more cars coming with our Tegra platform in it. And our recent initiative of utilizing deep learning in our CUDA processors, the Tegra processors, for autonomous driving is really gaining a lot of traction. We're now in engagement with about 50 companies around the world developing autonomous vehicles. The advantage that we have is the ability to capture camera inputs from all around the car. In addition to other sensors from lidar to radar to sonar. And sensor fusion is just such an important part of autonomous driving that this Tegra platform, we call it the DRIVE PX platform, is really incredibly valuable to the car companies. And so, we're developing autonomous driving vehicles with many of them at the moment. And so, I expect the car business to continue to grow and hard to exactly to say how it's going to do the second half. It depends on how many cars get sold. But there's no question at all that year-over-year, the growth is going to be steady. And it's going to keep going for several years.\nHarlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks a lot, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Harlan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, first one for you, if I could, in terms of VR, as you mentioned that some of the new products will go into production early this year, but as far as a bigger demand inflection for that technology goes, approximately when would you think that would be really taking off in terms of unit volumes and also helping to uplift your GPU business further? And related to that, just given that you have a lot of development on the software side, as well as on the hardware products in terms of your SHIELD products, does it make sense for NVIDIA to go more vertically integrated for VR products?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: So, the first question is, it's hard to say, but we know that several hundred thousand development kits were sold of the Oculus glasses. And if we just take a couple 200,000 to 300,000, they tend to require higher end GPUs because you're driving stereo. You need to have extremely low latency and you need to have 90 frames a second, so that you don't see flicker, all right. And so, those factors combined requires you to have a relatively high-end GPU. Several hundred thousand new high-end GPUs at several hundred dollars apiece adds up a bit. And that would be for the first year. It's hard to say exactly how big the VR market becomes ultimately, but if you've had a chance to try it, it's really a whole new experience. Being immersive just doesn't begin to explain how wonderful it is. And so, I think the buzz around VR, from all the people that have experienced it and the content developers that have spoken so highly of it, is consistent with the reality at this point. It's taken many years, well, many decades, frankly several decades to have brought VR to this point, and I think it surely looks like it's ready. To the question of what can we do more in VR, there's quite a bit that we can do in VR and we're working with Oculus and we're working with Valve to really integrate the entire rendering pipeline, the entire experience into a seamless one. That's an extraordinary amount of work to do already. In the other industries, we're going to see a lot of adoption in VR. This is an area where our work station business, our Quadro business is going to get a really great lift. And the reason for that, of course, is being able to see and experience a product in virtual reality before you manufacture it. And so, whether you're designing a building, or designing a car, or creating a showroom, the ability to be able to put on VR and experience it before you build it is quite an extraordinary benefit. And so, we're going to see some exciting adoption in the design community as well. So, there's plenty of work to do, plenty of innovation at the rendering layer for us to do. And so, I think that's plenty for now.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you for that, Jen-Hsun, and as my follow-up for Colette, on the OpEx side for the October quarter, can you talk about some of the puts and takes for the OpEx spend and what the main driver for the sequential increase for non-GAAP OpEx is? Thank you.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Stephen. So, when we look at Q3, Q3 has a couple key things in it, as we get ready for the holiday season, revenue-related OpEx, as we think of marketing and others, is also in our Q3. It is also the time that we take the opportunity to look at the salaries of our employees. So, our overall salary increases for worldwide do take place in Q3.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya calling from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question. Very good results, very good growth in gaming, but, Jen-Hsun, I just wanted to go back to the quarter you reported, I'm wondering what changed versus your original expectations, were you just too conservative before or what changed in the quarter to really create this kind of positive surprise, and how are you making sure there is no buildup of excess inventory, given just broad macro conditions seem so volatile right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, answering the second part first. We monitor sell-out in the channel literally every day. And so, that's how we manage inventory. We don't manage inventory on sell-in, we manage inventory on sell-out. And so, having our own specialized platforms, instead of selling into OEMs gives us a lot more visibility, frankly, than we've ever had before. As you know, we really changed our business model from a company that sold components to PC OEMs and OEMs, mobile OEMs. We're now focused on specialized platforms for specialized applications, and we have identified four applications where we could add a lot of value. And in each one of these four applications, we're so much closer to the marketplace that the visibility is just surely better. If you go back to the first part of your question, I think 90 days ago, just about everybody was rather uncertain about what was happening. There were a lot of changes going on around the world. Surely, there's still changes around the world, but for... (25:09 \u2013 25:19)\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Vivek, I think your plane is here.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Please go ahead.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's all right. It's all right. It's all right. So anyways, it's just that was the best we could do at the time and we provided the best judgment we had and it turned out to have been much better than that.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Jen-Hsun, as my follow-up, could you talk about your average content in the car? Where is it now? Where can it get to? Because I think you mentioned the 30 million cars. I think you have mentioned 25 million before. And if I take the 30 million cars and I'll tell you (25:58), it means it's roughly 10% share of all the cars that are sold in a given year, so you're penetrating just the high-end of the car. So, please talk about (26:12) what the direction is, if you could quantify that would be very useful. And then in terms of penetration, is it just the high-end or are you able to get into the midrange and on the mass market as well? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're trying to win as much as we can, while delivering value to the customers that we select. And our value proposition, as you can imagine, tends to be where visual computing is really important. And it could be because of large surround and dynamic infotainment systems, virtual cockpits, where you've got a digital dashboard and it's rich and it's moving and infotainment's integrated into it and maps integrated into it. It might have several virtual machines that are running at the same time, so that infotainment and digital clusters are not integrated into one computer, and it provides a safety among itself. It could be in the future several computers inside the car, some in the front, some in the back, as displays become more affordable and people's expectation for rich graphics continues to grow. You could expect us to have infotainment systems, virtual clusters, as well as drive computers, that are used for driver assistance or autonomous driving. And so, there's a lot of different ways that a computer is going to be included in cars. I think largely the trend is very, very clear that in the future, the best way to add value to products is to connect them to the Internet and make them computerized, make it a software-defined product. And I think your car's going to become a software-defined car. And the amount of processing inside will continue to grow at an exponential level. And as a visual computing company, we think we could add a lot of value here. And so, I think our software content is going to continue to grow. This isn't like our parents' car industry anymore. This is really a computerized car industry. And cars are going to be supercomputers in the future.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And one last one for Colette, if I may. Cash is almost 40% of the market cap now (28:37) lot of buybacks. I'm wondering, Colette, is still that's the best use of the cash or are there other options for the large cash that you've built up? Thank you.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks for the question. We tend to look at our cash balance, net of our debt as well, as we have about $1.5 billion outstanding debt. And then with our synthetic lease that we also just completed, we'll add on top of that. So, our net is probably a pretty good, a better barometer of what percentage of our value is associated. We've looked at our capital return program heavily. We are excited at the amount that we are returning this year, close to $800 million, which is nearly in the high percentage of our free cash flow. And we'll continue to look of opportunities for our cash, whether that be investment in the business, more capital return, and/or M&A. Thanks for the question.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag calling from Macquarie Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, thanks a lot for taking the question. Looks like the GTX 980 Ti had a very strong quarter. And based on third-party best, again it looks like it's extremely competitive with high bandwidth memory parts from your main competition. And I think it's something we all underestimated just the value of your software and the advantage that game provides you, despite maybe some technological changes on the silicon. And maybe you could talk about your GPU roadmap for next 12 months, 18 months and whether you think your software advantage could actually allow you to maintain share even before or without an architectural change.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Deepon, first of all, I appreciate the comment about the software, we are really, really proud of our software. And in the final analysis, a computer is not just a bunch of silicon, a computer is silicon and software and algorithms and system software and all kinds of stuff in the middle, and you can't just be a good transistor slinger, if you will, and you have to create, ultimately, a great experience. And in the final analysis NVIDIA is a visual computing company, which is everything that includes architecture and silicon and system software and algorithms and deep understanding of applications and everything in the middle and being able to optimize it across the entire stack, so, first of all, I appreciate that comment. However, it turns out that it's not solely because of our software that the Maxwell architecture delivers so much performance, even though the memory that we use is relatively available. And the reason for that is, because Maxwell includes a ground-breaking piece of memory technology inside the chip that compresses, reorders and does amazing things, so that we effectively received 1.5 times our bandwidth through amplification of compression and others. And so, it's a brand-new technique that has taken us several years to create, and as a result, we got a lot of effective bandwidth out of Maxwell because of that. The benefit of doing this approach, of course, is that we can scale it across the entire family of Maxwell GPUs, all the way from the TITAN X to the GTX 980 Ti to the GTX 980, to the GTX 970, to the GTX 960, and so we can take it all the way to the mainstream because of this technique. I think your question about long-term roadmap, I like to reserve the opportunity to surprise you with some new products in the future. However, one thing that I can tell you is this, and I think maybe you're alluding to it, people have observed us increasing performance 2X every year and a half for quite a long time. Two times, maybe even a year's timeframe. And we defied Moore's law. Well, the reason for that is because Moore's law isn't a transistor law necessarily, Moore's law is an innovation law, and we can innovate across multiple layers, from architecture to the silicon, to the silicon design, to all of the system components around it, to the algorithm on top, to the system software that you mentioned just now, great software. We can innovate across so many layers independently and together that we can bring value to the marketplace irrespective. For example, you were probably alluding to the fact that we stayed on 28-nanometer for quite a long time, and we did. And yet during that time, we increased performance by a factor of four to five in one node. And so, I expect that we'll be able to continue to do that.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for that. And maybe if I can talk about the workstation in the Tesla business. It seems like it slowed down a little bit in Q2 and, obviously, Tesla a lot of high-performance computing in cloud, customers are very lumpy in their purchases, but how should we think about the growth for the entire year, and if you expect some kind of acceleration either in Q3 or Q4?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we saw some slowdown in enterprise buying as other people have. And I would say that in the case of our workstation platform, it probably was also postponed because the new platform architecture from Intel was delayed by a little bit. And Skylake is a really excellent platform, it has a higher speed connectivity, it has the ability to support more memory and including DDR4 memory and in the space of workstation supported data set is very, very large and moving data in and out of the computer is so important, having that connectivity and IO capability is really important. And so, I think that along with everybody else, we're all delighted that Windows 10 is now out and Skylake is now ramping up production and hopefully the OEMs can launch a new line of great workstations. Long-term the way to think about it is this, and the way I look at it is Quadro is all about design and creativity, and there's no question that more and more people are using digital approaches to design things and create products. And so, so long as people design and create in digital, it's going to be a growth opportunity for Quadro. As for Tesla, it is a growing business, but it's still a lumpy business. And the reason for that is because every so often a data center comes in or a supercomputer comes in and buys tens of thousands of chips and to outfit a data center or outfit a supercomputer and so we're going to expect to see lumpiness. But the trend is clearly, clearly, is clearly visible. That accelerated computing is the way to the future. In fact, I don't think that we've ever experienced something like this, but President Obama, this last week, signed an executive order that multiple agencies in the government will collaborate with education and industry to create an exascale computing platform. Now, just to put that in perspective, exascale is literally 30 times faster than the fastest supercomputer we have in our country, and with President Obama's executive order, we're going to be able to create not only the world's fastest supercomputer, but 30 times faster than what we currently have in the United States. Now, just to help you understand some of the sentiments around that executive order, it's really to help the nation find a path forward in the post-Moore's law era and it says it so explicitly. In order to achieve an exascale computing capability in some reasonable time, without power going through the roof, let me just give you one example, in order to reach approximately one exascale in the next several years or half decade, we would need a power plant \u2013 if we just used CPUs alone, we would need a power plant of about a billion watts; that's effectively powering a computer with a nuclear power plant. However, using accelerating computing which is the way the TITAN supercomputer \u2013 which is the fastest supercomputer in America today powered by 18,000 NVIDIA GPUs, that consumes only 10 megawatts to 20 megawatts, which is about the power envelope, if you will, of a supercomputer today. And so, what we're going to do is, we're going to really endeavor to continue to advance in accelerated computing. It's very clear now this is the path forward and for many applications, whether it's life sciences, research or energy research or work in big data and artificial intelligence, that this approach to computing is really a fantastic way forward. And so, I'm very enthusiastic about Tesla.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Terrific.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann calling with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us the rundown on the competitive dynamics over the past quarter on the auto side? There's lots of players that are out there and it gets a little confusing, so if you can give us a rundown and who are the real guys long-term that could emerge as a competitive dynamic for you guys? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, let's see how to answer that. I guess there's several different places in the automotive industry where innovation is happening. I think largely infotainment is a relative commodity. It is possible to build infotainment systems relatively easily; however, a virtual digital cluster, where the digital dashboard, the mapping system, the infotainment system all unifies into one virtual display. That is relatively complicated work, and the reason for that is because there's several operating systems at play, it's a very powerful virtual computer, virtual machine that's running. And the quality of software needs to be utterly exquisite; otherwise problems in one functionality like infotainment system could cause all kinds of trouble for you with your digital clusters, so that's an area where we're doing a lot of very good work and we're finding a great deal of interest. And our software capability and the performance of our processors is a real advantage. Another place where we see a lot of traction is autonomous driving. In the first implementations, of course, it is driver assistance, observing something, an object in front of the car and applying the brakes if the car's not slowing down. That's relatively easy to do. But that's far, far, far away from autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles are going to require sensor fusion, radar's going to get involved, lidars will get involved in the future, sonars get involved, of course, and cameras all over the car. And so, this particular approach of autonomous driving, autonomous vehicle I think is a rather promising approach and is recognized around the world as a reasonable (40:42). And so, where sensor fusion comes in, the processing capability of Tegra and CUDA connected with smart cameras is a really wonderful approach going forward, and so that's one of the reasons why we're engaged with just about every autonomous platform that I know of anyways and the DRIVE PX is really doing well there.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Hans.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava calling with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, thank you. And Colette and Jen-Hsun if I missed it I apologize, I'm just trying to get a little bit more of my arms around the guidance for the third quarter. Based on the comments that you've provided, sounds like PC gaming will be up Q-over-Q and then auto's up, but what about PC OEM and the enterprise business? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, the PC OEM and the enterprise business, there are reasons to be optimistic. In the PC OEM business, of course, Windows 10 has come out and before it came out there's really no reason to buy a PC in advance of it. Skylake is out, and both of these platforms should contribute to growth. But, we'll see how it turns out. We don't control the PC OEMs, and we stay very close to them and whatever opportunities comes our way we'd surely be delighted with it. With respect to enterprise, I guess your guess is as good as ours and when the enterprises come back and purchase. I think our position with workstations, Quadro visualization is surely excellent and our position with accelerated computing with Tesla is surely excellent. Both of them are highly differentiated in the marketplace and their niche is very clear and the value we deliver is very clear. And so, when the enterprise comes back and buy, I think we're going to do very well. So, I think the answer is, we should just wait and see.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): For both Tesla and for Quadro, Jen-Hsun?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Both of those are highly dependent on enterprise buying cycles and enterprise purchases. And so I think, as I mentioned, I'm optimistic about both of them, I'm enthusiastic about both of their positions. And with respect to the guidance, the best thing to do is just wait and see.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill calling from Needham and Company. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results in light of the tough macro environment.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Given your new segment reporting or relatively new segment reporting, it kind of represents kind of a transformation in your business. You didn't give out the PC OEM revenue, but if I just back into it, it does seem like the PC OEM revenue is down another 50% year-over-year, if I did it correctly, after falling about 40% year-over-year in Q1. So, now the mix of the business is where PC OEM is now only 15% of sales down from, say, 30% of sales, at the start of last year. So, I just wanted to get a sense of is that correct? And the new growth segments, if you could talk a little about what's going on in gaming and auto because gaming and auto and enterprise are now almost 85% of revenue.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Raj, first of all, I appreciate the observation. If you look at it year-to-year, and I would just use rough CEO math here, year-to-year, our OEM business, PC OEM business and mobile OEM business are down nearly $200 million. Yet, the company grew about $50 million, which basically says that the specialized platform strategy and these four applications, these four markets that we've targeted, have made up, and some, the decline of OEMs. The benefit is even better than that, of course, as you surely would know. The resilience of the business is greater. The value that we add to the marketplace is much, much greater, which will eventually reflect itself in gross margins. The business model is more resilient, and our end market engagement is much deeper. And so, I think in just about every possible way, it's a hard quality business, it's a more resilient business, and it's a business that our shareholders, frankly, would enjoy better long-term. It gives us much larger growth opportunities; whereas a long time ago, I guess maybe a couple years ago, people asked why we could grow a $4 billion graphics business in a market that was only $4.8 billion large. Well, nobody would think twice if we could grow into $100 billion gaming market. And so, if we could add more and more value to a much larger end market, I think it's just a much better company. And I think that's all, you're observing is the transformation, the successful transformation, of our business model from a component business model to OEMs to a platform model with a specialty in an area that is related to visual computing.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: And just as a follow-up to that point, your gaming segment is now 57% of sales versus 38% of sales this time last year. And the growth rate actually accelerated year-over-year from Q1 to Q2. And I think what the market underappreciates is the gaming market itself and how fast that's growing. So, I was wondering if you could discuss, you did a little bit before, but why is the gaming market so robust and is there anything going on by region? Any color there as well in addition to your commentary earlier in the call?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: There are several dynamics that are happening. And it's very, very mathematical. The first dynamic is the size of the market is growing and it's driven a lot by eSports and MOBA. This is a type of game that's quite viral and it is also very social. And it has the ability to grow to larger numbers whenever we reach larger numbers. And it has a network effect. And the reason for that is because you want to play with your friends. And if two of your friends are already playing a particular game and you want to hang out with them, and when they're playing, they're talking, and they're enjoying each other's company, they're hanging out, then the third friend's going to get invited and the fourth and the fifth and before you know it just about all your friends are playing. And so it tends to work in a social effect and it grows from large numbers. The second is the production value of games. I don't know if you've noticed or not, they're almost cinematic now. And that's made possible because of the rich algorithms that we put on top of our GPUs, we call GameWorks, because of our GPUs. And when the production value is high, it consumes a lot more GPU. It's very different than movies. A Blu-ray movie, whether it's beautiful or not so beautiful, is basically Blu-ray. But for computer games, in order to have beautiful games, you need more powerful GPUs, and so that's very mathematical. And the third is 4K displays is a lot more pixel than 1080p, 8 million pixels over 2 million pixels. It's a lot more pixels. And the number of pixels we can process is directly related to the power of the GPUs. And then all of a sudden, you add VR on top of that. And so, you need very high-resolution displays. You need two of them because you're in stereo and you also want to render it at a much, much higher frame rate. Instead of 30 frames a second, you want to render it at 90 frames a second. And so, it's times two times three. And so many of these type of experiences are driving the GPU adoption upward. And we're definitely seeing that trend. So, both the larger market and increasing adoption of higher end GPUs. And that's what you're basically seeing.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Excellent color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nJiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Jen-Hsun. Given that gaming is slated to grow up over 20% year-on-year this year, how should we think about growth longer term? And Colette, how can we think about the gross margin impact from the growth of gaming?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: That's a good question, Ross (sic) [Ji Yoo] (50:35). And let's see, how do you think about it? I guess the way I think about it is, it's related to the number of gamers. It's related to the production value of games. And so long as the number of gamers continue to grow and the number of gamers have practically doubled in MOBA in the last three years to almost 100 million gamers. And yet 100 million gamers is not that many gamers in the context of people who watch television. And we know that just about every young adult is a gamer today. And so, it stands to reason that gaming is going to be a very, very large industry. And almost everybody is going to game. It's about $100 billion today. It's hard to say exactly how big it's going to get. But it's hard for me to imagine that it would stay at $100 billion. And so, those things hopefully will continue to drive the growth of gaming. And our dedication to the space, the investments that we've made over the course of nearly two decades in the space, has really put us in this opportunity to benefit from this growth. Okay. Go ahead.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And then further on your question of gross margins for gaming, we reviewed our gross margins by our market platforms on our Analyst Day, really kind of highlighting the success of our strategy in these platforms. And so many of them have higher gross margins than our company average. So, yes, we can benefit from gaming, which does have a slightly higher gross margin company average right now. Of course, there's always mix factors that come into play each quarter. But it does help contribute to our great success that we've been showing on our gross margin over the last couple quarters.\nJiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And sorry, yes, this is Ji Yoo for Ross Seymore. As for the follow-up question, you discussed the lumpiness of spending from customers in deep learning. We've seen CapEx cuts from the likes of cloud customers. So, what are you hearing from cloud customers in terms of slowing of their data center and cloud build-outs for the year? Or are they cutting CapEx in other areas besides data center and cloud?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I really appreciate that question. In fact, we see the most success when there's pressure on CapEx. And it seems counter intuitive, but the reason for that is this: the consumption of flops, and the need for fast searches, whether it's voice search, natural language processing and translation of voice, image search, transcoding of images, when you send video up in one resolution, they want to maybe store it or transcode it or stream it in a different resolution. The ability to take poor video and enhance it, herky-jerky video, and all of a sudden you stabilize the video and make it beautiful. All of that video processing and all of that search is going to require the data center to be much, much more powerful. And the benefit of GPUs is that by adding GPUs, you don't have to incur a great deal of expense, but you can increase the performance of your data center tremendously. Let me give you the case in point: we increased the performance of the Oak Ridge supercomputer by a factor of 10. By a factor of 10, with just 18,000 GPUs. It was a retrofit. The most powerful supercomputer in our nation today, it's a retrofit. It's a retrofit of an existing supercomputer. And so, if you could imagine retrofitting data centers with GPUs, it would increase the throughput, the computational throughput, arguably by a factor of 10 just like we've done for the Oak Ridge supercomputer. And as a result, the CapEx doesn't have to go up very much. So, that's one of the benefits of acceleration. It takes advantage of your current infrastructure, and you can improve its capability by upgrading it with a GPU.\nJiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks very much. What percentage of desktops sold currently do you consider to be gaming desktops? And what would be the answer for notebooks?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: David, I'm not sure \u2013 one more time, what is...?\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, you're talking about...\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: In dollars, the gentleman earlier had already decoded our OEM sales. Our PC OEM sales represents only a few percentage of our total revenues now.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: And so, that's a way to think about it. And gaming, of course, is a very large percentage of our revenues.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: No, but I'm not talking about your revenues. I'm talking about the overall market, if one considers the market of desktops. So, what percentage of units of desktops do you consider gaming, that are taking up your gaming GPUs?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I see. Very good question. Incredibly small, surprising. And the reason for that is this: most gamers buys a PC and then upgrades it maybe three, four cycles. Does that make any sense to you? They buy our GeForce cards directly from ETAIL, they take it home, they pull it out of the box, they install it into their computer, and sometimes they cut a hole in it, so that it can see the graphics card. Sometimes they paint the chassis with car paint, so that they can personalize it, fall in love with it, and they upgrade it for years to come.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And on a second matter, Tesla. I think last quarter you kindly provided us the revenue. I think it was $79 million. What was it this quarter?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It was \u2013 hold on \u2013 in our thing. It is $62 million this quarter.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You're welcome.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks for getting me in. And congratulations on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, I'm wondering, you talked about 50 incremental designs in a driver assist, as well as maybe 30 more million units. Does that 50 more customers totally encompass that 30 million, or is there more on top of that to come? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks for the question, Alex. Most of the 50 are new customers. And the reason for that is because the number of companies that are working on autonomous driving cars are not just necessarily car companies. Car companies are going to invest in more and more autonomous capabilities. However, there are many companies who are creating autonomous cars that could be used as a service. And so, you're going to see the car industry bifurcate in some really exciting and interesting ways. On the one hand, car companies are going to make cars more capable and safer and more joyful to drive. On the other hand, you're going to see new startup companies, and maybe exciting startup companies, that create fleets of autonomous vehicles that are operated as a service. And so they come at the world very differently. And autonomous vehicles come in a lot of shapes and forms. They're not all passenger cars. And so, this is an area of a lot of very exciting development. And we're working with a lot of them because we have a platform that was really designed to fuse computer vision cameras from all around the car as well as radars and lidars and sonars, and be able to do path planning and all of those kind of capabilities that you're going to need for an autonomous vehicle.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Congratulations again. Great quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia calling from Nomura Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hey, Jen-Hsun. One question on the gaming growth. If I look at combined discrete GPU market between NVIDIA and AMD, if my estimates are right, AMD lost roughly 300 million in discrete GPU market from 2014 to 2015. And you are gaining 300 million, roughly. So, if I look at the whole discrete gaming market between both of you, it would appear it's stable. So, how do I reconcile this and the commentary that the gaming is growing for you? Is it growing for the \u2013 between both of you or is it growing for you? I just wanted to understand how would you reconcile this?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, you know AMD's business a lot better than I do, surely. But I can't imagine the math working out. The GPU business is larger than it has ever been. And so, I can't imagine that being a share gain. And the applications that we're in are applications that have never been conceived as before. And so, I can't imagine it being something that's a shared gain matter. And so, whether it's in deep learning, whether it's the growth of MOBAs, the number of gamers around the world that are engaging in eSports and MOBA is surely an increase. The gaming market in Southeast Asia's growing, the gaming market in Latin America is growing, the gaming market in China continues to grow even through a slower economy. People are just getting born and they grow up and one day they discover that their other friend's game, and they get into gaming and so I think the number of gamers of the next-generation is more than the gamers of the previous generation. And I think all of that is very logical and it's kind of sensible. And so, that's kind of how we see it. And we're really not correlated at all to anything that AMD's doing anymore. Not that I...\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. As a follow-up question on GRID, so you're at several thousands of customers and just wondering what feedback, what issues, concerns that you have seen that may be taking longer for it to ramp?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate that. Thanks for that opportunity to answer the question. Enterprise trials surely takes a long time, but the benefit of an enterprise business is that it remains sticky for a very long time. This time last year we've deployed 100 customers and today we've deployed 300 customers. Our partnership with VMware is on full steam. You probably heard from their conference call and their commentary how enthusiastic they are about end user computing. And since Horizon supported vGPU in the last couple of quarters, the engagement across the board is just incredibly high and the pipeline is very healthy. And so, I think this is an area in enterprise computing that's just going to take time and this is a long-term bet, but there's no question in my mind that the value of virtualizing an enterprise end-to-end, because of heterogeneous computing, because of security, because data is getting so large, it is better to keep it in the data center, and because people's work styles are more mobile and more flexible than ever, these dynamics are not going to go away. And virtualization of the PC applications that are not going to go away either that are relied upon by enterprises all over the world, virtualizing those applications is really the right way to go forward in modernizing your company. And so, I have a lot of enthusiasm and faith in this product line and it appears that the rest of the IT industry is equally excited about it.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much, Jen-Hsun.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Co. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Craig.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Jen-Hsun, just starting off with a higher level question that cycles back to Analyst Day. At Analyst Day, you highlighted four platforms with secular growth dynamics to them. With some of the softness that we've recently seen in the macro, does that have any impact on the growth that you would expect intermediate term from those four platform groups; gaming, auto, enterprise, and HPC and cloud?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the interesting thing is wherever an enterprise gets involved, we are surely affected by slowdown. However, when our products are bought and sought out one at a time, we tend to experience what the large industry would experience. So, in the case of gaming, it's a consumer product, it's a consumer market. And people buy the product not because they can afford it, necessarily. They buy the product because they want to play the game. And so, when a new game comes out and it's too good not to play, something like Star Wars or something like Call of Duty or something like League of Legends, it's just too good not to play. People will find a way to afford one of the GeForce graphic cards. And in the case of cars, the car industry is moving forward in autonomous vehicles and cars are becoming more and more computerized and irrespective of the economy, the high-end segments of the car market seems to be doing quite well. And maybe oil prices have something to do with that as well, but we're seeing just a really exciting adoption in the higher end segments of the market where new technology is really transforming the car. And then with respect to deep learning, I think the jury is now, well, I was going to say, it's pretty clear now that deep learning has an opportunity to make a real difference in computer science. Using a large amount of data to write the software itself is a pretty astonishing development. And our GPU business is making it practical to train networks that are trained and taught by just an enormous amount of data, has really opened up this field for rapid innovation. And so, we're seeing a lot of excitement there. And so, these platforms that we talked about I think are exciting and making contributions on fundamental levels, and I'm hopeful that we'll continue to grow through the rest of the year.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks. The follow-up is for Colette. Colette, on the base band wind down, can you just provide some more detail with regards to what you'd expect with the cost for that coming out of the system? I understand that you've said you're going to reinvest that and there's legal expenses this year, but can you give us a few more time lines related to that exit?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, we had started a good portion of the wind down of the business in Q2. We are still working on shutting down that piece, so we have a couple pieces which is reflective of our restructuring charges that we planned for Q3 associated with it. So, we're just nearly done, but we still have a couple open issues that we're working through on that. As related to what we are going to invest in, as we've talked about on the call, we talked about the deep learning, really thinking about the automotive business, and of course, in terms of gaming and those investments to assure where we are well positioned for going forward. However, our overall plan, excluding the overall litigation expenses is to still be flat OpEx year-over-year with fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. Just to give you a little bit of color in terms of what we're planning on there and if you have anything further just let us know.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Just a follow-up there. Will restructuring charges conclude in the fiscal third quarter or will they carry into the fourth quarter?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Again, it's a little hard for us to determine that. We commented on them mainly as the second half as we are still working through with those employees on their exit. So, I can't conclude that they would be in Q3 and they may move into Q4.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets & Co. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys. So looks like stand-alone GPU purchases and pure gaming products, they're becoming a larger percentage of sales and mix, particularly as discrete GPUs kind of mix down here. So, should we be looking at Q4 differently now? Does the holiday season have more impact now than it's had in prior years? And could this be a year where we get better than typical seasonality?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think we ought to just enjoy a seasonality first and then we'll come back and comment on it. What really drives our business, what really drives our business are the games that come out, the quality of the games, the production value of the games, and the global growth of gaming. United States is not very much a \u2013 well, let me just say opposite. United States is very much a game console market. And the reason for that is very clear. We have the benefit of family rooms and people have their own bedrooms. But around the world, especially markets that are just developing and growing, the PC platform is a platform that every family needs and every individual needs anyways, and so they tend to be a PC gaming market. And in addition to that, because of eSports and MOBA, which is very clearly the most exciting area of gaming today, that is largely a PC phenomenon. And so, those are really the factors that drive our growth. And this second half of the year, we're really fortunate to have some amazing, amazing titles coming out whether it's Star Wars or Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear Solid, these are franchise titles with just an enormous number of players that are waiting for it, and so I'm looking for it as well and hopefully it will drive for a good season.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. In autonomous driving, your main competitor some consider a monopoly in the space. They're only spending maybe $40 million a year in R&D. You spend probably 30 times that in your total company and I'm pretty sure you'd feel comfortable spending multiples of that just on the autonomous driving segment. So do you guys see this as an opportunity for you guys kind of lower hanging fruit here? How should we view spending, how you're thinking about this, and just a smaller one, how do we sort of split your R&D between software and hardware spend in the area?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, well, we don't spend all that on autonomous driving, of course. We're a visual computing company with four platforms and one of our platforms is autonomous driving or Drive, which is our car platform. Our approach to \u2013 the current market for what is called ADAS, driver assistance, relies on a smart camera, if you will. It's a camera that can detect objects. And objects of a certain list. And in the future, autonomous driving is surely more than detecting objects, and it will surely require more than cameras. You can't drive in the dark. You can't see in the dark if you can't see. You know, and so having cameras alone is not good enough. And for cars using lidars and using radars and sonars and cameras all over the car, that is what the industry calls sensor fusion to realize insight by fusing the input of multiple sensors. And in our case, we're going to use deep learning the same approach that we've been using for much of the work that we do and that's been talked about in deep learning to assist and to help realize this vision of an autonomous vehicle. Along the way, of course, we're going to have all kinds of capabilities. And the benefit of our approach is \u2013 it's very compatible with smart cameras. And so, most of the platforms that we're in today, in fact, are harmoniously working with smart cameras that are either home grew or bought from a third-party. And also processing on our platform. And so, we see it as a compatible path to the future. And the road to autonomous driving is \u2013 there's lots of innovation yet. And your last question was, Chris?\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah, just in terms of your spend on that part, call it ADAS in autonomous, what's software and what's hardware, how do you sort of split that out or think about it?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, just the company largely is a software company and the reason for that is because we're about algorithms. And if you look at the company, although we're well-known for building some of the most complex processors in the world, that represents probably about a third of our engineers. Two-thirds of our engineers are algorithm experts and computational mathematicians and system software experts and so on and so forth. And so, that's pretty consistent in ADAS as well. We're about two-thirds software.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about DirectX 12. What kind of impact you think that might have. I know these things don't come along that often, but does that have a strong impact in any one short period, or is that sort of more drawn out over time?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Boy, I cannot wait for DirectX 12. And the reason for that is DX12 has been re-architected particularly in the geometry perimetive part of the pipeline. It can now process geometry with much, much lower load on the CPU than ever before. And so, the benefit is that we're going to be able to pump through a lot more geometric fidelity, a lot more geometry processing into the GPU. And so, you're going to see just much, much more beautiful graphics. On the other hand, it takes a lot of pressure off the CPU. And the CPU can now be used for other type of tasks, network more players and deal with scenes that has a lot more characters, maybe more artificial intelligence algorithms, and making your opponent, if you will, the computer opponent smarter. And so, you're going to be able to do a lot more things with DX12. I'm super excited about it.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then I just have a question. You guys have talked in the past a little bit about using FPGAs to accelerate servers versus graphics. Given the importance that Intel's placing now on FPGA server acceleration, how do you see the value proposition of Tesla in that same space?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that, first of all, I guess, at this point a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing is an essential part of future scaling in the what is called, the post- Moore's law era. And accelerated computing can come in a lot of different forms. An FPGA is a configurable computer, and so if you don't have that many different types of algorithms, and you can afford the expense and the difficulty of designing an FPGA, you can get results. It's basically designing your own customer chip that runs slower because ASICs are faster. But still, you're designing a customer chip. On the other hand, a GPU is not about designing, it's about programming. And so, if you have large different types of algorithms, you're changing your algorithms on a regular basis, the throughput that you get with a GPU that we've built, which is arguably already the most complex that any processor has ever been built anyhow. And so, it gives you a lot more flexibility. And so, these are all spectrums, if you will, of accelerated computing. But, the thing that is really fantastic is finally on a very, very large scale and across the industry the recognition that accelerated computing is the path forward.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, Jen-Hsun, when you look at PC gaming and strength and sustainability into the back half, it looks like you came in about 150 million more than what you were thinking at least initially for the guidance. I'm curious if there's any sort of color you can provide there in terms of mix, higher ASP strength geographically? And then looking at the second half of the year, first half fiscal 2016's growing about 40% year-over-year. How should we think about the second half versus the first half, particularly given those four drivers that you outlined at the early part of the call?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, let me answer the second one first and maybe Colette can help you with the first one. On the second one, the thing that I feel much more confident in answering is our position in the market and the health of that market. I am pretty sure that gaming is a large-scale phenomenon and growing. I'm pretty sure that MOBA is a social network, that when you're playing games, you're hanging out with your friends, and when some of your friends are hanging out on MOBA, you've got to join it, otherwise you don't get to hang out, and so the reason why these large markets get larger. The benefit of a very large market is that finally developers, publishers, can invest several hundred million dollars in building a new game of extraordinary production value and launch it into a very large market. The benefit of a large production value game to us is that it needs really, really great GPUs. And so, those positive feedback systems, those positive feedback effects, are things that I understand very, very well. Now, how's the seasonal buying in the second half and exactly how many percent and how many we're going to sell it's kind of harder for me to tell. But, I do know that our gaming business is quite robust. On the other stream, I know what I know about the autonomous vehicles and the processing that is necessary to achieve and realize that dream and where we are on that dream. We're still quite a ways from it, in fact, to do something that we can really, really count on. And then on accelerated computing, I'm pretty confident at this point that accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, in that it has been recognized around the industry and globally that this is a very good approach forward, both for supercomputing, already adopted by our nation's fastest supercomputer, but and also the recognition by the presidential initiative to adopt methods to bring exascale to the marketplace in the next several years. Accelerated computing will surely be required. And so, I think that those things I feel very strongly about and I think it's pretty clear our position within each one of those are very good.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. And to help answer your question regarding our performance in the quarter on gaming and how well it did and where did it come from in terms of is that ASP, is that volume, is it region? And the answer to that is yes, yes, and yes. The value that we delivered in our high GTX cards were truly well received by the market. That high value affords us a great ASP and a great revenue growth. We've seen tremendous volume over this quarter as well, which has helped us; but thirdly, which I think is important, is all regions from a sell-through are also performing very well.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Very helpful. Thank you.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, I think with that we have one more question for the group. Operator, if we can take that last question.\nOperator: Certainly. The last question comes from the line of Matthew Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Please proceed.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jen-Hsun, as you may appreciate, there's been a little bit of angst in the investor community regarding the Chinese consumer, given all that's gone on over there in the stock market et cetera and it seems like your gaming business has obviously done quite well and maybe you could talk a little bit about the concentration of your gaming business that maybe ends up in China and how the trends are playing out in that market overall, because it seems you guys are doing much better than folks might appear? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I appreciate the question. About 40%, I guess. Just shy of 40% of our total gaming business is in China. The Chinese market is surprisingly resilient, because most of the games are free to play. It is probably one of the most affordable form of entertainment that you can possibly imagine. And, as I mentioned earlier, these networked games are really social environments. They're social networks. One of the reasons why Tencent grew so fast in China. Once the social network gets traction, it grows faster than linear. And so, there's some reasons why the Chinese market is more resilient, the gaming market is more resilient than expected. We're also seeing a shift to higher end GPUs in China. Some of that probably has to do with the dramatic change in improvement in production value of games in China. There was a time when the Chinese games were enjoyed and fun. However, the production values weren't very good, but now if you take a look at the Tencent games, the production value are absolutely phenomenal. They're beautiful. They're artistic and in those cases require a lot more GPU capability. And so, we're seeing multiple dynamics happening in China and they all seem to be quite healthy.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: All right, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn it back to the speakers for their closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, everybody, and I'll talk to you next quarter.\nColette M.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. First quarter revenue increased 4% year over year to $1.15 billion. Growth was driven by the strength in gaming, high-performance computing and cloud, and automotive. Viewed from a segment perspective, GPU revenue was $940 million, up 5% year over year. Tegra processor revenue was $145 million, up 4% year over year. NVIDIA's business performed within expectations within the quarter. Our strategy of creating specialized platforms for gaming, enterprise, high-performance computing and cloud, and automotive continues to gain traction, and we continue to reshape our organization to focus on them. In Q1, these four growth platforms contributed to more than 80% of revenue, up from 68% a year ago. Gaming revenue was $587 million, up 25% year over year, powered by the strength of our Maxwell GPU architecture. Helping our performance was the launch of TITAN X, the world's fastest GPU. TITAN X, introduced at the Game Developers Conference, sets a new standard, with the outstanding capabilities to drive 4K games and virtual reality titles. It delivers twice the performance and double the power efficiency of its predecessor. We also announced SHIELD, the world's first 4K smart TV device. SHIELD delivers video, music apps, and high-quality games, and uses Google Voice Search. It's powered by our Tegra X1 processor. The gaming market continues to expand. In the second half, we look forward to multiple drivers, including 4K, which quadruples the number of pixels to process, virtual reality, and the launch of Windows 10. Enterprise revenue was $190 million, down 4% year over year due to the weakness in European currencies. We continue to maintain strong market leadership with our Quadro products. During the quarter, we shared our vision for physically-based rendering, which allows for the accurate simulation of real-life materials and their inaction with light. In the enterprise data center, NVIDIA's GRID graphics virtualization platform continues to hit key milestones. We now have over 250 enterprise customers with production deployments, up from just over 30 customers a year ago. In March, VMware, the virtualization market leader, shipped the latest versions of Horizon and vSphere with full support for NVIDIA GRID vGPU technology. More than 400 customers have signed on through the GRID Early Access program. HPC and cloud revenue was $79 million, up 57% year on year, with continued strength in the HPC market and among cloud service providers. Tesla products continue to benefit from widespread Internet, interest in deep learning. One indication of our traction was the success in March at the GPU Technology Conference, or GTC, where we drew a record 4,000 attendees. Two of the world's most renowned deep learning experts, Google's Jeff Dean and Baidu's Andrew Ng, delivered keynotes at the event. A growing number of companies are now using Tesla GPUs for deep learning, including the world's leading cloud service providers, like Baidu, Facebook, Flickr, Microsoft, and Twitter, as well as a broad range of startups. Another indication of our traction is the success of our library for developers, who implement deep neural networks. Since its March release, it has been downloaded by more than 5,000 deep learning developers. During the quarter, we also hit a milestone for CUDA, our parallel computing platform. It's now been downloaded 3 million times since its 2006 launch, with 1 million downloads in the past 18 months alone. Automotive revenue had a record quarter at $77 million, growing 121% year over year. Our design wins in digital clusters and infotainment continue to ramp over multiple automotive OEMs. At GTC, 25 global automakers and Tier 1 suppliers were represented, including developers and researchers from such companies as Audi, BMW, Delphi, and Elektrobit. Their enthusiasm reflects the interest, increasing importance of visual computing for automotive, and our position as a key technology provider for this market. We also announced the availability of our DRIVE PX deep learning development platform. It will provide researchers with the computing platform and software tools to develop algorithms for self-driving cars. We have started shipping DRIVE PX to developers around the world. The OEM and IP platform had revenue of $218 million, down 38% year over year. This reflected a combination of end of life for Tegra OEM designs as well as continued weakness in PC OEM sales. The weakness in PC OEMs has been broadly reported and attributed to foreign exchange rates and delays in purchasing leading up to the launch of Windows 10. Regarding IP, our case is progressing against Samsung and Qualcomm. Last month, NVIDIA received a favorable pre-trial claim construction ruling in the case. The case is set to be heard at the U.S. International Trade Commission beginning next month. Moving to gross margins, GAAP gross margins was a record 56.7%, above our outlook for the quarter and up 80 basis points from the previous quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins was 56.9%, also above our outlook and up 70 basis points sequentially. Our strong margins resulted from a richer product mix. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $477 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $425 million, in line with our outlook and inclusive of $16 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. GAAP net income was $134 million, down 2% from a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.24 was similar to a year ago. Now turning to some key balance sheet items; in Q1 our cash and marketable securities balance grew to $4.79 billion. During the first quarter, we paid $46 million in cash dividends and we repurchased 2.4 million shares. As a result, we returned an aggregate of $99 million to shareholders. Today, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.0975 per share. We have also announced our intent to increase our capital return to shareholders to $800 million in fiscal year 2016 from $600 million through cash dividends and share repurchases. Further, our Board of Directors has extended the previously authorized repurchase program through to December 2018 and authorized an additional $1.62 billion for an aggregate of $2 billion available for repurchase. We are committed to capital returns as an essential component in delivering shareholder value. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenue for the second quarter of 2016 to be $1.01 billion plus or minus 2%. In addition to seasonality, two factors informed our Q2 guidance. European currency weakness is affecting overall demand. Also, as widely reported by OEMs, a combination of seasonality and a lull ahead of Windows 10 launch are impacting the PC market. The overall dynamics of our business are great. Gaming is expanding and 4K, virtual reality, and Windows 10 will lift it further. GPU accelerated data centers are expanding, and deep learning is a new exciting application. And the market for car computers is expanding. We have an excellent position in each of these growth markets. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.7% and 56% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. This outlook is slightly below Q1 margins, reflecting our product mix. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $474 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $425 million, flat what last quarter. We announced earlier this week that we will begin to wind down our Icera modem operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We are open to the sale of the technology or operations. We estimate restructuring charges to our GAAP results in the range of $100 million to $125 million, primarily during fiscal 2016. These charges will consist of severance and other employee termination benefits, tax expense items, and other costs associated with the wind-down if we are unable to sell the modem operations. The Icera wind-down or sale is expected to benefit non-GAAP operating expenses in the second half of the year, and we will carefully invest in our growth initiatives of deep learning, self-driving cars, and gaming. We expect our fiscal year 2016 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat with fiscal year 2015, excluding litigation costs. Fiscal year 2016 litigation costs are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million as we defend our intellectual property. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 are expected to be 23% and 21% plus or minus 1%. The above GAAP outlook amounts exclude restructuring charges associated with the wind-down if the company is unable to sell the modem operations. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Colette, just on the outlook, and I appreciate all the color by segments. It sounded like that you're still seeing weakness in the OEM segment. I was wondering if that read was right into June. And then on gross margin, in terms of the mix, what are the moving parts there?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, it is true that we're still seeing a decline in our PC OEM and our Tegra OEM business, as we reported within our Q1 results. Again, we still see this as a business that we're going to still try our hardest for the overall growth, but what we see going into Q2 is a very soft market with the PC OEMs. And we do see probably a seasonal decline as we go into Q2. From a gross margin perspective, on the outlook and what we see, it's really driven from a mix perspective, as the decline in revenue from Q1 to Q2. And we still expect gaming to be great during that time and add value to our gross margins. But just because of the overall mix of what else is in the portfolio, we do expect it to come down to about 56%.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then just finally, on Icera, is there any meaningful \u2013 or not meaningful, but is this any revenue that would be material if you did shut it down to be cognizant of?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We wouldn't expect any material change to our revenue associated with the wind-down of Icera. That is correct.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Colette, my question is on OEM as well. AMD recently launched some new products in the OEM category. And my question is, if they are willing to take this business at a really low margin, would you still be interested in this space, or would you let it go? Is there a cutoff that below which you will not take this business?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we're always going to work with the OEMs on how they want to position our products. We have probably some of the best GPUs available to them. So if we're really talking about an OEM that's looking just for a low cost, they're probably not looking for us for that type of configuration. So it's not that we would turn away business, but we are going to be trying to make sure the value of what we have in terms of the GPU would be recognized by the OEMs.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. And as a follow-up, could you talk about GPU pricing that you saw in this quarter and any channel inventory update that you could provide because of these ForEx issues?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right now we have a pretty good understanding of our channel from what we can see, as we do have a good market position in terms of our cards across the world. So we watch it carefully. I would deem them right now to be in a healthy position as we exited the quarter. And there are, of course, the FX concerns around the world, not just in Europe. But right now, again, I think the channel is in a healthy position.\nSanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, Colette, can you give us some qualitative commentary on the outlook for automotive enterprise? I think you mentioned gaming was going to be up. But if you can, clarify that. Thanks.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Again, we didn't give specifics in our Q2 guidance on all of the different pieces of our market. What we want to discuss is our markets are extremely healthy; yes, gaming, automotive, high-performance computing, great leadership position, very healthy TAMs. How they'll grow specifically quarter to quarter, we'll see at the end of the quarter. But we've talked about we have a strong list of design wins for automotive. With that strong list of design wins, we can expect our revenue to grow in that area. If it grows specifically between Q1 and Q2, we'll have to see, based on when the manufacturers want to pull the inventory for their lines. So that's not necessarily fully in our control. But long term, this is a growth opportunity for us, as we outlined our growth platforms. On the enterprise side, again, it's really tough to say where the currency will take us within the second quarter. We can all hope that it will improve. But right now, we're just going to have to see at the end of the quarter how it actually comes out in enterprise.\nHans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham. Please go ahead.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co.: Yes, thanks. If you could just, Colette, maybe remind us how much of your sales is denominated in euro.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: To remind you, as we talk about in our SEC filings, that most of our revenue is actually billed in USD. That doesn't mean we don't have the impact from FX rates, though, on our overall business. What it just means is any part of the channel, any part of the customer buying process has to think about the prices as they sit in their regions in terms of where they are. So really, we don't have a direct translation impact in terms of our overall business, and every part of the world is going to react differently based on the FX positions.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co.: Right. If we assume that there's some growth in Tegra sequentially in the June quarter and the royalty stays the same as it always does, at least for the time being, it would basically imply that the GPU business, including workstation, is going to be down something like 16% sequentially. And so I just wanted to try to understand. That's a pretty big drop-off, if that math is correct.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Again, we're probably just going to have to see at the end of the quarter. I want us to make sure we really start back with the health of many of these different markets, particularly gaming. We still expect gaming from a year-over-year perspective to definitely grow. How fast it will grow, we'll have to see at the end of Q2. But keep in mind, there is generally a sequential seasonal decline as we move into our Q2 that we're going to see. So we don't have a specific number at this time in terms of our overall GPU business. We have got the weakness of the currencies right now that we have to consider in that Q2 quarter and what we see in terms of low purchasing on the overall PC market generally. So I think that is what is incorporated in our guidance rather than very specific to the GPU or the Tegra business.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co.: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, this is Ji Yoo calling in for Ross Seymore. Can you discuss any interest that you've seen for the Icera business for the technology in IP?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm sorry. What was the question?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The question was regarding the interest that we may have in the Icera business from outside.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: We have just started that process, so we don't have much to report at this time.\nJiHyung Yoo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, got it, and thank you for giving the update on the increased return to shareholders. Can you give us an update on the level of cash onshore, and how does that factor into if there's any offshore cash that needs to be repatriated?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Again, we're extremely comfortable with our decision to raise the capital return program to $800 million, and after much thought and consideration in terms of looking at both our onshore and our offshore cash and overall cash flow that we expect for the rest of the year. So we are comfortable with that position. And again, our total cash is about the same as where we ended at fiscal year 2015, a little bit up in Q1. And so we're going to return an additional portion of that to shareholders at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you for taking the question. The first one is just a clarification. Colette, on the expense guidance for the year, it's clear what you're expecting legal to be, that $70 million to $90 million. What was it in fiscal 2015? And when we look at the flat year-on-year expense ex-legal, is it ex-legal both years or just ex-legal in fiscal 2016?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, Craig. When you look at the timing of when we initiated our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm, it was relatively at the latter or the end of fiscal year 2015. So there's not a material amount in fiscal year 2015 associated with the legal expenses. So the way that you can look at it is we've called out a potential range of what we see for fiscal year 2016 to help you going forward. And so you should just use the baseline of fiscal year 2015 as a total for the rest of the OpEx to be flat.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then the follow-up is either to you or Jen-Hsun. As you see more of the GRID trials move to production, and the year-on-year increase of 8x is pretty impressive, up to 250 customers, what's that mean for revenue? What's the revenue opportunity doing as you go from a trial to a production situation?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Surely every production is a little bit different because every company is different size. But if you look at just the revenues year over year, the proportion is about the same as the number that goes to production, so it's grown. It has also grown proportionally about the same.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: And do you think that's fair as a way to think about what the future prospects will be, Jen-Hsun, or is there something different about the way new trials are going that would cause that to deviate, either higher or lower?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: My hope is that it actually increases. And the reason for that is because over time, not only will we get new customers into production, but existing customers will deploy more broadly. And so my expectation is that we should get growth on both sides of it. And once an IT department gets this, it's a network-based virtualization technology. And so of course, it's just enormously helpful that VMware has now integrated vGPU GRID into both Horizon as well as vSphere. And so from end to end, we now have GRID certified in large corporations. VMware is certified. Citrix is certified. Both of their sales force, the sales force of the OEMs are all aligned with us, and we're working on engaging customers all over the world. And so the first thing that they do, of course, is to test all of their applications. And large companies have a lot of different applications in the works. It could be SOLIDWORKS, it could be Autodesk, AutoCAD. It could be Adobe Photoshop or Premiere or After Effects. It could be all kinds of applications that require 3D graphics acceleration. And so once they certify that, in fact, qualify that in fact, the applications all are perfectly compatible, which we largely expect them to be, then they start deploying them over the network. And some networks need to be shored up because this is about virtualizing the whole PC, and so it's being streamed over the corporate network. So some of the networks need to be shored up. And then, of course, making sure that all of the end users are satisfied with the experiences that they have, which largely they've been more than delighted because, as you could imagine, having a GPU accelerated virtualization platform has got to be pretty exciting. And so far, we've seen that the trials have gone over nicely. And then as more people use it, the more people will want to enjoy it, and we hope that not only will we increase the number of customers but the number of seats within each customer over time.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the questions.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, I think there is some skepticism that PC gaming \u2013 so this is a longer term question \u2013 that there is some skepticism that PC gaming is not really a growth market and that all the growth that you guys are seeing is really because of short-term product cycle or share gains against AMD. So my question is, what tangible data points can you point us to that says that the number of gamers is actually increasing and that this is really a growth market for NVIDIA?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, let's see. How I do I answer that? I think you're getting a lot of anecdotal evidence from multiple directions that suggests that PC gaming is growing. First of all, eSports. You know that eSports is largely PC gaming. And eSports has become so large now that it's even highlighted on ESPN2 \u2013 ESPN. You know that the number of stadiums that have sold out as a result of eSport tournaments is growing over time. So there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that video games is growing. I think it's also pretty clear that almost every new human is a gamer. The previous generation before me, very few are gamers. My generation, I would say probably is 25% gamers. My kids' generation is probably 75% gamers, and the generation after that's got to be 100% gamers. And so games is no longer a niche. Game is really a pop culture now, and we expect that gaming to continue to expand. And then the last thing is, the last reason why I would say we'll get multiple uplifts in gaming, it has to do with the new mediums that are coming out. 4K displays are becoming quite commoditized and quite affordable, and it has four times as many pixels to process. And so although the imagery is much richer, you need a much more powerful GPU to drive it. We're looking forward to VR. VR is launching later this year, and VR is going to be launching on multiple platforms. And in order to enjoy great VR, you need 90 frames per second in stereo and two eyes. And so unless you have something along the lines of a GTX 980 or a TITAN at the moment, it's hard to enjoy great VR. And anybody who has tried VR is generally blown away by it, and that explains the enthusiasm in the industry. So whether it's eSports or the fact that just more people are playing games that are growing up and are familiar with the format, and the new mediums that are coming out, 4K and VR. And of course, Windows 10 in time is going to really help. Windows 10 is a great operating system and has DX12. And DX12 is a fantastic new API. It's been a while since we've had a new 3D API. So we're excited about DX12. So there are a lot of things going in gaming, and that explains the reason why it just continues to grow.\nVivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Got it, very helpful. And as my follow-up. I think I understand the slowdown near term. How should we think about the back half conceptually? How much of the slowdown right now is because of temporary factors, and how much can we expect to recover in the back half? Should it be normal seasonality in the back half? I know it's a little early to give guidance. But just conceptually, how are you thinking about the back half of the year? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate that. We give guidance once a quarter, one quarter ahead. But if you look at the overall market, we expect seasonality. But more importantly, our position in the growth markets are really great. First of all, gaming is growing, as we previously discussed. The second half of this year, you're going to see multiple growth drivers. 4K monitor pricing is really coming down. VR is launching in the second half. And Windows 10 with DirectX 12 is launching in the second half, not to mention all the great games coming out. So I think that that's a growth driver. We continue to see that our GPU business for accelerated data centers continues to grow. It grew more than 50% year over year. We expect it to continue to grow with the enthusiasm around this new application called deep learning. We're seeing artificial intelligence work in every single country by every single computer company and every single large application developer. The ability to predict the future for better applications and smarter applications is pretty unbounded. And lastly, we had a record quarter with our automotive business. We're growing now faster than doubling. And computing in cars, as you can imagine, is going to continue to expand. So these growth drivers I think are pretty fundamental to the market, and we have great positions in all three of them.\nVivek Arya - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you, two questions, one a real quick one. Colette, in the charges that you laid out from Icera, how much is going to be cash and non-cash?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks for the question. We're still in the super, super early stages of winding down this business and the process associated with it. So we gave a top-level range in terms of looking at what is on the balance sheet and the employment side. So we'll probably get into that a little bit more in the end of Q2. The way you should look at it is there's a pretty good split or a pretty good mix at this point, so it's not all cash. There is a significant amount of it that is non-cash. But we won't know the details of that until we end Q2.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, thank you, and then a question for you, Jen-Hsun. Core processors, GPGPU versus, if the rumors are true, Intel is offering an astronomical valuation for what is a $1 billion market that Altera has claimed for FPGA coprocessor. So the question for you is just help \u2013 just remind us. Where does GPGPU fit into that? And how should we think about the market? Intel's DCG revenues are $14 billion-odd, and the Tesla trajectory from when you initially started the product off a few years ago was slow to start but has picked up. So five years out, how should we be thinking about the addressable market? And just help us \u2013 just remind us. Where does the GPGPU fit in? And how should we think about coprocessors from FPGA? And where are the specific needs workloads-wise or whatever? However you can help us, enlighten us would be great, Jen-Hsun. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. First of all, CUDA, the GPGPU technology that we invented, is growing more than 50% per year. The applications for CUDA ranges from deep learning to image processing, to natural language processing, to weather simulations, fluid dynamic simulations, molecular dynamic simulations, Quantum chemistry simulations, astrophysics simulations \u2013 gosh, ray tracing. The number of applications that we can spew off is pretty endless. And that's one of the reasons why nearly every single OEM in the world today has GPU accelerated servers. There's got to be some 200 different SKUs of GPU accelerated servers being offered by OEMs around the world. I don't think one of them offer an FPGA server yet, and so that's one indication. The number of applications, the number of OEMs, the number of industries that we now serve with GPGPU, with Tesla, if you will, is really quite large. And it explains why this segment, this market, this business for us is growing over 50% per year, and it's now off of a relatively large base. So that I think is the way to think about, if you will, the evidence of success. Now the reason for that, of course, is that CUDA is a processor architecture. It's an instruction set architecture. It's completely software programmable. It has the support of tools and profilers and all kinds of middleware from around the industries. So it's a general purpose parallel computing architecture, and it's completely reprogrammable. Whereas an FPGA is like a reconfigurable ASIC, which means the person who designs it, the person who reprograms it, if you will, reconfigures it has to know how to design a chip. And there aren't that many people in the world who knows how to design chips. There's got to be 1,000 times more software programmers than there are the number of chip designers. And so one is reprogrammable, general purpose programmable. The other one is reconfigurable, if you will, which explains the general purpose nature of Tesla. It explains the vast number of applications of it. It's taken a long time. It takes a long time to create a new computing architecture. And in fact, aside from Tesla, aside from CUDA, I actually don't know of another new type of instruction set that has come to the world. It's been a long time. The world has had DSPs now for a long time; it's got CPUs for a long time. Aside from GPGPU, I don't think another general purpose programmable architecture has emerged into the world in a very long time. And the niche that we discovered was parallel processing. We believe there are a lot of problems in the world, a lot of applications in the world where you could process it massively in parallel. And that explains the reason why you could create a supercomputer like the one at Oak Ridge that has 36 million \u2013 38 million CUDA processor cores all processing in parallel, 38 million cores all processing in parallel. And now the DOE has tasked us and IBM to partner together to build supercomputers that are going to be 100 times that. And so the parallel computing capability and the scalability of CUDA that we invented is really quite phenomenal and it explains the reason for its success. I appreciate your question.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks Jen-Hsun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. In your recent filings, you disclosed that you're procuring wafers from Samsung. Can you offer some color on what products you're actually building at Samsung. And maybe, Colette, if you can, help us understand maybe the gross margin impact to a multi-source foundry strategy.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Doug. First of all, we're constantly evaluating foundry suppliers. We largely purchase from TSMC. The vast majority of our wafers we buy from TSMC. And we're in 20-nanometer now. We're expecting to ramp 16-nanometer. And so we're deeply engaged with TSMC for many, many nodes to come, including 10-nanometer. But we're always looking at new foundry suppliers, and competition keeps everybody sharp. But for all intents and purposes, TSMC is our primary partner.\nDouglas Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. If I could for my follow-up, when I look at your legal expenses, is there any return on investment that we should look at from that level of spending? Is there some way that we can use that to derive maybe what it is that you're seeking in terms of IP income as a result of these lawsuits?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I appreciate that question. We wouldn't invest $70 million to $90 million to defend our patents unless we expect a substantial return on that investment. We don't go into litigation lightly. And in fact, quite frankly, I don't recall the last time that we asserted against somebody. And so I think this is something we took with a great deal of consideration. At the highest level, the way to think about it is this. We've invented more in modern computer graphics and modern visual computing than just about any company, and in fact all the companies combined. We invented GPU that everybody \u2013 just about everybody in mobile today, large or small in volume, are utilizing in some way. We invented a programmable shader. And we invented, and the question that was just asked of me that I appreciated was we invented GPGPUs. And these technologies are really fundamental to modern computer companies. And whether it's mobile, car computers, supercomputers, you name it, our technology is pretty vital to it. And so it's necessary for us and for all of our shareholders that we defend this, from all of our employees that come here to do their life's work so that they invent all of this stuff, to the shareholders that have entrusted us to make these investments. We have to go and make sure that we get the appropriate return on investment. You also know that today's technology industry, the supply chain is much more complicated, if you will, than it used to be. And at the core, NVIDIA is an IP company. We don't make steel. We don't make concrete, and we don't really even make wafers. We're an IP company at our core. And so we're comfortable making our innovations and our work products available, whether it's in a service or a GPU or an add-in card or even in IP form. So our expectation is that, one, we have to defend it. Two, the return on that investment should be very, very high because the exposure of the inventions that we've made in the industries that I mentioned just a moment ago are quite large.\nDouglas Freedman - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you for taking my questions.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, I'm wondering if you can share any insights into both what's happening real time and what might be happening in the back half of the year in terms of the Chrome systems, the Android systems, where you're pairing yourself with ARM-based computing and your GPU capabilities, and any thoughts on if we are moving towards the day when you guys get yourself free from the constraints of the x86 monopoly. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think at the highest level, a cloud-connected computer, whether it's an Android device or a Chrome device, is going to become more and more popular simply because we're connected more often than not. And the power of cloud computing is pretty extraordinary. It's like everybody gets a super computer, and more and more of our GPUs are now going into the cloud data centers. And so my expectation is that long term we likely will see more and more of these types of thin, delightfully small, and long battery life computers. And so I think that that trend is inevitable. However, x86 is really still quite important in so many industries, whether it's in high-performance computing. The energy efficiency of Intel CPUs in a data center is pretty, pretty hard to overcome. They've done an incredibly good job. The workstation industry, CATIA, Autodesk's applications, Adobe applications, so many of these applications that large companies rely on, that legacy is 35 years old. And it explains also the reason why our Quadro business is so sticky and our position there so strong, the legacy is quite strong and people rely on that platform to run their business. And so my expectation is that x86 and Intel architecture has its place in the world. And then ARM is also going to be, of course, has the opportunity to bring computing to a large number of people, especially smaller devices that are connected to the cloud. So you're talking to somebody who believes in computing, and you're talking to somebody who believes that the future of computing has really just started. And so my sense is that there's a lot of great, great expansion to be done yet.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: So if I'm hearing you right, and you talked about this a little bit earlier when you talked about PC gaming. But if I'm thinking about gaming, and I'm thinking out the next year or two, for you to not be talking in a PC sense, it's really going to be a cloud-driven model. You don't see any Android-based systems in the works that can do any heavy, big iron local client-side gaming. Is that fair to say?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Look, I think PC gaming is here to stay, and it's here to stay because there are some genres of games that are just better with a keyboard and mouse. And you can play your game in your bedroom and not have to share with anybody in the living room. On the other hand, there's 1 billion people who have not had the benefit of enjoying the type of AAA games that are largely, largely in game consoles, which is a little bit like a cable box, if you will, a dedicated thing that people buy to now be able to enjoy it broadly in living rooms all over the world. So I think there are still ways to expand the reach of gaming, and that's why we're building SHIELD and that's why we're building GRID. We believe that long term, video games, like video, like movies, will become democratized. And it would be well virtualized and put into the cloud like Netflix and for us to be able to enjoy it all over the world. And so I believe that, and we've got to go lay the foundation necessary to go bring that to the world. I'm pretty excited about some of the work that we're going to reveal this year, and I think we just have to push on all of those vectors. I think all of those vectors are real. PC gaming is going to keep growing. Cloud gaming will come. And Android gaming on TVs will disrupt the market. I believe in all three things simultaneously.\nAlex D. Gauna - JMP Securities LLC: Got you, all right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of GPU products you might have in the pipeline that might come out the next year or two, and what your plans are for manufacturing technology?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, David. I can't wait to tell you about the products that we have in the pipeline. There are more engineers at NVIDIA building the future of GPUs than just about anywhere else in the world. We're singularly focused on visual computing, as you guys know. And we have found over the years to be able to focus on just one thing, which is visual computing, and be able to leverage that one thing across PC, cloud, and mobile, and be able to address four very, very large markets with that one thing, gaming, enterprise, cloud, and automotive. We can do this one thing and now be able to enjoy all and deliver the capabilities to the market in all three major computing platforms, and gain four vertical markets that are quite frankly very exciting. So I can't wait to tell you all about it, David. You're just going to have to wait just a little longer.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great, one other then. With the wind-down of Icera, do you have many products that require modem technology? Will you need to pay significant license fees in the future to use third-party IP, or are your modem needs fairly small at this point?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: We're going to use i500, which has been qualified in largely the Western world, for the foreseeable future, for the next couple years. When the world moves to 5G, we hope that there are going to be, and our assessment is that there will be, multiple suppliers in the marketplace. And we'll partner with them if it's necessary. But our primary focus is going to be focusing on visual computing products.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, as you look at PC gaming, can you talk through what normal seasonality looks like in July, and then also in terms of what you saw in this past quarter in terms of FX risk? And I guess there, thinking through what the implications were in terms of pricing, any downward mix shift given in particular what we saw in FX and euro and ruble?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: So I appreciate that question. I think if you back off and look at the larger dynamic of gaming, the larger dynamic of PC gaming, the primary driver of PC gaming comes from two areas. One is amazing new games. That's number one. Number two is brand new technologies, whether it's a brand new GPU, amazing new display technology, and 4K I would characterize as amazing new display technology, and then new technologies like VR. So new technologies are the reasons why people come to upgrade. And so new games that are just amazing and they need new GPUs, or just amazing new GPUs that cause the install base to upgrade. And so those are the two primary reasons. However, this year starting in Q1, and surely we're experiencing some of it in Q2 as well, is the currency disruption that's been broadly described. That I think has a pretty significant impact because what it does is just makes all the GPUs more unaffordable, and so everything just got more expensive in Europe. But that's something that hopefully will pass, and I'm looking forward to what happens in the second half. VR is coming, and you know how excited everybody is about VR. There's good reason for that. From John Carmack and Tim Sweeney and the leaders of the gaming industry, we all now recognize that VR is going to be the future of gaming, although we're going to continue to use monitors for many types of games and many genres of games and we'll play it on TV and such. But there will be a very large genre of games based on VR. And there's no question about that now. And so I'm excited about the rollout of VR across the industry in the second half. And of course, you just can't not get excited about DX12 and Windows 10. I think it's going to be a pretty big deal. So I think the second half should be exciting, and we're looking forward to it.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities: Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, Colette, on the OpEx side, when you look at the wind-down of Icera, what is the quarterly OpEx savings, and when should you get the full benefit of that?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So we are in the early stages of Icera. Again, we're going to hopefully look for a buyer of it first. On the quarterly OpEx, the amount of that OpEx declining, we look for the opportunities in our growth areas for investment in the second half of the year. So essentially, we'll be about where we are right now in the second half of the year after we wind down the Icera.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA. Please go ahead.\nSrini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I guess the currency issue is understandable. I'm just curious as to what sort of trends you're seeing in the U.S. and China, where I think currency is less of an issue, and also obviously those are two of your biggest markets.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: First of all, Europe is a not insignificant market for PC gaming, whether it's Russia, which is a very large market for PC gaming. You'll be surprised how large it is; and Germany, very large markets for PC gaming. But that notwithstanding, the U.S. market and \u2013 the China market, as you know, also was a little bit slow this last several months. Their economy is a little bit slower. But I think none of that is very significant compared to the FX implications. But we're seeing robust activity in the channel now and, as you know, the exchange rate is improving. And so I'm hopeful that business will return to normal relatively soon. We'll see how it goes.\nSrini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC: Great. And then, Colette, just to follow up on the OpEx, you said I guess, $60 million to $70 million or $80 million for the legal. Do you expect any seasonality? I guess what I'm asking is as we exit this fiscal year, do you expect the run rate on a quarterly base to decline? Thank you.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, thanks for the question. We really wanted just to provide the transparency on how important this litigation is to us and what we're doing to support that with the expenses and the range. We don't have a crystal ball of how this will go. So we know about what we're approximating for the full year in there. We indicated in Q1 we spent about $16 million, but we'll take it day by day at this point. It's a very, very important set of cases for us, and we'll keep you updated as it goes throughout the year.\nSrini R. Pajjuri - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJames Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you so much for taking the question. At AMD's Analyst Day yesterday, they talked a lot about new technology they were going to introduce in spaces where you've been pretty dominant from a market share and technology standpoint over the last couple years, taking a lot of share from them. I'm not sure if you've had a chance to look at any of the things that they said or if you have any thoughts that you could share with us on that.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: They've been a strong competitor for as long as I can remember, and they remain a strong competitor. It's just that our strategy is very different now. We used to be much more of a component supplier, competing directly with other component suppliers. But increasingly, we're really a differentiated platform supplier. And so you find that the software investments that we've made over the years really, really increasingly define our product. If you think about Tesla, the amount of software that's stacked on top of Tesla from all the tools that we created, the middleware, the libraries, the programming models, the robustness of all of it, the integration with all the industry's software products and everybody else's software that's built on top of Tesla is pretty daunting. And so it's hardly just a GPU anymore. GRID is all about software, otherwise it's just another one of our GPUs. And so GRID is largely about software, virtualization software, concurrency software, the ability to deal with very, very low latency streaming, the integration with all the tools in the world and all the other platforms in the world. So I think when we think about our products and our platforms, it's really about the differentiated value that we've built on top of our GPUs, number one; and number two, I think the deep integration with the large ecosystems around the world, to the point where other companies' capabilities are really glommed onto this platform, making this platform more valuable to customers. And so that's really what's changed about our company's strategy and why increasingly we look very different than other component suppliers.\nJames Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful, thank you. For my follow-up, if I look back to the transcript on the last call, there was a view expressed that some of the issues that were impacting the other companies' PC OEMs business, maybe NVIDIA was a little bit more insulated from that. Is the view that the weakness in the PC space has broadened out a little bit, and that's why maybe we're seeing some of the follow-on effect into your business?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think first of all, we're one of the few companies that didn't miss the last quarter, and Q1 was relatively fine for us. What we said was that we're going to let them \u2013 what is broadly impacting the rest of the industry inform us about Q2. And we think that when it comes down to enterprise, that's one of the factors. Enterprise does affect us. When enterprise slows down because of FX issues or delays in purchase because of Windows 10, workstations is part of enterprise, servers that they buy is part of enterprise, and so it affects us there. We still have a piece of our business that even though it's a rather small percentage of our business at this point, it's still non-zero. Our PC OEM business is affected by what's happening around the world. And so I would say that yes, our Q2 is informed by all of those factors. But I would say that also our core business is really doing well. Gaming is robust, and I expect gaming to continue to grow. The work that we're doing in accelerated data centers, it grew 50% year over year, and my expectation is that it's going to be a strong business for us going forward. And the success that we're seeing in automotive and the expansion of car computers has allowed us to double our business there. So our core businesses are growing very nicely, and largely independent of what is being experienced in PC OEMs globally.\nJames Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, thanks a lot, James.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital. Please go ahead.\nJoseph A. Gallo - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. This is Joe on for Chris. Just to follow up with your competitors and what they've been saying, it looks like they're going to 14-nanometer FinFET next year. I was just wondering how you view this change. Do you expect anything in the industry to change because of this? And then when might you guys get back to process leadership?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'm not sure that we've ever had process leadership. We go to a new process when we're ready to go to a new process. And as you know, we could wring out new architectural efficiencies in exactly the same process technology for several generations with 28-nanometer. The difference between Kepler and Maxwell is pretty amazing. To be able to deliver twice the energy efficiency in one generation using exactly the same process is pretty exciting. And so I think there are many ways to skin the cat, and we surely expect and we surely expect to go and look forward to going to next-generation nodes. But the GPU is a piece of the puzzle. The algorithms we put into the GPUs is a very important piece of puzzle. The software on top of it is a piece of puzzle and the system design is a piece of the puzzle. There are just so many ways for us to deliver energy efficiency and performance. I wouldn't get too obsessed about the process technology all by itself.\nJoseph A. Gallo - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, I was just hoping you guys could break out what percent notebook represents within a PC GPU.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Within PC, our overall GPU business, and how big is notebook?\nJoseph A. Gallo - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yes.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We don't give out that. I don't have it actually in front of me right here on this side, but we are seeing definitely a good amount of growth in terms of our notebook for gaming, and we still have a very strong position as well in just general PC notebooks. So they're both about equal in size in terms of our total. It's a percentage of our PC number.\nJoseph A. Gallo - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Mr. Arnab Chanda, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer: This is Jen-Hsun. First of all, I want to thank all of you for tuning in today. We're really pleased with the quarter. Our businesses are performing well. Looking beyond the broad industry headwinds of Q2, we have great growth drivers in our core platforms, gaming, HPC cloud, enterprise, and auto. And in each market segment, as we've discussed, our position is differentiated and strong. We're excited that visual computing is more important than ever, and I look forward to talking to you guys next time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}], "2018": [{"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2017, "date": "2017-02-09 22:47:30", "content": "Executives: Arnab K.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Arnab. We had a stellar Q4 and fiscal 2017 with records in all of our financial metrics; revenue, gross margin, operating margins and EPS. Growth was driven primarily by Datacenter tripling with a rapid adoption of AI worldwide. Quarterly revenue reached $2.17 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, and up 8% sequentially, and above our outlook of $2.1 billion. Fiscal 2017 revenue was just over $6.9 billion, up 38% and nearly $2 billion more than fiscal 2016. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year was broad based with record revenue in each of our four platforms, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Our full year performance demonstrates the success of our GPU platform-based business model. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 57% to $1.85 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue was up 64% to $257 million. Let's start with our Gaming platform. Q4 Gaming revenue was a record $1.35 billion, rising 66% year-on-year and up 8% from Q3. Gamers continued to upgrade to our new Pascal-based GPUs. Adding to our gaming lineup we launched GTX 1050 class GPUs for notebooks, bringing eSports and VR capabilities to mobile at great value. The GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti were featured in more than 30 new models launched at last month's Consumer Electronics Show. To enhance the gaming experience, we announced G-SYNC HDR, a technology that enables displays which are brighter and more vibrant than any other gaming monitor. Our partners have launched more than 60 G-SYNC-capable monitors and laptops, enabling smooth play without screen tear artifact. eSports too continues to attract new gamers. Major tournaments with multi-million dollar purses are drawing enormous audiences. This last quarter, Dota 2 held its first major tournament of the season in Boston. Tickets sold out in minutes. The prize pool reached $3 million, and millions of gamers watched online. Moving to Professional Visualization, Quadro revenue grew 11% from a year ago to a record $225 million, driven by demand for high-end, real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We recently launched a family of Pascal-based GPUs designed for mobile workstations which leading OEMs are embracing. Earlier this week, we introduced Quadro GP100, which creates a new supercomputing workstation. This new type of workstation enables engineers, designers and artists to take advantage of new technologies of photorealism, fluid simulation and deep learning. Next, Datacenter; revenue more than tripled from a year ago, and was up 23% sequentially to $296 million. Growth was driven by AI, cloud service providers deploying GPU instances, High Performance Computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX AI supercomputing appliance. AI is transforming industries worldwide. The first adopters were hyperscale companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which use deep learning to provide billions to customers with AI services that utilizes image recognition and voice processing. The next area of growth will occur as enterprise in such fields as health care, retail, transportation and finance embrace deep learning on GPUs. At November's SC 2016 Supercomputing Conference, Microsoft announced that its GPU-accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is available both in Azure cloud and on premises with our DGX-1 AI supercomputer. In a series of related announcements at SG 2016, we described our plans to join the Cancer Moonshot project in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Department of Energy and several national labs, to help build predictive models and guide treatment under this project. We are collaborating on a new AI framework called, CANDLE, the Cancer Distributed Learning Environment. And to support this work, we unveiled our new own supercomputer, the NVIDIA DGX SATURNV, which joins together 124 DGX-1 systems. It's currently the world's 28th fastest supercomputer, and the number one system in energy efficiency. Our GRID, graphics, virtualization business doubled year-on-year, driven by strong growth in the education, automotive, and energy sectors. We are excited to be hosting our eighth annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley from May 8 to May 11. This will be the year's most important event for AI and accelerated computing. And we expect it to be our largest GTC yet, attended by thousands of application developers, scientists and academics, as well as entrepreneurs and corporate executives. Finally, in Automotive, revenue grew to a record $128 million, up 38% year-over-year. At Jen-Hsun's CES opening keynote, we demonstrated our leadership position in self-driving vehicles. With a growing list of industry players adopting our AI car platform, we also showcased AI co-pilot, a technology that will recognize a driver and their preferences, monitor their alertness, understand natural spoken language, and provide alerts in dangerous situations. One of the highlights at CES was the demonstration of our own autonomous car, dubbed BB8. More than 500 passengers took rides in the back seat without a driver behind the wheel. We announced a number of new partnerships at the show. Among them were collaborations with Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier and ZF, Europe's leading supplier for the truck industry, both centered on developing AI car computers with DRIVE PX 2 technology. We also announced that we're working on cloud-to-car mapping collaboration with HERE, focused on the U.S. and Europe, and ZENRIN, focused on Japan. These complement partnerships announced in Q3 with Europe's TomTom and China's Baidu. Our mapping partnerships spanned all geographies. Jen-Hsun was joined on the CES stage by Audi of America's President, Scott Keogh. They announced the extension of our decade-long partnership to deliver cars with Level 4 autonomy starting in 2020, powered by DRIVE PX technology. Audi will deliver Level 3 autonomy in its A8 luxury sedan later this year through its zFAS system powered by NVIDIA. We also shared news at CES of our partnership with Mercedes-Benz to collaborate on a car that will be available by year's end. During the quarter, Tesla began delivering a new autopilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform in every new Model S and Model X, to be followed by the Model 3. Tesla's cars will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. In addition, Volvo started turning over the keys to initial customers of its Drive Me program. Its XC90 SUVs equipped with DRIVE PX 2 are capable of fully autonomous operation on designated roads in Volvo's hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden. With NVIDIAs powering the market's only self-driving cars and partnerships with leading automakers, Tier 1 suppliers, and mapping companies, we feel very confident in our position as the transportation industry moves to autonomous vehicles. Next, our OEM and IP business was $176 million, down 11% year-on-year. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement for Q4. Gross margins were at record levels with GAAP gross margins at 60%, and non-GAAP at 60.2%. These reflect the success of our platform approach, as well as strong demand for GeForce gaming GPUs and deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $570 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $498 million, up 12% from a year earlier, reflecting head count-related costs for our AI growth initiatives, as well as investments in sales and marketing. We are investing into huge market opportunities, AI, self-driving cars, cloud computing and gaming. Thus, we expect our operating expense growth rate to be in the high teens over the next several quarters. GAAP operating income was $733 million, and non-GAAP operating income was $809 million, both more than doubled from a year earlier. Our GAAP tax rate was 10%, and our non-GAAP was 13%. These rates were lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax. GAAP EPS was $0.99. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13. In fiscal year 2017, we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in line with our intention. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. At the mid-point, this represents 46% growth over the prior year. We expect Datacenter to grow sequentially. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.5% and 59.7%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. This guidance assumes that our licensing agreement with Intel ends at March and does not renew. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $603 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $520 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $20 million, including additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $4 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. With that, I'm going to turn it back for the operator so we can open up for questions. Please limit your questions to just one. Operator, let's start with the questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J., your line is open.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Can you hear me? Yeah, my apologies. Stuck on a plane here. Great, great, great results. I guess, was hoping to get a little more color on the Datacenter side. Now, that we've completed a full fiscal year 2017, would love to get some clarity on the different moving parts and contributions there. And then I guess, looking into 2018 how you see the growth unfolding thereafter? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, C.J. first of all, thanks a lot. Well, the single biggest mover would have to be Datacenter. I mean, when you look back on last year and we look forward, there's a lot of reasons why Datacenter business overall grew 3x, grew by a factor of three. And so I would expect that to happen, to continue. There's several elements of our Datacenter business. There's the high performance computing part. There's the AI part. There's GRID, which is graphics virtualization. There's cloud computing, which is providing our GPU platform up in the cloud for startups and enterprises and all kinds of external customers to be able to access in the cloud, as well as a brand new AI supercomputing appliance that we created last year for anybody who would like to engage deep learning and AI, but don't have the skills or don't have the resources or don't have the desire to build their own high performance computing cluster. And so we integrated all of that with all of the complicated software stacks into an appliance that we maintain over the cloud. We call that DGX-1. And so these pieces, AI, high performance computing, cloud computing, GRID and DGX all in contribution, contributed to our growth in Datacenter quite substantially. And so my sense is that, that as we look forward to next year, we're going to continue to see that major trend. Of course, gaming was a very large and important factor. And my expectation is that gaming is going to continue to do that. And then longer-term, longer-term our position in self-driving cars, I think, is becoming more and more clear to people over time. And I expect that self-driving cars will be available on the road starting this year with early movers, and no later than 2020 for Level 4 by the majors, and you might even see some of them pull into 2019. And so those are some of the things that we're looking forward to.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. I actually had one question for Jen-Hsun, and one sort of clarification for Colette. So Jen-Hsun, where are we in the gaming cycle? It's been very strong the last few years. What proportion of your base do you think has upgraded to Pascal, and where does that usually peak before you launch your next-generation products? And then for Colette, just inventory dollars in days picked up. If you could give us some comment on that. And then just on OpEx productivity, you did a very good job last year, but this time you're saying OpEx will go up mid-teen. Do you still think there is operating leverage in the model? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Well, let's say we typically assume that we have an installed base of a couple of 100 million GeForce gamers, and we've upgraded about two quarters of them, as in two operating quarters out of four years. It takes about three to four years to upgrade the entire installed base. And we started ramping Pascal, as you know, a few quarters ago. And our data would suggest that the upgrade cycle is going well, and we have plenty to go.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Vivek. On your question on inventory, as you know, in many of our businesses, we are still carrying a significant architecture, and a broad list of different products for those architectures across. We feel comfortable with our level of inventory as we look forward into fiscal year 2018 and our sales going forward. Your second question was regarding OpEx and comparing it to where we finished in 2017 and moving into fiscal year 2018. We do have some great opportunities, large businesses, for us to go capture the overall TAMs for, and we are going to be continuing to invest in the Datacenter, specifically in AI, self-driving cars, as well as gaming. And so rather than a focus on what the specific operating margin is, we're going to focus primarily just on growing the overall TAM, and capturing that TAM on the top line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Question back on the Datacenter, the growth was impressive. And I'm wondering, you mentioned that the hyperscale players really have embraced the products first, and I'm wondering if you could share with us to the extent that you think that they're embracing it for their own use, or to the extent that they're deploying it for services such as machine learning as a service and enterprises, are really kind of tapping into this also through the hyperscale guys. And I'm wondering, if you could help, you mentioned that the enterprise is where you expect to see embracing the technology next and healthcare, retail, transport, finance, and I'm wondering if you could share with us how you feel about that visibility, where you're getting that visibility from. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Well, on hyperscale, you're absolutely right, that there's internal, what we call, internal use for deep learning, and then there's the hosting GPU in the cloud for external high-performance computing use, which includes deep learning. Inside the hyperscalers, the early adopters are moving obviously very, very fast. But everybody has to follow. Everybody has to follow. Deep learning has proven to be too effective, and you guys, everybody knows now that every hyperscaler in the world is investing very heavily in deep learning. And so my expectation is that, over the next coming years, deep learning and AI will become the essential tool by which they do their computing. Now, when they host it in the cloud, people out in the cloud use it for a variety of applications, and one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GPU is such a great platform is because of its broad utility. We've been working on GPU computing now for coming up on 12 years, and industry-after-industry, our GPU computing architecture has been embraced for high-performance computing, for data processing, for deep learning and such. And so when somebody hosts it up in the cloud, for example, Amazon putting our GPUs up in the cloud, that instance has the ability to do molecular dynamics, to deep learning training, to deep learning inferencing. Companies could use it for offloading their computation to start-ups being able to build their company and build their application, and then host it for hundreds of millions of people to use. And so I think the hyperscalers are going to continue to adopt GPU both for internal consumption, and cloud hosting for some time to come. And we're just in the beginning of that cycle, and that's one of the reasons why we have quite a fair amount of enthusiasm around the growth here. You mentioned Enterprise, and enterprise, it has all woken to the power of AI, and everybody understands that they have a treasure trove of data that they would like to find a way to discover insight from. In the case of real applications that we're engaging now, you could just imagine that in the transportation industry, car companies creating self-driving cars, one car company after another needs to take all of their row data and start to train their neural networks for their future self-driving cars. And so they use our DGX or Tesla GPUs to train the networks, which is then used to run their cars running on DRIVE PX. So that's one application example. Another application example, which is quite significant, is going to be the future of processing all of the HD maps in the world. You guys might have seen that, we announced that GTC, this API SDK called MapWorks. MapWorks takes video information, video information that is recorded from a car, and reconstructs the three-dimensional terrain information from that live video. And so it has to do computer vision, 3D reconstruction. It has to determine and detect where the lanes are, the signs are, the lights are, and even some interesting 3D features, maybe buildings and curbs and such. And it will do that automatically. And we need to process that for the world, for the planet. And you can just imagine how much video is being recorded today, and how much data is being generated, and how much inferencing, computer vision and 3D reconstruction that has to be done, and our GPUs are really quite perfect for it. And so MapWorks runs on top of our GPUs, and we're working with just about every mapping company in the world today to adopt MapWorks, and to do HD processing for their maps. So that's another example. Medical imaging companies all over the world have recognized the importance of deep learning, and their ability to detect cancer and retinopathy, and the list of examples goes on and on. And so all the different modalities have now recognized the importance of deep learning, and you're going to start to see one medical imaging company after another. The list of examples just keep on going. I mean, the fact of the matter is, at this point deep learning and AI has really become how future software development is going to be done for a large number of industries. And that's the enthusiasm that we're seeing around the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations to the team on great results and guide. My first question is for Jen-Hsun. Jen-Hsun, on the adoption of VR for gaming, if I look at the price points of the headset and the PC, a little bit high for a wider adoption. Could the use of GPU in the cloud, like you guys are introducing the GeForce NOW, be a way for the price points on VR to come down? And then I have a follow up for Colette.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: The first year of VR has sold several hundred thousand units, and many hundreds of thousands of units. And our VR works, SDK, which allows us to process graphics in very low latency, dealing with all of the computer vision processing, whether it's lens warping and such, it has delivered really excellent results. The early VR is really targeted at early adopters. And I think the focus of ensuring an excellent experience that surprises people, that delight people, by Oculus and by Valve and by Epic and by Vive, by ourselves, by the industry, has really been a good focus. And I think that we've delivered on the promise of a great experience. The thing that we have to do now is that we have to make the headsets easier-to-use, with fewer cables. We have to make it lighter, we have to make it cheaper. And so those are all things that the industry is working on, and as the applications continue to come online, you're going to see that they're going to meet themselves and find success. I think the experience is very, very clear that VR is exciting. However, remember that we are also in the VR \u2013 we also brought VR to computer-aided design and to professional applications. In this particular area, the cost is just simply not an issue. And in fact, many of the applications previously were power walls or caves, VR caves that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. And now you could put that same experience, if not even better, on the desk of designers and creators. And so I think that you're going to find that creative use and professional use of VR is going to grow quite rapidly. And just recently, we announced a brand new Quadro 5000, P5000 with VR, the world's first VR notebook that went to market with HP and Dell. And they're doing terrifically. And so I would think about VR in the context of both professional applications as well as consumer applications, but I think the first year was absolutely a great success.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit Shah - Instinet, LLC: Yes. Thank you, and first of all, congratulations on a strong fiscal 2017. If I may, Jen-Hsun, the revenue beat this quarter wasn't as big as we've seen the last several periods, and most of it came from Datacenter. I totally understand that when the Gaming business expands as much as it has, it becomes harder to beat expectations by the same margin. But I was wondering if you could just spend some time talking about gaming demand, and how you think it was during the holiday season.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Well, the global PC gaming market is still vibrant and growing. And the number of eSports gamers around the world is growing. You guys know that Overwatch is a home run. Activision Blizzard's Overwatch is raging all over Asia and eSports fans all over the world are picking it up, and it's graphically very intensive. Without a 1050 class and above, it's simply a non-starter and to really enjoy it, you need at least a 1060. And so this last quarter we launched a 1050 and a 1050 Ti all over the world, and we're seeing terrific success out of that. And my expectation going into next year is that Overwatch is going to continue to spread all over the world. It's really basically just started. It started in the West and it's now moving into the East where the largest eSports markets are. And so Overwatch is going to be a huge success. League of Legends is going to continue to be a huge success. And my expectation is that the eSports along with AAA titles that are coming out this year is going to keep PC gaming continue to grow. And so I quite frankly thought Q4 was pretty terrific, and we had a record quarter. We had a record year, and I don't remember the last time that a large business the size of ours, and surely the size of a Datacenter business, grew by a factor of three. And so I think we're in a great position going into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah, thanks. Jen-Hsun, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of artificial intelligence, and kind of make a distinction between artificial intelligence versus machine learning versus deep learning? They're different kind of categorizations and implementations of those different sub-segments. So I wanted to get a sense from you how NVIDIA's end-to-end computing platform kind of dominates machine learning relative to, say, the competition. Then I have a question on the gross margins, if I could.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes. First of all thanks, thanks for the question. The way to think about that is deep learning is a breakthrough technique in the category of machine learning, and machine learning is an essential tool to enable AI, to achieve AI. If a computer can't learn, and if it can't learn continuously and adapt with the environment, there's no way to ever achieve artificial intelligence. Learning, as you know, is a foundational part of intelligence, and deep learning is a breakthrough technique where the software can write software by itself by learning from a large quantity of data. Prior to deep learning, other techniques like expert systems and rule-based systems and hand-engineered features, where engineers would write algorithms to figure out how to detect a cat, and then they would figure out how to write another algorithm to detect a car. You could imagine how difficult that is and how imperfect that is. It basically kind of works, but it doesn't work good enough, well enough to be useful. And then deep learning came along. The reason why deep learning took a long time to come along is because its singular handicap is that it requires an enormous amount of data to train the network, and it requires an enormous amount of computation. And that's why a lot of people credit the work that we've done with our programmable GPUs and our GPU computing platform and the early collaboration with deep learning. AI researchers as the big bang, if you will, the catalyst that made modern AI possible. We made it possible to crunch through an enormous amount of data to train these very deep neural networks. Now, the reason why deep learning has just swept the world, it started with a convolution of neural networks, but reinforcement networks and time sequence networks and all kinds of interesting adversarial networks. And the list of types of networks, I mean, there are 100 networks being created a week, and papers are coming out of everywhere. The reason why is because deep learning has proven to be quite robust. It is incredibly useful, and this tool has at the moment found no boundaries of problems that it's figured out how to solve. And I think that the traditional methods of machine learning are still going to be useful if the absolute precision of the prediction or classification is not necessarily super important. For example, if you wanted to understand the sentiment of consumers on a particular new product that you sent, whether the sentiment is exactly right, so long as you understand the basic trend, and you largely understand the sentiment, I think people would consider that information to be useful. However, if you're using machine learning for cancer detection, obviously we need to have a little precision that is quite high. And so whether it's in health care or financial services or high-performance computing and in some areas where, for example, ad supported Internet search, small differences in accuracy could make a very large difference in the financial results for the advertiser and for the people hosting the service. And so in all these cases, deep learning has found a great utility, and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much growth. And obviously for self-driving cars, being kind of right is not a good idea, and we like to be exactly right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you very much. Jen-Hsun, you guys obviously have won some business with your automotive supercomputer at Tesla in recent periods. And I was curious if you could comment on some of the application porting, and moving features from the previous architecture onto your architecture? And I guess how that's gone, and what you guys have learned through that process, and how it might be applied to some of your future partnerships. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure. First of all, you know that we are a full stack platform. The way we think about all of our platforms is from the application all the way back to the fundamental architecture in a semiconductor device. And so in the case of DRIVE PX, we created the architecture, optimized for neural net, for sensor fusion, for high-speed processing. The semiconductor design, in the case of DRIVE PX 2 called Tegra Parker, the system software for high-speed sensor fusion and moving data all the way around the car, the better you do that, the lower cost the system will be. The neural networks on top of that, that sits on top of our deep learning SDK, called cuDNN and TensorRT, basically frameworks of AI, and then on top of that, the actual algorithms for figuring out how to use that information from perception to localization to action planning. And then on top of that, we have an API and an SDK that is integrated into map makers, and we integrate into every single map, HD map service in the world, from HERE to TomTom to ZENRIN in Japan, to Baidu in China. So this entire stack is a ton of software. But your question specifically has to do with the perception layer. And that perception layer quite frankly is just a small part of the self-driving car problem. And the reason for that is because in the final analysis, you want to detect lanes. You've got video coming in, you want to detect lanes, you have video coming in, you want to detect the car in front of you. And all we have to do, it's not trivial, but it's also not monumental, we have to detect and sense the lanes and the cars and we train our networks to do so. And as you know very well now, that deep neural net has the ability to detect objects far better than any human engineer computer vision algorithms prior to deep learning. And that's one of the reasons why Tesla and others have jumped on top of the deep learning approach and abandoned traditional hand featured computer vision approaches. And so anyways, the answer to your question is that by working on self-driving cars, and we realized that this is a much more than computer vision, that the self-driving car platform is a stack of software and algorithms that's quite complex, and now we've had a lot of experience doing so. And then recently at CES, we announced partnerships with Audi, which we announced that we will have Level 4 self-driving cars on the road by 2020. We announced a partnership with Daimler, we announced a partnership with ZF and Bosch, two of the world's top Tier 1 suppliers. We also announced partnerships with all of the mapping companies. And so if you put all that stuff together, we have the processor, we have the tier one partnerships for the integration of the systems, we have all the software on top of it, the deep learning networks, the car partnerships of course, and integrated into maps around the world. And all that entire stack when you put them all together should allow us to have self-driving cars on the road.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the inference market. Where are you in terms of hyperscale adoption for specialized inference type solutions, and how big you think that market can ultimately be? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes. The inference market is going to be very large. And as you know very well, in the future almost every computing device will have inferencing on it. A thermostat will have inferencing on it, a bicycle lock will have inferencing on it, cameras will have inferencing on it, and self-driving cars would have a large amount of inferencing on it. Robots, vacuum cleaners, you name it, smart microphones, smart speakers, all the way into the data center. And so I believe that long-term there will be a trillion devices that has inferencing connected to edge computing devices near them, connected to cloud computing devices, cloud computing servers. So that's basically the architecture. And so the largest inferencing platform will likely be arm devices. I think that that goes without saying. Arm will likely be running inferencing networks, 1-bit XNOR, 8-bit, and even some floating-point. It just depends on what level of accuracy do you want to achieve, what level of perception do you want to achieve, and how fast do you want to perceive it? And so the inferencing market is going to be quite large. We're going to focus in markets where the inferencing precision, the inferencing, the perception scenario and the performance by which you have to do is mission-critical. And of course, self-driving cars is a perfect example of that. Robots, manufacturing robots, will be another example of that. In the future you're going to see in our GTC, if you have a chance to see that, we're working with AI City partners all over the world for end-to-end video analytics, and that requires very high throughput, a lot of computation. And so the examples go on and on, all the way back into the data center. In the data center, there are several areas where inferencing is quite vital. I mentioned one number earlier, just mapping the earth, mapping the earth at the street level, mapping the earth in HD, in three-dimensional level for self-driving cars. Now, that process is going to require, well, just a pile of GPUs running continuously as we continuously update the information that needs to be mapped. There's inferencing, which is called offline inferencing where you have to retrain a network after you deployed it, and you would likely retrain and re-categorize, reclassify the data using the same servers that you used for training. And so even the training servers will be used for inferencing. And then lastly, all of the nodes in cloud will be inferencing nodes in the future. I've said before that I believe that every single node in the cloud data center will have inferencing capability and accelerated inferencing capability in the future. I continue to believe that and these are all opportunities for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Long from Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hello. Can you hear me?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Toshiya from Goldman. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I had a question on gross margins. I think you're guiding Q1 gross margins only mildly below levels you saw in fiscal Q4, despite the royalty stream from Intel rolling over. And I'm guessing improvement of mix in Datacenter and parts of Gaming are driving this. But A, is that kind of the right way to think about the puts and takes going into Q1? And B, if that is indeed the case, should we expect gross margins to edge higher in future quarters and future years as data center becomes a bigger percentage of your business?\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, this is Colette. Let me see if I can help answer that. So you're correct in terms of how to look at that in Q1. The delta from Q4 to Q1 is, we only have a partial part of recognition from the Intel, and that stops in the middle of March. So as we move forward as well, going into Q2, we will also have the absence of what we had in Q1 moving to Q2. I'm not here to give guidance on Q2 because we just give guidance out one quarter, but keep that in mind, there's a partial amount of Intel still left in Q1 and then it depletes in Q2. If you think about our overall model, our overall business model, it has moved to higher and value-added platforms, and that's what we're selling. So our goal is absolutely to continue to concentrate on providing those higher-value platforms, that gives us the opportunity for gross margin as we make those investments in terms of an OpEx. We'll see what that kind of mix looks like as we go into Q2, but just to leave you with a understanding of Intel is probably what we can do here. Okay?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the Datacenter tightening, just given the expected sequential growth in that business during the April quarter, can you talk about what products are helping to drive that? Is it possibly the DGX-1 computer box or is it more GPUs for training purposes at the hyperscale cloud datacenter?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: It would have to be Tesla processors using in the cloud. There are several SKUs of Tesla processors. There's the Tesla processors used for high-performance computing, and it has FP64, FP32, ECC, it's designed, and has CUDA of course, and it has been optimized for molecular dynamics, astrophysics, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, the list goes on and on. The vast majority of the world's high-performance supercomputing applications, imaging applications, 3D reconstruction application, it has been ported onto our GPUs over the course of the last decade and some, and that's a very large part of our Tesla business. Then of course, we introduced on top of the architecture our deep learning stack. Our deep learning stack starts with cuDNN, the numerics kernels, a lot of algorithms inside them to be optimized for numerical processing of all kinds of different precisions. It's integrated into frameworks of different kinds. There's so many different frameworks, from TensorRT to Caffe to Torch to Theano to MXnet to CNTK, the work that we did with Microsoft, which is really excellent, scaling it up from one GPU to many GPUs across multiple racks, and that's our deep learning stack, and that's also very important. And then the third is GRID. GRID is a completely different stack. It's the world's first graphics virtualization stack, fully integrated into Citrix, integrated into VMware. Every single workstation and PC application has been verified, tested and has the ability to be streamed from a datacenter. And then last year, I think we announced it in \u2013 we started shipping it in August, our DGX-1, the world's first AI supercomputer appliance, which integrates a whole bunch more software of all different types, and has the ability to \u2013 we introduced our first NVIDIA docker. It containerizes applications. It makes it possible for you to have a whole bunch of users use one DGX. They could all be running different frameworks because most environments are heterogeneous. And so that's DGX-1. And it's got an exciting pipeline ahead of it, and it's really designed for companies and workgroups who don't want to build their own supercomputer like the hyperscalers, and aren't quite ready to move into the cloud because they have too much data to move to the cloud. And so everybody basically can easily buy a DGX-1. It's fully integrated, fully supported, and get to work on deep learning right away. And so each one of these are all part of our Datacenter business. But the largest, because it's been around the longest since our Tesla business, but they're all growing, every single one of them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James.\nJ. Steven Smigie - Raymond James Financial, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for the time. Just a quick question in the auto market. At CES, you had some solutions you were demonstrating. It showed in pretty significant decline in terms of the size and what was being offered. You really shrunk it down a lot, yet still having great performance. If you think out to sort of the Level 4 solution that you talked about for 2020, how small can you ultimately make that? It seems like you could be sort of relative to the size of the car pretty small. So just curious to hear your comment on that, and what impact having this system in the car makes on it.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: We currently have DRIVE PX. DRIVE PX today is a one-chip solution for Level 3. And with two chips, two processors, you can achieve Level 4. And with many processors, you could achieve Level 5 today. And some people are using many processors to develop their Level 5, and some people are using a couple of processors to develop their Level 4. Our next generation, so that's all based on the Pascal generation. That's all based on the Pascal generation. Our next generation, the processor is called Xavier. We announced that recently. Xavier basically takes four processors and shrink it into one. And so we'll be able to achieve Level 4 with one processor. That's the easiest way to think about it. So we'll achieve Level 3 with one processor today. Next year, we'll achieve Level 4 with one processor, and with several processors, you could achieve Level 5. But I think that the number of processors is really interesting because we need to do the processing of sensor fusion, and we got to do perception. We have to do localization. We have to do driving. There's a lot of functional safety aspects to it, failover functionality. There are all kinds of black box recorders, all kinds of different functionality that goes into the processor. And I think it's really quite interesting. But in the final analysis, what's really, really hard, and this is one of the reasons why our positioning in the autonomous driving market is becoming more and more clear, is that in the final analysis, there's really a software problem. And it's an end-to-end software problem. It goes all the way from processing, in the perception processing in the car to AI processing to helping you drive, connected to HD clouds for HD map processing all over the world. And so this end-to-end stack of software is really quite a large undertaking. I don't know where anybody else is currently doing that with the exception of one or two companies. And so I think that that's really where the great complexity is. We have the ability to see and optimize across the entire range. Now, the other thing that we announced at CES that's worth mentioning is that we believe in a future, Level 4 means that you will have autopilot capability, hands-free autopilot capability in many scenarios. However, it's unlikely to ensure and to guarantee that in every scenario that you can achieve Level 4. It's just not practical for some time. However, during those circumstances, we believe that the car should still have an AI, that the car should be monitoring what's happening outside and it should be monitoring the driver. And when it's not driving for you, it's looking out for you. And we call that the AI co-pilot. Whereas AI autopilot achieves Level 4 driving, AI co-pilot looks out for you in the event that it doesn't have the confidence to drive on your behalf. And so I believe that that's a really big breakthrough, and we're just seeing incredible excitement about it around the industry because I think it just makes a lot of sense. And the combination of the two systems allows us to achieve, build a better car.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for sneaking me in, and congratulations on the very good execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to come back to the Gaming platform. You've now got the business running at a $5 billion annualized run rate. So congratulations on the growth there. I think investors look at that as a business that's been built on the strength of a vibrant enthusiast market. But at CES, you announced the GeForce NOW offering, which really allows you to tap into the more casual potential gamer. So the question is, what will GeForce NOW do incrementally for the opportunity that you have with your Gaming platform?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, I appreciate that. I think, first of all, the PC gaming market is growing because of a dynamic that nobody ever expected, a dynamic that nobody ever expected 20 years ago. And that's basically how video games went from being a game to becoming a sport. And not only is it a sport, it's a social sport. And in order to play some of these modern eSports games, it's a five-on-five. and so you kind of need four other friends. And so as a result, in order to enjoy, to be part of this phenomenon that's sweeping the world, that it's rather sticky. And that's one of the reasons why Activision Blizzard is doing so well, that's one of the reasons why Tencent is doing so well. These two companies have benefited tremendously from the eSport dynamic, and we're seeing it all over the world. And although it's free to play for some people, of course, you need to have a reasonably good computer to run it. And that's one of the reasons why you need GeForce in your PC so that you can enjoy these sports. When it's also a sport, nobody likes to lose, and surely nobody likes to blame their equipment when they do lose. And so having GeForce, it gives you confidence and it gives you an edge, and for a lot of gamers it's just the gold standard. And so I think that number one, eSports is one the reasons why gaming continues to grow. And I think at this point it's fair to say that even though it's now the second most-watched spectator sport on the planet behind Super Bowl, it is also the second highest paid winning sport behind football. It will soon be the largest sport in the world, and I can't imagine too many young people long term not coming into this sport somehow and as this sport continues to expand in genres. And so that's one of the core reasons. Now, you asked a question about GeForce NOW, which I really appreciate. Now, the simple way to think about that is that there are many computers in the world that simply don't have the ability to enjoy video games, whether it's extremely thin and light notebooks, Apple Macs, Chromebooks, the integrated graphics that don't have very good capabilities, I think that the reasonable thing to do is to put the technology in the cloud, and it took us some five years to make this possible, to put the technology in the cloud and stream the video game experience with very low latency to the computer like Netflix does. And so we're basically turning the PC into a virtualized gaming experience and putting that into cloud. So I don't know exactly how big it's going to be yet, but our aspiration is that, that we would reach the parts of the markets where they're casual, or they just want to have another way, another device where they can game or somebody would like to come into the gaming world, and isn't quite ready to invest the time in building a computer or buying into a GeForce PC yet. So I'm anxious to learn from it, and when I learn more about GeForce, then I'll be more than happy to share it.\nOperator: Unfortunately, that is all the time we have for questions. Do you have any closing remarks?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I want to thank all of you guys for following us. We had a record year, a record quarter. And most importantly, we're at the beginning of the AI computing revolution. This is a new form of computing, new way of computing, where parallel data processing is vital to success, and GPU computing that we've been nurturing for the last decade and some is really the perfect computing approach. We're seeing tremendous growth and exciting growth in the data center market. Datacenter now represents, had grew 3x over year-over-year, and it's on its way to become a very significant business for us. Gaming is a significant business for us, and longer term, self-driving cars is going to be a really exciting growth opportunity. The thing that has really changed our company, what really defines how our company goes to market today, is really the platform approach, that instead of just building a chip that is industry standard, we created software stacks on top of it to serve vertical markets that we believe will be exciting long term that we can serve. And we find ourselves incredibly well positioned now in gaming, in AI and in self-driving cars. I want to thank all of you guys for following NVIDIA, and have a great year.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Arnab. Revenue reached a record in the third quarter, exceeding $2 billion for the first time. Driving this was success in our Pascal-based gaming platform and growth in our datacenter platform, reflecting the role of NVIDIA's GPU as the engine of AI computing. Q3 revenue increased 54% from a year earlier to $2 billion and was up 40% from the previous quarter. Strong year-over-year gains were achieved across all four of our platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive. The GPU business was up 53% to $1.7 billion and the Tegra processor business increased 87% to $241 million. Let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue crossed the $1 billion mark and increased 63% year-on-year to a record $1.24 billion, fueled by our Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region across desktop and notebook, and across the full gaming audience, from GTX 1050 to the TITAN X. GeForce gaming PC notebooks recorded significant gains. Our continued growth in the GTX gaming GPUs reflects the unprecedented performance and efficiency gains in the Pascal architecture. It delivers seamless play on games and richly immersive VR experiences. In Q3, for desktops, we launched the GTX 1050 and the 1050 Ti, bringing eSports and VR capabilities at great value. For notebooks, we introduced GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060, giving gamers a major leap forward in performance and efficiency in a mobile experience. The fundamentals of the gaming market remain strong. The production value of blockbuster games continues to increase. Gamers are upgrading to higher-end GPUs to enjoy highly anticipated fall titles like Battlefield 1, Gears of War 3, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and eSports is attracting a new generation of gamers to the PC. League of Legends is played by over 100 million gamers each month and there is now a Twitch audience of more than 300 million who follow eSports. VR and AR will redefine entertainment and gaming. A great experience requires a high performance GPU, and we believe we're still in the early innings of these evolving markets. Pascal represents not only the biggest innovation gains we've made in a single GPU generation in a decade; it's also our best executed product rollout. Moving to professional visualizations, Quadro revenue grew 9% from a year ago to $207 million, driven by growth in the high-end of the market for real-time rendering and mobile workstations. We are seeing strong customer interest in the Pascal-based P6000 among digital entertainment leaders like Pixar, Disney and ILM, architectural, engineering and construction companies like Japan's Shimizu, and automotive companies like Hyundai. Next: datacenter. Revenue nearly tripled from a year ago and was up 59% sequentially to $240 million. Growth was strong across all fronts in AI and supercomputing for hyperscale, as well as for GRID, virtualization and supercomputing. GPU deep learning is revolutionizing AI, and is poised to impact every industry worldwide. Hyperscale companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu are using it to solve problems for their billions of consumers. Cloud GPU computing has shown explosive growth. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and AliCloud are deploying NVIDIA GPUs for AI, data analytics and HPC. AWS has recently announced its new EC2 P2 instance, which scales up to 16 GPUs to accelerate a wide range of AI applications, including image and video recognition, unstructured data analytics and video transcoding. We saw strong growth in AI training. For AI inference, we announced the Tesla P4 and P40 to serve power efficient and high performance workloads respectively. Shipments began in Q3 for the DGX-1 AI supercomputer. Early users include major universities like Stanford, UC Berkeley and NYU, leading research groups such as OpenAI, the German Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and the Swiss Artificial Intelligence Lab, as well as multinationals like SAP. So far this year, our GPU technology conference program has reached 18,000 developers and ecosystem partners, underscoring the broad enthusiasm for AI. Complementing our major spring event in Silicon Valley, we have organized GTCs in seven cities on four continents. They drew sellout audiences in Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Amsterdam, Melbourne and Washington D.C., with Mumbai still to come. Along with 400 sessions and labs, we provided training in AI skills to nearly 2,000 individuals through our Deep Learning Institute instruction program. We also have begun partnering with key global companies to enable the adoption of AI. To implement AI in manufacturing, we announced a collaborative with Japan's FANUC, focused on robots and automated factories. And in the transportation sector, more than 80 OEMs, Tier 1s and startups are using our GPUs for their work on self-driving cars. Our GRID graphics virtualization business continues to achieve extremely strong growth. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly manufacturing, automotive, engineering and education. Among customers added this quarter were Johns Hopkins University and GE Global India. And finally, in automotive, revenue increased to a record $127 million, up 61% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially from premium infotainment products. NVIDIA is developing an end-to-end AI computing platform for autonomous driving. This allows carmakers to collect and label data, train their own deep neural networks on the video GPUs in the datacenter, and then process them in the car with DRIVE PX 2. We have also been developing a cloud-to-car HD mapping system with mapping companies all over the world. Two such partnerships were announced this quarter. We're working with Baidu to create a cloud-to-car development platform with HD maps, Level 3 autonomous vehicles and automated parking. We're also partnering with TomTom to develop a AI-based cloud-to-car mapping system that enables real-time in-car localization and mapping. We've developed an integrated, scalable AI platform with capabilities ranging from automated highway driving to fully autonomous driving operation. We are extending the DRIVE PX 2 architecture to scale in performance and power consumption. It will range from DRIVE PX 2 AutoCruise with a single SoC for self-driving on highways, up to multiple DRIVE PX 2 computers capable of enabling fully autonomous driving. We also announced a single-chip AI supercomputer called Xavier with over 7 billion transistors. Xavier incorporates our next GPU architecture, a custom CPU design, and a new computer vision accelerator. Xavier will deliver performance equivalent to today's full DRIVE PX 2 board and its two Parker SoCs and two Pascal GPUs, while only consuming a fraction of the energy. Finally, Tesla Motors announced last month that all its factory produced vehicles, the Model S, the Model X and upcoming Model 3, feature a new AutoPilot system powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 platform and will be capable of fully autonomous operation via future software updates. This system delivers over 40 times the processing power of the previous technology and runs a new neural network for vision, sonar and data processing. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and IP business was $186 million, down 4% year-on-year. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. GAAP gross margin for Q3 was a record 59% and non-GAAP gross margin was a record 59.2%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success for our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $544 million, including $66 million in stock-based compensation and other charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million, up 11% from a year earlier. This reflects head count-related costs for our growth initiatives as well as investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to invest in deep learning to capture this once in a lifetime opportunity. Thus, we would expect the operating expense growth rate to be sustained over the next several quarters. GAAP operating income was $639 million. Non-GAAP operating income more than doubled to $708 million. Non-GAAP operating margins were over 35% this quarter. For fiscal year 2018, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We also announced a 22% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share. Now, turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin are expected to be 59% and 59.2%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $572 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. With that, operator, I'm going turn it back to you and see if we can take some questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter. I think to start out, Jen-Hsun, maybe if you could help us understand. The datacenter business tripled year-over-year. What's going on in that business that's enabling that to happen? If you could maybe talk about \u2013 I don't know if it's on the technology side or the end market side. And maybe as part of that, you can help us maybe deconstruct the revenues and what's really driving that growth? And I had a follow-up too. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure. A couple things. First of all, GPU computing is more important than ever. There are so many different types of applications that require GPU computing today, and it's permeating all over enterprise. There are several applications that we're really driving. One of them is graphics virtualization, application virtualization. Partnering with VMware and Citrix, we've essentially taken very compute-intensive, very graphics-intensive applications, virtualizing it and putting it into the datacenter. The second is computational sciences; using our GPU for general purpose scientific computing. And scientific computing, as you know, is not just for scientists; it's running equations and using numerics is a tool that is important to a large number of industries. And then, third, one of the most exciting things that we're doing because of deep learning, we've really ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world. These several applications, graphics application and virtualization, computational science and data science has really driven our opportunity in the datacenter. The thing that made it possible, though, the thing that really made it possible was really the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general purpose processor. And then, on top of that, probably the more important part of that, is transforming from a chip company to a platform company. What made application and graphics virtualization possible is a complicated stack of software we call GRID. And you guys have heard me talk about it for several years now. And second, in the area of numerics and computational sciences, CUDA, our rich library of applications and libraries on top of numerics \u2013 numerical libraries on top of CUDA and all the tools that we have invested in, the ecosystem we've worked with, all the developers all around the world that now know how to use CUDA to develop applications makes that part of our business possible. And then third, our deep learning toolkit; the NVIDIA deep learning \u2013 GPU deep learning tool kit has made it possible for all frameworks in the world to get GPU acceleration. And with GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible. It's not 20%, it's not 50%, it's 20 times, 50 times. And that translates to, most importantly, for researchers, the ability to gain access to insight much, much faster. Instead of months, it could be days. It's essentially like having a time machine. And secondarily, for IT managers, it translates to lower energy consumption and, most importantly, it translates to a substantial reduction in datacenter cost, whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers, and so a pretty big deal. Great value proposition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the consistent growth and execution. Jen-Hsun, one more on the datacenter business. It has obviously grown very strongly this year. But, in the past, it has been lumpy. So, for example, when I go back to your fiscal 2015, it grew 60% to 70% year-on-year. Last year, it grew about 7%. This year it's growing over 100%. How should we think about the diversity of customers and the diversity of applications to help us forecast how the business can grow over the next one or two years?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, I think embedded in your question, in fact, are many of the variables that influence our business. Especially in the beginning, several years ago when we started working on GPU computing and bringing this capability into datacenters, we relied on supercomputing centers in the beginning and then we relied on remote workstations, datacenter workstations, if you will; virtualized workstations. And then increasingly, we started relying on \u2013 we started seeing demand from hyperscale datacenters as they used our GPUs for deep learning and to develop their networks. And then, now, we're starting to see datacenters take advantage of our new GPUs, P40 and P4, to apply to operate to use the networks for inferencing in a large scale way. And so, I think we're moving, if you will, our datacenter business in multiple trajectories. The first trajectory is the number of applications we can run. Our GPUs now has the ability with one architecture to run all of those applications that I mentioned from graphics virtualization to scientific computing to AI. Second, we used to be in datacenters, but now we're in datacenters, supercomputing centers as well as hyperscale datacenters. And then third, the number of applications, industries that we affect is growing. It used to start with supercomputing. Now, we have supercomputing, we have automotive, we have oil and gas, we have energy discovery, we have financial services industry, we have, of course, one of the largest industries in the world, consumer Internet cloud services. And so we're starting to see applications in all of those different dimensions. And I think that the combination of those three things, the number of applications, the number of platforms and locations by which we have success, and then, of course, the number of industries that we affect, the combination of that should give us more upward directory in a consistent way. But I think the really \u2013 the mega point though is really the size of the industries we're now able to engage. In no time in the history of our company have we ever been able to engage industries of this magnitude. And so that's the exciting part I think in the final analysis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, you've been on the road quite a bit over the past few months, and I'm sure you've had the opportunity to connect with many of your important customers and partners. Can you maybe share with us what you learned from the multiple trips and how your view on the company's long-term growth trajectory changed, if at all?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Toshiya. First of all, the reason why I've been on the road for almost two months solid is because the request and the demand if you will from developers all over the world for a better understanding of GPU computing and getting access to our platform and learning about all of the various applications that GPUs can now accelerate. The demand is just really great. And we no longer could do GTC, which is our developer conference \u2013 essentially, our developer conference. We can no longer do GTC just here in Silicon Valley. And so we, this year, decided to take it on the road and we went to China, went to Taiwan, went to Japan, went to Korea. We had one in Australia and also one in India and Washington D.C., and Amsterdam for Europe. And so we pretty much covered the world with our first global developer conference. I would say, probably, the two themes that came out of it is that GPU acceleration, the GPU has really reached a tipping point. That it is so available everywhere; it's available in PCs, it's available from every computer company in the world, it's in the cloud, it's in the datacenter, it's in laptops. GPU is no longer a niche component. It is a large scale, massively available, general purpose computing platform. And so I think people realize now the benefits of GPU and that the incredible speedup or cost reduction, however, basically the opposite sides of a coin that you can get with GPUs, and so GPU computing. Number two is AI; just the incredible enthusiasm around AI. And the reason for that, of course, for everybody who knows already about AI, what I'm going to say is pretty clear, but there's a large number of applications, problems, challenges where a numerical approach is not available. A laws of physics based, equation-based approach is not available. And these problems are very complex. Oftentimes, the information is incomplete and there's no laws of physics around it. For example, what's the laws of physics of what I look like? What's the laws of physics for recommending tonight's movie? And so those kind \u2013 there's no laws of physics involved. And so the question is, how do you solve those kind of incomplete problems? There's no laws of physics equation that you can program into a car that causes the car to drive and drive properly. These are artificial intelligence problems. Search is an artificial intelligence problem. Recommendation is an artificial intelligence problem. And so now that GPU deep learning has ignited this capability and it has made it possible for machines to learn from a large amount of data and to determine the features by itself, to compute the features to recognize, GPU deep learning has really ignited this wave of AI revolution. And so I would say, the second thing that is just incredible enthusiasm around the world is learning how to use the GPU deep learning, how to use it to solve AI type problems and to do so in all of the industries that we know, from healthcare to transportation to entertainment to enterprise to you name it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Atif Malik with Citigroup.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulation. You mentioned that a Maxwell upgrade was about 30% of your (27:01-27:06) roughly two years (27:10) and should we be thinking about like a two-year time where (27:15-27:20).\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Atif, first of all, there were several places where you cut out and this is one of those artificial intelligence problems. Because I heard incomplete information, but I'm going to infer from some of the important words that I did hear and I'm going to apply artificial \u2013 in this case \u2013 human intelligence to see if I can predict what it is that you were trying to ask. I think you were \u2013 the baseline \u2013 the basis of your question was that Maxwell, in the past, in the past, Maxwell, GPU during that generation, we saw an upgrade cycle about every two or three years. And we had an installed base of some 60 million, 80 million gamers during that time and several years have now gone by. And the question is what would be the upgrade cycle for Pascal and what would it look like? And there are several things that have changed that I think is important to note, and that could affect a Pascal upgrade. First of all, the increase in adoption, the number of units has grown and the number of the ASP has grown. And I think the reason for that is several folds. I think, one, the number of gamers in the world is growing. Everybody that is effectively born in the last 10, 15 years are likely to be a gamer. And so long as they have access to electricity and the Internet, they're very likely a gamer. The quality of games has grown significantly. And one of the factors of production value of games that has been possible is because the PC and the two game consoles, Xbox and PlayStation, and in the future \u2013 in the near-future, the Nintendo Switch, all of these architectures are common in the sense that they all use modern GPUs, they all use programmable shading and they all have basically similar features. They have very different design points, they have different capabilities, but they have very similar architectural features. As a result of that, game developers can target a much larger installed base with one common code base and, as a result, they can increase the production quality, production value of the games. The second \u2013 and one of the things that you might have noticed that recently PlayStation and Xbox both announced 4K versions, basically the Pro versions of their game console. That's really exciting for the game industry. It's really exciting for us, because what's going to happen is the production value of games will amp up and, as a result, it would increase the adoption of higher-end GPUs. So, I think that that's a very important positive. That's probably the second one. The first one being the number of gamers is growing. The second is game production value continues to grow. And then the third is gaming is no longer just about gaming. Gaming is part sports \u2013 part gaming, part sports and part social. There are a lot of people who play games just so they can hang out with their other friends who are playing games. And so it's a social phenomenon and then, of course, because games are \u2013 the quality of games, the complexity of games in some such as League of Legends, such as StarCraft, the real-time simulation, the real-time strategy component of it, the agility \u2013 the hand-eye coordination part of it, the incredible teamwork part of it is so great that it has become sport. And because there are so many people in gaming, because there is \u2013 it's a fun thing to do and it's hard to do, so it's hard to master, and the size of the industry is large, it's become a real sporting event. And one of the things that I'll predict is that one of these days I believe that gaming would likely be the world's largest sport industry. And the reason for that is because it's the largest industry. There are more people who play games and now enjoy games and watch other people play games than there are people who play football for example. And so I think it stands to reason that eSports will be the largest sporting industry in the world. And that's just a matter of time before it happens. And so I think all of these factors have been driving both the increase in the size of the market for us as well as the ASP of the GPUs for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, first question if I could on your comments regarding the GRID systems; you mentioned some accelerating demand in the manufacturing and automotive verticals. Just kind of wondering if you had any thoughts on what inning you're currently in, in terms of seeing a strong ramp-up towards a full run rate for those areas and especially for the broader corporate enterprise, end market vertical also? As a quick follow-up on the gaming side, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on whether or not there's still a big gap between the ramp-up of Pascal supply and the pent-up demand for those new products. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure. So, I would say that we're probably in the first at bat of the first inning of GRID, and the reason for that is this. We've prepared ourselves. We went to spring training camp. We came up through the \u2013 they call it the farm league or something like that. I'm not really a baseball player, but I heard some people talk about it. And so I think we're probably at the first at bat at the first inning. The thing that \u2013 the reason why I'm excited about it is because I believe in the future applications are virtualized in the datacenter or in the cloud. On first principles, on first principles, I believe that data applications will be virtualized and that you'll be able to enjoy these applications irrespective of whether you're using a PC, a Chrome notebook, a Mac or a Linux Workstation. It simply won't matter. And yet, on the other hand, I believe that in the future, applications will become increasingly GPU accelerated. And so, how do you put something in the cloud that have no GPUs and how do you GPU accelerate these applications that are increasingly GPU accelerated? And so, the answer is of course putting GPUs in the cloud and putting GPUs in datacenters. And that's what GRID is all about. It's about virtualization, it's about putting GPUs in large scale datacenters and be able to virtualize the applications so that we can enjoy it on any computer, on any device and putting computing closer to the data. So, I think we're just in the beginning of that. And that could explain why GRID is, finally, after a long period of time of building the ecosystem, building the infrastructure, developing all the software, getting the quality of service to be just really exquisite, working with the ecosystem partners, it's really taken off. And I could surely expect to see it continue to grow at the rate that we're seeing for some time. In terms of Pascal, we are still ramping. Production is fully ramped in the sense that all of our products are fully qualified, they're on the market, they have been certified and qualified with OEMs. However, demand is still fairly high. And so we're going to continue to work hard, and our manufacturing partner TSMC is doing a great job for us. The yields are fantastic for 2016 FinFET, and they're just doing a fantastic job supporting us. And so we're just going to keep running at it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thank you very much. Great quarter by the way; I'm still amazed how good this is. Can you talk a little bit about the size of the inference opportunity? Obviously, you guys have done really well in training. I assume penetrating inference is reasonably early on. But can you talk about how you see GPUs competitively versus FPGAs on that side of it and how big you think that opportunity could become? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure. I'll start backwards. I'll start backwards and answer the FPGA question first. FPGA is good in a lot of things, and anything that you could do in an FPGA if the market opportunity is large, you could always \u2013 it's always better to develop an ASIC. And FPGA is what you use when the volume is not large. FPGA is what you use when you're not certain about the functionality you want to put into something. FPGA is largely useful when the volume's not large, because you can build an ASIC and build a full custom chip that obviously can deliver more performance, not 20% more performance but 10 times better performance and better energy efficiency than you could using FPGAs. And so I think that's a well-known fact. Our strategy is very different than any of that. Our strategy is really about building a computing platform. Our GPU is not a specific function thing anymore. It's a general purpose parallel processor. CUDA can do molecular dynamics, it could do fluid dynamics, it could do partial differential equations, it could do linear algebra, it could do artificial intelligence, it could be used for seismic analysis, it could be used for computer graphics, even computer graphics, and so our GPU is incredibly flexible. And it's really designed for \u2013 it's designed specifically for parallel throughput computing. And by combining it with the CPU, we've created a computing platform that is both good at sequential information, sequential instruction processing as well as very high throughput data processing. And so we've created a computing architecture that's good at both of those things. The reason why we believe that's important is because several things. We want to build a computing platform that is useful to a large industry. You could use it for AI, you could use it for search, you could use it for video transcoding, you could use it for energy discovery, you could use it for health, you could use it for finance, you could use it for robotics, you could use it for all these different things. So, on the first principles, we're trying to build a computing platform. It's a computing architecture and not a dedicated application thingy. And most of the customers that we're calling on, most of the markets that we're addressing and the areas that we've highlighted are all computer users. They need to use and deploy a computing platform and have the benefit of being able to rapidly improve their AI networks. AI is still in the early days. It's the early days of early days. And so GPU deep learning is going through innovations at a very fast clip. Our GPU allows people to learn \u2013 to develop new networks and deploy new networks as quickly as possible. And so I think the way to think about it is, is think of our GPU as a computing platform. In terms of the market opportunity, the way I would look at it is this. The way I would look at it is, there are something along the lines of 5 million to 10 million hyperscale datacenter nodes. And I think \u2013 and you guys have heard me say this before \u2013 I think that tree is a new set of HPC clusters that have been added into these datacenters. And then the next thing that's going to happen is that you're going to see GPUs being added to a lot of these 5 million to 10 million nodes, so that you could accelerate every single query that will likely come into the datacenter will be an AI query in the future. And so, I think GPUs have an opportunity to see a fairly large hyperscale installed base. But, beyond that, there's the enterprise market. Although a lot of computing is done in the cloud, a great deal of computing, especially the type of computing that we're talking about here that requires a lot of data, we're a data throughput machine, the type of computers that we're talking about tends to be one (40:36) enterprise. And I believe a lot of the enterprise market is going to go towards AI and the type of things that we're looking for in the future is to simplify our business processes using AI, to find business intelligence or insight using AI, to optimize our supply chain using AI, to optimize our forecasting using AI, to optimize the way that we find and surprise and delight customers, digital customers or customers in digital, using AI. And so, all of these parts of the business operations of large companies, I think AI can really enhance. And then the third \u2013 so hyperscale, enterprise computing, and then the third is something very, very new, it's called IoT. IoT, we're going have a trillion things. We're going to have a trillion things connected to the Internet over time, and they're going be measuring things from vibration to sound to images to temperature to air pressure to you name it. Okay? And so these things are going be all over the world and we're going to measure \u2013 we're going to be constantly measuring and monitoring their activity. And using the only thing that we can imagine that can help to add value to that and find insight from that is really AI. Using deep learning, we could have these new types of computers. And they will likely be on premise or near the location of the cluster of things that you have. And monitor all of these devices and prevent them from failing, or adding intelligence to it so that they add more value to what it is that people have them do. So, I think the size of the marketplace that we're addressing is really larger than any time in our history. And probably, the easiest way to think about it is we're now a computing platform company. We're simply a computing platform company and our focus is GPU computing, and one of the major applications is AI.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the stellar execution. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to go back to the automotive business. In the past, the company has mentioned that revenues consist of display and then on the autopilot side, both consulting and product revenues, but I think much more intensively on the consulting side for now. But as we look ahead to Xavier and the announcement that you had made inter-quarter that that's coming late next year, how should we expect that the revenue mix would evolve, not just from consulting to product but from Parker towards Xavier?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, that's \u2013 I don't know that I have really granular breakdowns for you, Craig, partly because I'm just not sure. But I think the dynamics are that self-driving cars is probably the most single most disruptive event \u2013 the most disruptive dynamic that's happening in the automotive industry. It's almost impossible for me to imagine that in five years' time, a reasonably capable car will not have autonomous capability at some level, and a very significant level at that. And I think what Tesla has done by launching and having on the road in the very near-future here, a full autonomous driving capability using AI, that has sent a shock wave through the automotive industry. It's basically five years ahead. Anybody who's talking about 2021 and that's just a non-starter anymore. And I think that that's probably the most significant bit in the automotive industry. I just don't \u2013 anybody who is talking about autonomous capabilities in 2020 and 2021 is at the moment re-evaluating in a very significant way. And so I think that, of course, will change how our business profile ultimately looks. It depends on those factors. Our autonomous vehicle strategy is relatively clear, but let me explain it anyways. Number one, we believe that autonomous vehicles is not a detection problem. It's an AI computing problem. That it's not just about detecting objects, it's about perception of the environment around you, it's about reasoning, reasoning about what to do, what is happening and what to do and to take action based on that reasoning, and to be continuously learning. And so I think that AI computing requires a fair amount of computation. And anybody who thought that it would take only 1 watt or 2 watt, basically, the amount of energy of \u2013 well, I'm not even \u2013 one-third the energy of a cell phone, I think it's just unfortunate and it's not going to happen any time soon. And so I think people now recognize that AI computing is a very software-rich problem and it is a supremely exciting AI problem, and that deep learning and GPUs could add a lot of value. And it's going happen in 2017. It's not going to happen in 2021. And so I think number one. Number two, our strategy is to deploy a one architecture platform that is open that car companies could work on to leverage our software stack and create their network, their artificial intelligence network. And then we would address everything from highway cruising, excellent highway cruising to all the way to full autonomous to trucks to shuttles. And using one computing architecture, we could apply it for radar-based systems or radar plus cameras, radar plus cameras plus lidars, we could use it for all kinds of sensor fusion environments. And so I think \u2013 our strategy, I think, is really resonating well with the industry as people now realize that we need the computation capability five years earlier. That we \u2013 that it's not a detection problem, but it's an AI computing problem and that software is really intensive. That these three observations, I think, has put us in a really good position.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter across the board. I did want to return to the automotive segment, because the datacenter segment is talked about at length. With the new DRIVE PX platform increasing potentially the ASPs, how do we just think about ASPs for automotive going forward? And if I recall, you guys had about $30 million in backlog in terms of cars, I'm not sure, if possible maybe you can update there as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Let's see. I guess our architecture for DRIVE PX, Mitch, is at scalable. And so you could start from one Parker SoC and that allows you to have surround camera. It allows you to use AI for highway cruising. And if you would like to have even more cameras, so that your functionality could be used more frequently in more conditions, you could always add more processors. And so we go from one to four processors. And if it's a fully autonomous driverless car, a driverless taxi, for example, you might need more than even four of our processors. You might need eight processors. You might need 12 processors. And the reason for that is because you need to reduce the circumstance by which autopilot doesn't work \u2013 doesn't turn on, excuse me, doesn't engage, and because you don't have a driver in the car at all. And so I think that depending on the application that you have, we'll have a different configuration and it's scalable. And it ranges from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. And so I think it just depends on what configuration people are trying to deploy. Now, for a few thousand dollars, the productivity of that vehicle is incredible as you can simply do the math. It's much more available, the cost of operations is reduced, and a few thousand dollars is surely almost nothing in the context of that use case.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid execution and growth. Looking at some of your cloud customers, new services offerings, you guys mentioned AWS, the EC2 P2 platform, you have Microsoft Azure Cloud Services platforms, it's interesting because they're ramping new instances primarily using your K80 Accelerator platform, which means that the Maxwell-based and, the recently introduced, Pascal-based adoption curves are still way ahead of the team, which obviously is a great setup as it relates to the continued strong growth going forward. Can you just help us understand why the long design end-cycle times for these accelerators? And when do you expect the adoption curve for the Maxwell-based accelerators to start to kick in with some of your cloud customers?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, Harlan, good question. And it's exactly the reason why having started almost five years ago in working with all of these large scale datacenters is what it takes. And the reason for that is because several things has to happen. Applications has to be developed. Their hyperscale, which is their enterprise \u2013 their datacenter level software has to accommodate this new computing platform. The neural networks have to be developed and trained and ready for deployment. The GPUs have to be tested against every single datacenter and every single server configuration that they have. And it takes that type of time to deploy at the scales that we're talking about. And so I think that that's number one. The good news is, is that between Kepler and Maxwell and Pascal, the architecture is identical, even though the underlying architecture has been improved dramatically and the performance increases dramatically, the software layer is the same. And so that's \u2013 the adoption rate of our future generation is going be much, much faster and you'll see that. But it takes that long to integrate our software and our architecture and our GPUs into all of the datacenters around the world. It takes a lot of work. It takes a long time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, Jen-Hsun. I just wanted to ask regarding the AutoPilot win, we know that you guys displaced Mobileye, and I was just curious if you could talk about why Tesla chose your GPU and what you can sort of give us in terms of the ramp and timing. And how does this \u2013 how would a ramp like this affect automotive gross margin?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I think there are three things that we offer today. The first thing is that it's not a detection problem it's an AI computing problem. And a computer has processors, and the architecture is coherent and you can program it, you can write software, you can compile to it. It's an AI computing problem. And our GPU computing architecture has the benefit of 10 years of refinement. In fact, this year is the 10-year anniversary of our first GPU, our first CUDA GPU called G80. And we've been working on this for 10 years. And so the number one is autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles is a AI computing problem. It's not a detection problem. Second, car companies realize that they need to deliver, ultimately, a service, that the service is a network of cars by which they continuously improve. It's like phones. It's like phones. It's like set-top boxes. You have to maintain and serve that customer because they're interested in the service of autonomous driving. It's not a functionality. Autonomous driving is always being improved with better maps and better driving behavior and better perception capability and better AI. And so the software component of it, the software component of it and the ability for car companies to own their own software once they develop it on our platform is a real positive. And real positive to the point where it's enabling or it's essential for the future of the driving fleet. And then the third \u2013 to be able to continue to do OTA on. And third is simply the performance and energy level. I don't believe it's actually possible at this moment in time to deliver an AI computing platform of the performance level that is required to do autonomous driving and an energy efficiency level that is possible in a car and to put all that functionality together in a reasonable way. I believe DRIVE PX 2 is the only viable solution on the planet today. And so I \u2013 because Tesla had a great intention to deliver this level of capability to the world five years ahead of anybody else, we were a great partner for them. Okay? So those are probably the three reasons.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jen-Hsun, I make an interesting observation about your commentary that your company has gone from a sort of a graphic accelerator company to a computing platform company, and I think that's fantastic. One of the things that I wonder as maybe AI and deep learning acceleration sort of standardize on your platform, what you're seeing and hearing in the Valley about startup activity and folks that are trying to innovate around the platform that you're bringing up both complementary to what you're doing and potentially really long-term competitive to what you're doing. I'd just love to hear your perspectives on that. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, Matthew. I really appreciate that. We see just a large number of AI startups around the world. There's a very large number here in the United States, of course. There's quite a significant number in China. There is a very large number in Europe. There's a large number in Canada. It's pretty much a global event. The number of software companies that have now jumped onto using GPU deep learning and taking advantage of the computing platform that we've taken almost seven years to build and is really quite amazing. We're tracking about 1,500. We have a program called Inception. And Inception is our startup support program, if you will. They can get access to our early technology, they can get access to our expertise, our computing platform, and all that we've learned about deep learning we can share with many of these startups. As they're trying to use deep learning in industries from cyber security to genomics to consumer applications, computational finance to IoT, robotics, self-driving cars, the number of startups out there is really quite amazing. And so our deep learning platform is a real unique advantage for them because it's available in a PC. So you can \u2013 almost anybody with even a couple hundred dollars of spending money can get a startup going with a NVIDIA GPU that can do deep learning. It's available from system builders and server OEMs all over the world, HP, Dell, Cisco, IBM, system builders, small system builders, local system builders all over the world. And very importantly, it's available in cloud datacenters all over the world. So, the Amazon AWS, Microsoft's Azure cloud has a really fantastic implementation ready to scale out. You've got the IBM Cloud, you've got Alibaba Cloud. So, if you have a few dollars an hour for computing, you pretty much can get a company started and use the NVIDIA platform in all of these different places. And so it's an incredibly productive platform because of its performance. It works with every framework in the world. It's available basically everywhere. And so, as a result of that, we've given artificial intelligence startups anywhere on the planet the ability to jump on and create something. And so our \u2013 the availability, if you will, the marketization of deep learning, NVIDIA's GPU deep learning, is really quite enabling for startups.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks very much. It was really impressive that 60% growth in your gaming revenues. So does this imply that there was a 60% jump in cards that are being sold by online retailers and retail stores or does the growth reflect new channels through which NVIDIA gaming products are getting to customers?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: It's largely the same channels. Our channel has been pretty stable for some time. And we have a large network. I appreciate the question. It's one of our great strengths, if you will. We cultivated over two decades a network of partners who take the GeForce platform out to the world. And you could access our GPUs, you can access GeForce and be part of the GeForce PC gaming platform from literally anywhere on the planet. And so that's a real advantage and we're really proud of them. I guess you could also say that Nintendo contributed a fair amount to that growth. And over the next \u2013 as you know, the Nintendo architecture and the company tends to stick with an architecture for a very long time. And so we've worked with them now for almost two years. Several hundred engineering years have gone into the development of this incredible game console. I really believe when everybody sees it and enjoy it, they're going be amazed by it. It's really like nothing they've ever played with before. And of course, the brand, their franchise and their game content is incredible. And so I think this is a relationship that will likely last two decades and I'm super excited about it.\nOperator: We have no more time for questions.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Well, thank you very much for joining us today. I would leave you with several thoughts that, first, we're seeing growth across all of our platforms from gaming to pro-graphics to cars to datacenters. The transformation of our company from a chip company to a computing platform company is really gaining traction. Now you could see that the results of our work as a result of things like GameWorks and GFE and DriveWorks, all of the AI that goes on top of that, our graphics virtualization remoting platform called GRID to the NVIDIA GPU deep learning toolkit, are just really, really examples of how we've transformed a company from a chip to a computing platform company. In no time in the history of our company have we enjoyed and addressed an exciting large markets as we have today, whether it's artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, the gaming market, as it continues to grow and evolve and virtual reality. And of course, we all know now very well that GPU deep learning has ignited a wave of AI innovation all over the world. And our strategy and the thing that we've been working on for the last seven years is building an end-to-end AI computing platform, an end-to-end AI computing platform, starting from GPUs that we have optimized and evolved and enhanced for deep learning to system architectures, to algorithms for deep learning, to tools necessary for developers, to frameworks and the work that we do with all of the framework developers and AI researchers around the world, to servers, to cloud datacenters, to ecosystems and working with ISVs and startups, and all the way to evangelizing and teaching people how to use deep learning to revolutionize the software that they build. And we call that the Deep Learning Institute, the NVIDIA DLI. And so these are some of the high level points that I hope that you got, and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. This quarter we introduced our new family of Pascal-based GPUs, one of our most successful launches ever. We also benefited from both the winding adoption of deep learning and our expanding engagement with hyperscale datacenters around the world as they apply deep learning to all the services they provide. Revenue continued to accelerate, rising 24% to a record $1.43 billion. We saw strong sequential and year-on-year growth across our four platforms, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive. Our business model based on driving GPU compute platforms into highly targeted markets is clearly succeeding. The GPU business was up 25% to $1.2 billion from a year ago. The Tegra Processor Business increased 30% to $166 million. In Q2 our four platforms contributed nearly 89% of revenue, up from 85% a year earlier, and 87% in the preceding quarter. They collectively increased 29% year-over-year. Let's begin with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 18% year-on-year to $781 million, reflecting the success of our latest integration of Pascal-based GPUs. Demand was strong in every geographic region. The Pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances, and enables unprecedented performance and efficiencies for playing sophisticated AAA gaming titles and driving rich immersive VR experiences. In our most successful launch ever we introduced four major products. They are GeForce GTX 1080, 1070 and 1060 for the enthusiast market, and the TITAN X, the world's fastest consumer GPU for deep learning development, digital content creation and extreme gaming. WIRED magazine called the GTX 1080 an unprecedented piece of electronic precision, one that performs Herculean feats of computational strength. Forbes called GTX 1060, which brings a premium VR experience within reach of many, a fantastic product. And Hardware Canucks described TITAN X as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mind-boggling. The GTX 1080, 1070, 1060 and TITAN X are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide. VR's potential is on vivid display in a new open source game that we released during the quarter. Available on Steam, NVIDIA VR Funhouse is an open source title created with our GamesWorks SDK. It integrates physical simulation into VR along with amazing graphics and precise haptics that you feel like you're actually out at carnival. Moving to Professional Visualization, Quadro revenue grew to a record $214 million, up 22% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially. Growth came from the high-end of the market for real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations. The M6000 GPU 24 gig, launched earlier this year, is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers. Digital Domain, a leading special-effects studio, is using Quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials, which requires especially tight turnaround times. Engineering giant AECOM and the Yale School of Architecture are using Quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows. Last month at SIGGRAPH conference, we introduced a series of new products that embed photorealistic and immersive experience into workflows, incorporating Iray and VR. We launched the Pascal-based Quadro P6000, the most advanced workstation GPU, enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before. We demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster. And we launched eight new and updated software libraries such as VRWorks 360 video SDK which brings panoramic video to VR. Moving to datacenter; revenue reached a record $151 million, more than doubling year-on-year and up 6% sequentially. This impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing, hyperscale datacenters and grid virtualization. Interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology. Hyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning, both for training and real-time inference, particularly for natural lingual processing, video and image analysis. Among them are Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu. Major cloud providers are also offering GPU computing for their customers. Microsoft Azure is now using NVIDIA's GPUs to provide computing and graphics virtualization. During the quarter we began shipping Tesla P100, the world's most advanced GPU accelerator, based on the Pascal architecture. Designed to accelerate deep learning training, it allows application performance to scale up to eight GPUs using our NVLink interconnect. We also announced a variant of P100 based on PCI Express that makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers. At our GPU Technology Conference in April, we introduced DGX-1, the world's first deep learning supercomputer. Equipped with eight P100s in a single box, it provides deep learning performance that is equivalent to 250 traditional servers. It comes loaded with NVIDIA software and AI application developers. We are seeing strong interest in DGX-1 from AR researchers and developers across academia, government labs and large enterprises. Two days ago, Jen-Hsun hand-delivered the very first DGX-1 production model to the Open AI Institute. They plan to use this system in part to build autonomous agents like chatbots, cars and robots. Broader deliveries will commence later this quarter. We will be talking more about deep learning later this year at regional versions of our GPU Technology Conference set for eight cities around the world, among them, Beijing, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Seoul, as well as Washington D.C. Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than doubled in the quarter. Adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries, particularly automotive and AEC, among customers out of this quarter was Statoil, a Norwegian oil and gas company. Finally in automotive, revenue increased to a record $119 million, up 68% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially, driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars. Our effort to help partners develop self-driving cars continues to accelerate. We have started to ship our DRIVE PX 2 automotive supercomputer to the 80-plus companies using both our hardware and DriveWorks software to develop autonomous driving technologies. We remain on track to ship our autopilot solution based on the DRIVE platform. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM and IP business was $163 million, down 6% year-on-year in line with mainstream PC demand. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. We had record GAAP gross margin of 57.9%, while non-GAAP gross margin was 58.1%. These reflect the strength of our GeForce gaming GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses were $509 million, down 9% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, up 6% from a year earlier. This reflects increased hiring in R&D and marketing expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees. GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $317 million, compared to $76 million a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $382 million, up 65%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved 680 basis points from a year ago to 26.8%. Now, turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenue to be $1.68 billion plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.8% and 58% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $465 million. And GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 21% plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: And your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the datacenter business. Can you help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications, versus the classic computationally intense design applications?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Sure, Mark. Our datacenter business is comprised of three basic markets, as you're alluding to; one is high-performance computing, and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market, and very computationally intensive. Our second market is GRID, which is our datacenter virtualization, basically graphics application virtualization. You could stream and serve any PC or any PC application from datacenter to any client device. And the third application is deep learning, and this is largely our hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter, much more delightful. The vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far, and the reason for that is because high-performance computing is a relatively stable business, it's still growing business, and I expect the high-performance computing to do quite well over the coming years. GRID is a fast-growing business. I think Colette said that it was growing 100% year over-year, but it's from a much smaller base. And deep learning is not only significant in size, it's also growing quite substantially.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then last question. On the new \u2013 so you're just starting to ship Pascal now, and I guess my understanding is that, historically, as you're shipping the new product, the yields have opportunity for improvement and the more volume is shipped, the more you climb down the yield curve. What classically happens here on the yield, and does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. So we've talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years. For long-term NVIDIA followers, you might have recalled that 40-nanometer was a very challenging node for us. And then with all of these challenges it's an opportunity for us to improve our company, and we've implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology, and it starts, of course, with some of the world's best process design engineers, circuit design engineers and process readiness teams. And we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us. And the second part of it is just how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company. And so I'm really proud of the way that the company executed on Pascal. 16-nanometer FinFET is no trivial task, not to mention the speed of the memories that we used. It's the world's first G5X. We also ramped the world's first HBM2 memory and 3D memory stacking. So the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of Pascal is quite extraordinary. I'm super proud of the team. Now, going forward, we're going to continue to refine yields, and that is absolutely the case. However, we came into 16-nanometer with a great deal of preparedness, and so it's too early to guess what's going to happen to yields and margins long term, but we'll guide one quarter at a time.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong quarter. Your Q3 revenue guide implies further acceleration on a year-over-year basis. Are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth, or should we expect growth in the quarter to be broad-based?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, Toshiya. I appreciate it. We're experiencing growth in all of our businesses. Our strategy of focusing on deep learning, self-driving cars, gaming and virtual reality, these are markets where GPU makes a very significant difference, is really paying off. And I think this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses. And my expectation is that we're going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well. But it's driven by the focus on these key markets, and away from traditional commodity components businesses. I think the one particular dynamic sticks out, and it's a very significant growth driver of where we have an extraordinary position in, and it's deep learning. Deep learning, you may have heard, is a new computing approach. It's a new computing model, and requires a new computing architecture. And this is where the parallel approach of GPUs is perfectly suited. And five years ago, we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially. And we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology, from the GPU architecture to the GPU design to the systems that GPUs connect into; for example NVLink to other system software that has been designed for it, like cuDNN and DIGITS, to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company. The last five years, we've quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry, the entire computer industry that we, if you will, pushed it all in. And now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic, and it is probably \u2013 if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance, it would be deep learning.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution. Jen-Hsun, the first question is tied to PC gaming; very strong trends. I was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to Pascal, and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle, whether it's the price or what part of the stack they are buying now, and how quickly they're refreshing versus what you might have seen in the Kepler and the Maxwell cycles.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Sure. Thanks a lot, Vivek. Let's say, on PC gaming there's a few dynamics. Our installed base represents somewhere around 80 million active GeForce users around the world. And in fact, only about a third has even upgraded to Maxwell, and we only started shipping Pascal half of this last quarter. And so that gives you a sense of how much \u2013 and Pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap we've ever made generationally in GPUs ever. It is not only high-performance; it's also energy-efficient, and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for VR and others. And so I think Pascal is going to be enormously successful for us. And it comes at a time when the PC gaming marketplace is also quite different than the PC gaming market five years ago. One dynamic that's really quite powerful is that the production quality, the production content is much, much higher in video games today than ever. And the reason for that, I'd mentioned several times in previous calls, is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible, meaning that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PCs are essentially architecturally compatible. And so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations. I mean, this is a dynamic that's relatively new. And so as a result, the quality of games go up, which means that the consumption of GPU capability goes up with it. And I think we're absolutely seeing that dynamic. I'm super excited about the fact that the next-generation game console, the big boost, the 2x boost is coming just around the corner. That's going to allow game content providers, game developers to aim even higher. And I think that that's going to support long-term expansion of our gross margins and ASPs of PC gaming. I would say that there's some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well, as you know very well, which is, eSports is no longer just an interest, eSports is a full-force global phenomenon and very, very powerful in Asia, in just about every developing country, and of course the Western world as well. And I think that on top of that, not only is VR off to a great start, we're seeing some right content now, but some of the things that we introduced recently with Pascal, tapping into this grassroots, but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium, we introduced project NVIDIA Ansel which is the world's first in-game photography system. It allows you to create virtual reality photographs, and it's just really, really amazing. And so you could use your videogame, capture your amazing moments, share it in VR, or in high-res with all your friends. So there's a lot of different ways to enjoy games now, and the production value just continues to go up, which is great for our platforms. And so I think just to summarize your initial question, how much of the installed base has upgraded to Pascal; very, very small of course because we just started production ramp, but even then only a third has upgraded to Maxwell, And so there's it's a pretty large, pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun, the first one if I could on the datacenter competitive landscape, early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning, AI, and also kind of how your products are positioned from a high-end or low-end type of machine learning application performance.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Sure. Thanks. Well, as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry. We've been in this industry since the very beginning, and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of GPUs to accelerate deep learning and made it practical, made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software. The GPU was a perfect match because the nature of the GPU is a sea of small processors, not one big processor, but a whole bunch of small processors. And vitally, they're connected by this connecting tissue, this connecting tissue inside our processor, connecting memory, connecting fabric, that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously. That architectural innovation has been the source of our GPU computing initiative some 10 years ago. That invention has really been groundbreaking. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match for deep learning, where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons, communicating with each other all simultaneously. And so the GPU was really quite a perfect match. If you look at deep learning today, five years later, I think it's a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single Internet service to make them smarter, more intelligent, more delightful to consumers. And so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad, it's large-scale and it's completely global. And this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant long-term. And so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company. GPU computing is not just the GPU chip, it's GPU architecture, it's the GPU's design, it's the GPU system, all of the algorithms that run on top of it, all of the tools that run on top of it, the frameworks, our collaborations with researchers all over the world. And so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on GPUs dramatically in the last two generations. When we started this we were in Kepler. Maxwell was some 10 times better than Kepler, and Pascal is some 10 times better than Maxwell. And so in just two generations, just five years time, we've improved deep learning by an enormous amount. And a GPU today is very unlike a GPU back in the good old days because of all the work that we've done to it. Now our strategy, and this is where we're different, not only to focus on the GPU and the expertise in parallel computing, but where we're really different, I would say, is our singular architecture approach to deep learning. We've essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture. We've made this architecture available from hyperscale, to datacenters, to workstations, to notebooks, to PCs, to cars, to embedded computers, to even a brand-new fully integrated high-performance computer in a box we called DGX, the NVIDIA DGX-1. And so there's so many different ways to gain access to the NVIDIA architecture, the NVIDIA platform for deep learning. They're just literally all over the place, all around you. It's available to you in retail stores, in e-tail stores, from OEMs, in the cloud, or even in universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits. And so our approach is quite singular and quite focused. My sense is that our lead is quite substantial, and our position is very good. But we're not sitting on our laurels, as you can tell, and for the last five years we've been investing quite significantly. And so over the next several years, I think you're going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. I had a question on automotive. You mentioned that DRIVE PX is now shipping to 80 car companies. Jen-Hsun, I'm kind of curious, are the wins here sort of similar in size and focused more on prototyping, or are there opportunities here that could ultimately translate into full production wins and drive the automotive business disproportionately?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, I appreciate the question. Yeah, we've just started this quarter shipping DRIVE PX 2. And just before I answer your question, let me tell you what DRIVE PX 2 is. DRIVE PX 2, of course, is a processor. It's the DRIVE PX 2 version with just one single processor, with just Parker, and our Tegra processor, and optionally with discrete GPUs, you could literally build \u2013 you can build a car with autopilot capability, or an AI co-pilot capability, all the way to self-driving car capability. And it is able to do sensor fusion. It's able to do SLAM, which is localization and mapping, detection using deep neural nets of the environment in a surround matter, all of the cameras around the car all feeding into the processor, and the DRIVE PX processor doing real-time inferencing of surround cameras, all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car, all done in this one car computer, this one car AI supercomputer. And so this quarter we started shipping them to all of our partners and developers so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack. We have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these, and it's hard to know exactly what everybody's schedule is, but it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years. Developing a self-driving car is no \u2013 it's a fairly significant undertaking, and so nobody does it for fun, surely. And the question is, maybe if I could frame the question just slightly differently, do I expect people to be building OEM cars, or do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geofenced, do we expect them to be building trucks, and you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the world's economy is built around trucking products all over the world, to services of basically taxi as a service. The answer is that we're working with customers and partners across that entire range from cars that are sold to trucks, to vans, to shuttles, to services.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. The first is just a follow up on some of the Gaming strength in the quarter. With the company launching the Founders Edition availability of Gaming products in the quarter, can you talk about how that went, and for those products how gross margins compare to just chip bait chip bait sales that would go into a gaming card OEM?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, first of all Founders Edition, I appreciate you asking that. Founders Edition is engineered by NVIDIA, completely built by NVIDIA, and sold directly by NVIDIA and supported by NVIDIA. Now, there are some people that \u2013 some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company. Its availability is limited, and it's engineered just at the highest possible level of quality. And we limit the production of it. And the reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much, much more able to take the NVIDIA architecture to every corner of the world, literally overnight. We have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know. And they can provide them in different sizes and shapes, and styles, and different thermal solutions, and different configurations, and different price points. And so I think, we believe that, that diversity is one of the reasons why the NVIDIA GeForce platform is so popular. And it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace, and a lot of interesting, different diversified designs. And so I think those two strategies are harmonious with each other. But the key point is, we built the Founders Edition really as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us. But largely, our strategy is to go to the market with a network of partners. As for gross margins, they are marginally the same.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay.\nMatthew D. Ramsay - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to ask a couple of questions again on the datacenter business. The first being, we've done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the long-term server attach rate for accelerators in general could be, and for GPUs within that. So it'd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that. And then secondly, is there a market there for an APU-type product in the datacenter? I know you guys have Project Denver and some other things going on from the CPU perspective. But is there a deep learning integrated CPU/GPU play that might open up more TAM long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Sure. Yeah. First of all, the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed. Back in the good old days, it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much. It's no longer just about text, it's no longer just about data. The vast majority of what's going through the Internet and what's going through datacenters today, as you guys know very well, are images, there are voice, there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video. Live video, if you think about it for just a moment, it's live video, so it doesn't stay in the server, and it doesn't get recorded, which means that if you want to enjoy that live video, there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter that's running real time on their live video, so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that you're streaming knows who to alert, and who to invite to come and watch the live video. And so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward, my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput, increasingly high multimedia content, and increasingly, of course, powered by AI and powered by deep learning. And so I think that's number one. The second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably, understandably changing because the workload is changing. Deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past. And so the architecture, it's a new computing model, it recognized it needs a new computing architecture, and accelerators like GPUs are really, well, a good fit. And so now the question is, how much. It's hard to say, it's hard to say how much, but my sense is that it's going to be a lot, and without any predictions it's going to be a lot more than we currently ship. And so I think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant. I think every hyperscale datacenter will be GPU accelerated. They will be GPU accelerated for training, they will be GPU accelerated for inferencing, there may be other approaches, but I think using GPUs is going to be a very large part of that. And then lastly, APUs. I guess for datacenters, I guess my sense is for datacenters, energy efficiency is such a vital part. And although the workload is increasingly AI, and increasingly live video and multimedia where GPUs can add a lot of value, there's still a lot of workload that is GPU-centric, and you still want to have an extraordinary CPU. And I don't think anybody would argue that Intel makes the world's best CPUs. It's not even close, there's not even a close second. And so I think the artfulness of, and the craftsmanship of Intel CPUs is pretty hard to deny. And for most datacenters, I think if you have CPU workloads anyways, I think Intel Xeons are hard to beat. And so that's my opinion, anyways.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing.\nIan L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Yes. Thank you. So earlier you talked about taping out all the Pascal products at this point. I mean, are you \u2013 with three products on the market, are you ceding the sub-$250 price point for cards to competition, or is this something you can serve with older Maxwell product or some upcoming product? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, thanks a lot, Ian. We have taped out, we have verified, we have ramped, every Pascal GPU. That's right. However, we have not introduced everyone.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie.\nJ. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for the question. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on virtual reality. You guys have talked a little bit about investments there, and I was just curious what sort of reception you're getting at this point, and what's going to be in your mind the biggest driver getting that going, is it more headsets or more developers working on that? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, Steve, I think it's all of that. We have to continue to keep pushing VR, and get the head mounts out to the world. I think HTC Vive, they're doing a great job, Oculus of course are doing a great job. And so I think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there, and it's growing all the time. Second, the content is really cool, and people are really enjoying it, and so we just got to get more content, and developers all over the world are jumping on to VR. It really is a great new experience. But it's not just games as you know. One of the areas where we have a lot of success, and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and in industrial design, in medicines, medical imaging, in architectural engineering. We use it ourselves. We're doing a fair amount of design of our workspace, and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called Iray, fully accelerated by our GPUs, and then we render it into VR, and we enjoy it completely in VR. And it's something else to be inside an environment that's photorealistically rendered and completely enjoying in VR. So architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that. So we see a lot of broad-based adoption of VR. Now, one of the things that we did, which was really spectacular, is the multi-resolution, multi-projection rendering of Pascal. It's the world's first GPU architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one. And the reason for that is because the GPU back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display. You have one keyboard, you have one display. But that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types. And so multi-projection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and Pascal introduced it and you really benefit it in VR. The second thing that we did was we integrated real world physics simulation into VR. The benefit is that without the laws of physics, as you know, you can't feel anything. Things don't collide, things don't bounce. When you pick up something, you don't feel the haptics of it. We have made the entire environment physically simulated, and so as a result, you feel the entire environment. When you tip a bottle of water over, it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over, and balls behave the way balls behave, and things don't merge into each other. So that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize VR, we believe, and that physics simulation is another thing. And so I think our position in VR is really quite great, and I'm certainly enthusiastic about the development of VR.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh.\nVijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks. Just on the datacenter side, Jen-Hsun you mentioned three key segments, HPC, GRID and deep learning. What percent of mix are those for the datacenter?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: I would say, it's about half deep learning at the moment, and probably call it 35%, a third is high-performance computing, maybe more than that, and the rest of it is virtualization. And going forward, which is part of your question, my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that. The other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for Internet service providers for voice recognition, and image recognition, and face recognition and such. Deep learning is a way of using mathematics, using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data. And the one place where we regenerate a huge amount of data is high-performance computing. Every single supercomputing center in the world is going to move towards deep learning. And the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through, to sort through, and now with deep learning they can discover really, really subtle insights in data that's hyper-dimensional. And so the way to think about deep learning is really mathematics. It's a new form of mathematics that is very, very powerful. It's a new approach to software, but don't think of it as a market. I think every market is going to be a deep learning market. I think every application is going to be deep learning application, and I think software, every piece of software will be infused by AI for long-term.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. You guys had really good growth in Professional Visualization and record revenues. I would've thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family. So I was sort of pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation M6000 family, which means obviously that the Pascal demand cycle is kind of still ahead of you. Number one, is that a fair view? And then what's driving the strong adoption of M6000? And if you haven't already released it, when do you expect to launch the Pascal-based P5000 and P6000 family? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. I appreciate the question. The team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computer-aided design is done. Your observation is absolutely right, and it's coming from several different places. First of all, more and more design is really about product design, industrial design, where the feeling of the product, the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product. And whether you're talking about a building, or just a consumer product, or a car, we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations. The computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary. And we're now seeing one design package after another, whether it's Dassault's leading packages, SolidWorks leading packages, Autodesk, Adobe, the amount of GPU use has really, really increased, and it's increasing quite dramatically. I think partly because finally, for all of the ISVs, for all the developers, not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria, they can also rely on the fact that great GPUs are available in just about every computer. And so the pervasiveness of GPUs allows them to take advantage of the GPUs and to really trust that the software capabilities that they've put into their packages, if they rely on GPUs, will have the benefits of GPUs there. And so I think that, that virtuous cycle you're starting to see in design. And so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago, the GPU acceleration of optics, this layer for path-tracing that is used by just about every software package in the world, our continued evangelism of GPUs and its general purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging, is something that I think is starting to see benefits. That's number one. Number two, Maxwell was the most energy-efficient GPU ever made until Pascal. Maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of Kepler. And the amazing thing is that Pascal is twice the energy efficiency of Maxwell. But Maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs and laptops, and more elegant workstations, and the ability to put more horsepower, more capability into any workstation because of power concerns. Maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of GPU that it uses. And I think that going forward, your last question is, going forward, how do we see Pascal? Pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world, and so I think in the coming quarters we're going to expect to see Pascal out there. And my expectation is that the dynamics I just described, which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities, our invention of GPU-accelerated photorendering, Iray and OptiX, and MDL, Material Description Language, and then lastly the energy efficiency of GPUs, those three factors combined is going to be really healthy for workstations. And then last, VR. VR is coming, and in order to really enjoy the type of applications for design, you're going to need a pretty powerful GPU to support it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore.\nRoss C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Couple for you, Jen-Hsun, on the automotive side. I guess the first part would be, we've seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors, and some of your customers and we've seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve. So I wondered, how does NVIDIA play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not. And then the second part, if we put even just a rough year on it, when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Ross. Well, we play in a graceful, friendly and open way, and I mean that, I guess, rather seriously. We believe this, we believe that building a autonomous driving car, a self driving car is a pile of software, and it's really complicated software. It's really, really complicated software. And it's not like one company is going to do it. And it's also not logical that large, great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their self-driving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the self-driving car stack. We've always felt that self-driving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny. And that's the reason why DRIVE PX 2 is an OpenStack, and it's an open platform, so that every car company can build their self-driving car on top of it, number one. Number two. The DRIVE PX 2 architecture is scalable, and the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on an highway, and a virtual co-pilot and a completely autonomous self-driving car, a self-driving truck, a geofenced autonomous shuttle, a completely autonomous taxi, all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip. It's just not even logical. The computation necessary to do it is so diverse. And the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances, the more nines you would like to have, if you will, the more computation you have to do. Just as voice recognition, the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four years or five years has increased by a 100 times, but notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become. And image recognition, circumstance recognition, context recognition, all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation. And so we believe that scalable platforms is necessary. Number two. And then number three, detection. Computer vision and detection, object detection, is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem. It's just one tiny sliver. And we've always said that autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, is really an AI computing problem. It's a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection but also computation. The CPU matters, the GPU matters, the entire system architecture matters. And so the entire computation engine matters. Number two, computing is not just a chip problem, it's largely a software problem. And the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack, if you would, the operating system of a self-driving real-time supercomputer doesn't exist. Most supercomputers are best-effort supercomputers. They run a job as fast as they can until they're done. But that's not good enough for a self-driving car. This supercomputer has to run in real time and it has to react the moment it sees that there is danger in the way, and best effort doesn't cut it. You need it to be a real-time supercomputer, and the world's never built a real-time supercomputer before. And that's what DRIVE PX 2 is all about, a real-time supercomputer for surround autonomous AI. And so that's the focus that we have, that's the direction that we've taken, and I think what you're seeing is that the market is trying to react to that. But maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving that they're discovering, that the problems are related to the type of problems that we're seeing, and that's the reason why DRIVE PX is a computer, not a smart camera.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore.\nJoseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. You talked about deep learning in the hyperscale environment, but it seems like you're getting some traction as well in the enterprise environment. I know at least one IT department we've talked to has been doing some implementation. Can you talk a little bit about your progress there, and what does it take for you to sort of build that presence within more traditional enterprises?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, as you know, deep learning is not just an Internet service approach. Deep learning is really machine learning supercharged, and deep learning is really about discovering insight in big data, in big unstructured data, in multi-dimensional data. And that's what deep learning \u2013 that's the \u2013 I've called it, it's Thor's hammer that fell from the sky, and it's amazing technology that these researchers discovered. And we were incredibly, incredibly well prepared because GPUs is naturally parallel, and we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution. But when you think about it in the context that it's just \u2013 it's software development, it's a new method of doing software and it's a new way of discovering insight from data. What company wouldn't need it? So every life sciences company needs it, every healthcare company needs it, every energy discovery company needs it, every e-tail, retail company needs it. Everybody has lots of data, everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves. Every manufacturing company needs it, every company that cares about security, every company that deals with the massive amount of customer data has the benefit of \u2013 can benefit from deep learning. So when you frame it in that context, I think I would say that deep learning's market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer Internet services. And that's exactly the reason why we built the NVIDIA DGX-1 because most of these enterprises don't have the expertise, or simply don't have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or high-performance computer. They would just rather buy an appliance, if you will, with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned, and it comes out of a box. And that's essentially what NVIDIA DGX-1 is. It's a supercomputer in a box, and it's designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava.\nAmbrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. I had a question, just one question on gross margin Jen-Hsun. Very big top line guidance, but yet gross margin is guided to flat. What is the reason? And I understand it's not always perfectly correlated, margin should be going up that much, but is it pricing, is it yield, because the mix also seems to be moving in the right direction, more ProVis, more HPC and less of the OEM business.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, our guidance is our best estimate, and we'll know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again. But at some high level, I would agree with you that as we move further and further, and more and more into our platform approach of business, where our platform is specialized and rich with software, that increasingly the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value, that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second, but real TCO for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters, and real increases and real boosts in their productivity. And so I think there's every reason to believe that long-term this platform approach can derive a greater value. But as for the next quarter, I think let's just wait and see how it goes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill.\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Rajvindra, how are you?\nRajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Sir, exactly. Good. A question, Jen-Hsun, on the DRIVE PX 2, so my understanding as you described it, it's one scalable architecture from the cockpit to ADAS, to mapping, to autonomous driving. But I'm curious to see how that kind of compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing, I guess, different solutions for different levels of the ADAS systems, whether it's level 1, level 2, level 3, specifically with the V2X communication where for level 4 autonomous driving you're going to need six to 20 different radar units, three to six different cameras, LiDAR. I'm just trying to square how your approach is different from some of your competitors in the semiconductor space.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. Good question. There's no way to square and there's no reason to square, and you're not going to find one answer. And the reason why you're not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done. We all have intuitions and we all have beliefs about how we're going to be able to ultimately solve the long-term, fully autonomous vehicle, that wherever I am, the car I step into, the automobile we step into is completely autonomous, and it has AI inside and out. And it's just an incredible experience. But we're not there yet. And all of these companies have slightly \u2013 not all but many companies have slightly different visions of the future. Some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geofenced area that has been fully mapped in advance. Some people believe that you can use it just for highway autopilot as a first starting point, and work quickly towards fully autonomy. Some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks. So you see a lot of different visions out there. And I think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things, and they're targeting different aspects of transportation. I think there's a fallacy that transportation in every single country, in every single form is exactly the same. It just doesn't work that way. And so there's technology insight and then there's market insight, and there's a technology vision versus your entry point. And I think that's where all of the squaring doesn't happen. And so you're solving for problems that \u2013 you're solving for a simple equation that won't happen. However, there's one thing that we believe absolutely will happen. We are absolutely certain that AI is going to be involved in this endeavor, that finally with deep learning and finally with AI that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles, and to solve these puzzles over the period of time; number one. Number two, we believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve, you need a different amount of computational capability. We believe unambiguously this is a software problem, and that for the largest of transportation companies, they need to own their own \u2013 they're going to need \u2013 own their own software in collaboration with you, but they're not going to let you do it and keep it as a black box. We believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem, that this is a real-time supercomputing problem; that it's not just about a special widget, but computation is necessary. Processors, a computer system, system software, enormous amount of operating system capability, is necessary to build something like this. It is a massive software problem. Otherwise, we would have done it already. And so I think that you're going to see this year the beginnings of a lot of those, of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions. But in the next year and the year after that, I think you're going to see more and more and more. I think this is the beginning, and we're working with some really, really amazing people to get this done.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, guys. So just kind of circling back to the datacenter piece and the deep learning aspect. Is there a change in ASPs you guys are seeing when you enter that market?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: No.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So essentially, there's going to be no margin change from the datacenter sales, and I guess the same question in automotive as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Automotive ASPs for self-driving cars will be much higher than infotainment. It's a much tougher problem. Every car in the world has infotainment. With the exception of some pioneering work or early \u2013 the best, the most leading-edge cars today, almost no cars are self-driving. And so I think that the technology necessary for self-driving cars is much, much more complicated than lane keeping, or adaptive cruise control, or first-generation and second-generation ADAS. The problem is much, much more complicated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Alger.\nBrian Alger - ROTH Capital Partners LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I think this will be the first congrats actually on a pretty darn good quarter and amazing guidance. I want to come back to the difference of Pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from either Intel or AMD. There's been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between Pascal versus Polaris. And one would think that while that's important in gaming, and it's gotten a lot of notice, it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that we've been talking so much about over the past half hour or 45 minutes. Can you maybe talk to that side of the design, not so much the horsepower, but maybe the power efficiency of it, and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, Brian. Thank you very much. First of all, I appreciate the comment. The team worked really, really hard, and over the last several years \u2013 the last five years, all of the employees of NVIDIA have been pursuing a strategy that took until today really to show people that it really pays off. And it's a very unique business model. It's a very unique approach, but I just want to congratulate all the employees that have worked so hard to get us here. I appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward. And the reason for that is because every single environment that we're in is power-constrained; every single environment. Even your PC with 750 watts or 1,000 watts is power-constrained, because we can surely put more GPUs in there than 1000 watts. And so that's power-constrained. We're in environments where we only have one or two watts. It might be a drone. And we need to be \u2013 we're completely power-constrained so energy efficiency is really important. We might be in a datacenter where we're doing deep learning and we're training neural nets or we're inferencing neural nets. And in this particular case, although the datacenter has a lot of power to provision, the number of GPUs that they want to use in it is measured in tens, tens and tens of thousands. And so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue. Energy efficiency literally is the most important feature of the processor. Now, from there, their functionality and architectural features. The architectural changes that we've made in Pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress was groundbreaking. And people were starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into Pascal, and it's going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning, and so that's a feature in architectural innovation. And then lastly of course, there's all of the software that goes on top of processor (01:12:03); we call it GPU computing instead of just GPUs because GPU computing is about computing. It's about software. It's about systems. It's about the interrelationship of our GPU with the memories and all the memories around the system and the networking and the interconnect and storage, and it's a large-scale computing problem. It is also the highest throughput computing problem on the planet, which is the reason why we've been called upon by our nation to build the world's next two fastest supercomputers. High-throughput computing is our company's expertise. High-throughput computing, from fundamental architecture to chip design to system design to system software to algorithms to computational mathematics, and all the experts in all the various fields of science, that is the great investment that we made in the last five years and I think the results are really starting to show.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and great execution on the quarter. Two related questions. One, I just \u2013 Colette, I was just curious, your view on the return \u2013 use of capital and buybacks obviously an accelerated one, only $9 million in the last quarter. What's your view going forward? And then Jen-Hsun, maybe a bigger question in terms of use of capital, whether you could talk about \u2013 you said CPU is not an area that you would want to go into, but obviously GPUs have legs. I was just curious if you have to look around at other areas, maybe in the datacenter where you could also add value?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Blayne. The return of capital continues to be an important part of our shareholder value message, but remember, it is still two parts of it. Part of it is still dividends and part of it has been our purchasing of stock. So as we continue to go forward, the dividend is definitely a long-term perspective and we'll make sure that we can watch the dividend yield there to stay competitive and also looking at our profitability. Our share repurchase, we'll look at the opportunistic time for those repurchases and making sure that we're also doing that carefully as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: And long-term use of capital, I would say this that, you know what NVIDIA is really rich with is we're rich with vision and creativity and the courage to innovate and that's one of the reasons why we start almost every conversation with anything by gathering our great people around the company and seeing what kind of future we can invent for ourselves and for the world. And so I think our use of capital is nurturing the employees that we have and providing them a platform to innovate and create new conditions by which they can be successful and do their life's work. And so that's philosophically where we start. We're not allergic to acquisitions and purchases and we look all the time and we have the benefit of working with and partnering with companies, large and small, all over the world as we move the industry forward. And so we're surely open to that, but our natural posture is always to invest in our people and invest in our own company's ability to invent the future.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, thank you for breaking out deep learning as a percentage of the datacenter. Can you provide what that percentage was for the April quarter? And then the follow-up question is, I look back over the last four quarters and I look at your implied guide, you're looking at roughly 50% incremental operating margin. I'm curious if that's the right kind of number you would underwrite here? Or should we be thinking about improving mix as well as maturing process and manufacturing at your foundry partners such that that could actually be higher as we look ahead? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Deep learning is a software approach, a new computing architecture, a new computing approach that the industry, that researchers have been developing for 20 years. And it was only until five years ago when pioneering work was on deep learning on GPUs that really turbocharged it and gave the industry, if you will, a time machine that brought the future to the present. And the power of deep learning is so great that this capability is expanding and people are discovering more ways to use it and more applications, and new deep learning architectures. And the networks are getting bigger and deeper and more complicated. And so, I think that this area is going to grow quite significantly. It represents a vast majority of our datacenter revenues recently and my sense is that it's going to continue to be a significant part of it. And so \u2013 what was the second question? Did I miss it? I think that his question was really about datacenters and deep learning, right?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think your question was regarding deep learning and the percentage of datacenter and how that has moved?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. And it's vast majority. Roughly its vast majority.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy.\nKevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I go to the other end of the spectrum and speaking of energy efficiency, are you finding new opportunities for Tegra aside from the infotainment in automotive?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Kevin, I appreciate the question. Tegra is at the core of all of our self-driving car initiatives. And so without Tegra, there would be no self-driving cars. And so Tegra is the core of our self-driving car initiative. It is the computing platform for self-driving cars and DRIVE PX 2 includes Tegra as well as discrete GPUs of Pascal, but the core of it, the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by Tegra and we expect that going forward. And so Tegra is incredibly important to us. Tegra is also the core of the processor of Jetson. Jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines and so you can imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future would benefit from deep learning and AI, but robots and drones and embedded applications and embedded applications inside buildings and cities, there're all kinds of applications. I'm very, very optimistic about the future of Jetson, but at the core of that is also Tegra. And so think of Tegra as our computer on a chip and it's our AI computer on a chip.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Okay. May I? I appreciate all the questions. Thank you all for joining us today. Our growth is really driven by several factors. Our focus on deep learning, self-driving cars, Gaming and VR, markets where GPU has been vital is really starting to pay off. The second factor is that Pascal is the most advanced GPU ever created and we're incredibly excited about it and this last quarter we ramped it with enormous success and I'm so proud of the team for all of the preparation and the executions last quarter. And the third is hyperscale adoption of deep learning is now widespread, is large-scale and we're seeing it globally. Those are several growth drivers ahead of us. As we go forward, we're also looking to sharing our many developments in deep learning AI with you. We're really just in the beginning of seeing the actual growth of deep learning as we scale out into the market. Deep learning adoption is now widespread and is ramping at every hyperscale datacenter. It's a new computing model. It requires a new computing architecture, one that GPU is perfectly suited for, and the thing that we've done that I'm really delighted with is the strategy that started five years ago to optimize our GPU computing platform from end-to-end and optimize it for deep learning at the processor level, at the architecture level, at the chip design level, systems and software and algorithms and a richness of deep learning experts at the company and the collaboration that we have all over the world with researchers and developers has made it possible for us to continue to advance this field in this platform. And as a result of that, our deep learning platform has improved far more than anybody would've expected. If you just projected it based on semiconductor physics, it would be nowhere near the level of speed up and step up that we got from generation to generation, from Kepler to Maxwell we got 10X, from Maxwell to Pascal we got another 10X and you can surely expect pretty substantial improvements and increases from us over the next several years. Where we really shine is not only as a fantastic platform for deep learning and the training of the networks but it's also a fantastic platform to scale out. You can enjoy our platform whether it's in cloud or in datacenter or in supercomputers and workstations and desk site PCs and notebook computers to cars to embedded computers, as I mentioned just now with Jetson. This is a one singular architecture approach. So the thoughtfulness and the care of the investment of the developers and the software programmers and researchers is really our preeminent concern. And as we know, computing is about architecture and computing is about platform and mostly computing is about developers. And we've been quite thoughtful about the importance it is to developers. And as a result, developers all over the world, all over the industry can use the singular architecture and get the benefits of their science and their applications as they scale and deploy their work. So that's it. We had a great quarter and I look forward to reporting our progress next quarter. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Arnab. In March we introduced our newest GPU architecture, Pascal. This extraordinary scalable design built on the 16-nanometer FinFET process provides massive performance and exceptional power efficiency. It will enable us to extend our leadership across our four specialized platforms: gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive. Year-on-year revenue growth continued to accelerate, increasing 13% to $1.3 billion. Our GPU business grew 15% to $1.08 billion from a year ago. Tegra processor business was up 10% to $160 million. Growth continues to be broad-based across all four platforms. Record performance in datacenter was driven by the adoption of deep learning across multiple industries. In Q1 our four platforms contributed nearly 87% of revenue, up from 81% a year earlier. They collectively increased 21% year over year. Let's start out with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue increased 17% year on year to $687 million, momentum carried forward from the holiday season helped by the continued strength of Maxwell-based GTX processors. Last weekend at DreamHack Austin, we unveiled GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, our first Pascal GPUs for gamers. They represent a quantum leap for gaming and immersive VR experiences, delivering the biggest performance games from the previous generation architect in a decade. Media reports and gamers have been unanimously enthusiastic. The Verge wrote, what NVIDIA is doing with its new GTX 1000 series is bringing yesteryear's insane high-ends into 2016's mainstream. We also extended our VR platform by adding spatial acoustics to our VRWorks software development kit, which helps provide an even greater sense of presence within VR. We introduced simultaneous multi-projection, enabling accurate, efficient projection of the real world to surround monitors, VR headsets as well as feature displays. To showcase these technologies, we created our own amazing Open Source game called NVIDIA VR Funhouse, available on Steam. In addition, we announced Ansel, an in-game photography system which enables gamers to capture high resolution and VR scenes within their favorite games. Moving to professional visualization. Quadro grew year on year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue rose 4% to $189 million. Growth came from higher-end products and mobile workstations. We launched the M6000 24GB and are seeing good success among multiple customers including Toyota and Pixar. Roche is using the M6000 to speed its DNA sequencing pipeline by 8X, enabling more affordable genetic testing. We see exciting opportunities for our Quadro platform with virtual reality and NVIDIA Iray, a photo-realistic rendering tool that enables designers effectively to walk around their creations and make real-time adjustments. Moving to datacenter. Revenue was a record $143 million, up 63% year on year and up 47% sequentially, reflecting enormous growth in deep learning. In just a few years, deep learning has moved from academia and is now being adopted across the hyperscale landscape. We expect growing deployment in the coming year among large enterprises. GPUs have become the accelerator of choice for hyperscale center centers due to their superior programmability, computational performance, and power efficiency. Our Tesla M4 is over 50% more power efficient than other programmable accelerators for applications such as real-time image classification for AlexNet, a deep learning framework. Hyperscale companies are the fastest adopters of deep learning, accelerating their growth in our Tesla business. Starting from infancy three years ago, hyperscale revenue is now similar to that from high performance computing. NVIDIA GPUs today accelerate every major deep learning framework in the world. We power IBM Watson and Facebook's Big Sur server for AI, and we're in AI platforms at hyperscale giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu for both training and real-time inference. Twitter has recently said they use NVIDIA GPUs to help users discover the right content among the millions of images and videos shared every day. During the quarter, we hosted our seventh annual GPU Technology Conference. The event drew record attendance with 5,500 scientists, engineers, designers and others across a wide range of fields, and featured 600 sessions and 200 exhibitors. At GTC we unveiled the Tesla P100, the world's advanced GPU accelerator based on the Pascal architecture. The P100 utilizes a combination of technologies including NVLink, a high speed interconnect allowing application performance to scale on multiple GPUs, high memory bandwidth, and multiple hardware features designed to natively accelerate AI applications. The next platform, an enterprise IT site, calls it a beast in all the good sense of that word. Among the first customers for our Pascal accelerator is the Swiss national computer center, which will use it to double the speed of Europe's fastest supercomputer. At GTC, we also announced the DGX-1, the world's first deep learning supercomputer loaded. With eight P100s in a single box interconnected with NVLink, it provides the deep learning performance equivalent to 250 traditional servers. DGX-1 comes loaded with a suite of software designed to aid AI and application developers. Universities, hyperscale vendors, and large enterprises developing AI-based applications are showing strong interest in the system. Among the first to get DGX-1 will be the Massachusetts General Hospital. It launched an initiative that applies AI techniques to improve the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and management of diseases, drawing on its database of some 10 billion medical images. In our GRID graphics virtualization business, we're seeing interest across a variety of industries ranging from manufacturing, energy, education, government, and financial services. Finally, in automotive, revenue continued to grow, reaching $113 million, up 47% year-over-year and up 22% sequentially, reflecting the growing popularity of premium infotainment features in mainstream cars. NVIDIA's working closely with partners to develop self-driving cars using our end-to-end platform, which starts with Tesla in the datacenter and extends through the deployment with DRIVE PX 2. Since we unveiled DRIVE PX 2 earlier this year, worldwide interest has continued to grow among car makers, Tier 1 suppliers, and others. We are now collaborating with more than 80 companies using the open architecture of DRIVE PX to develop their own software and driving experiences. At GTC, we demonstrated the world's first self-driving car trained using deep learning and showed its ability to navigate on roads without lane markings even in bad weather. Additionally, we announced that DRIVE PX 2 will serve as the brain behind the new ROBORACE initiative in the Formula E racing circuit. The circuit will include 10 teams racing identical cars, all using DRIVE PX 2. Beyond our four platforms, our OEM, IP business was $173 million, down 21% year-on-year, reflecting weak PC demand. Now, turning to the rest of the income statement. We had record GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter at 57.5% and 58.6%, respectively. Driving these margins was the strength of our Maxwell GPUs, the success of our platform approach, and strong demand for deep learning. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $506 million and declined from $539 million in Q4 on lower restructuring charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $443 million, flat sequentially and up 4% from a year earlier, reflecting increased hiring for our growth initiatives and development-related expenses associated with Pascal. GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $245 million, up 39% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income was $322 million, also up 39%. Non-GAAP operating margins improved more than 470 basis points from a year ago to 24.7%. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $196 million. Non-GAAP net income was $263 million, up 41%, fueled by the strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. During the first quarter, we'd entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement, and paid $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we've returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders. This represents over 100% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013 through this Q1. For fiscal 2017, we intend to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. Now, turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenue to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 57.7% and 58.0%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $500 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $445 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 are both expected to be 20%, plus or minus 1%. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question, and good job on the results and the guidance. Maybe as my first one, Jen-Hsun, how do you assess the competitive landscape in PC gaming? AMD recently claimed to be taking a lot of share, and they're launching Polaris soon. Just if you could walk us through what does NVIDIA do better than AMD? So \u2013 that helps you maintain your competitive edge in this market, and what impact will Pascal have in that?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, Vivek, thank you. Our PC gaming platform, GeForce, is strong and getting stronger than ever, and I think the reason for that is several, several folds. First of all, our GPU architecture is just superior. We dedicated an enormous amount of effort to advancing our GPU architecture. I think the engineering of NVIDIA is exquisite, and our craftsmanship is really unrivaled anywhere. The scale of our company in building GPUs is the highest and the largest of any company in the world. This is what we do. This is the one job that we do. And so, it's not surprising to me that NVIDIA's GPU technology is further ahead than any time in its history. The second thing, however, it's just so much more than just chips anymore, as you know. Over the last 10 years, we've started to evolve our company to much more of a platform company, and it's about developing all the algorithms that sit on top of our GPUs. A GPU is a general purpose processor. It's a general purpose processor that's dedicated to a particular field of computing, such as computer graphics here, physics simulation, et cetera. But the thing that's really important is all of the algorithms that sit on top of it, and we have a really, really fantastic team of computational mathematicians that captures our algorithms and our know-how into GameWorks, into the physics engine, and recently the really amazing work that we're doing in VR that we've embodied into VRWorks. And then lastly, it's about making sure that the experience always just works. We have a huge investment in working with game developers all over the world from the moment that the game is being conceived of, all the way to the point that it's launched. And we optimize the games on our platform, we make sure that our drivers work perfectly, and even before a gamer downloads or buys a particular game, we've already updated their software so that it works perfectly when they install the game, and we call that GFE, the GeForce Experience. And so, Vivek, it's really about a top-to-bottom approach, and I haven't even started talking about all of the marketing work that we do in engaging the developers and engaging the gamers all over the world. This is really a network platform and all of our platform partners that take it \u2013 take our platform to market. And so it's a pretty extensive network and it's a pretty extensive platform and it's so much more than chips anymore.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you, Jen-Hsun. And as my follow-up, so it seems like datacenter products were the big upside surprise in Q1, grew over 60% from last year. Could you give us some more color on what drove that upside? Was it the initial Pascal launch? Is that impact still to come? And just broadly, what trends are you seeing there in HPC versus cloud versus some of these new AI projects that you're involved with?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, thanks. You know that I've been rather enthusiastic about high performance computing for some time. And we've been evolving our GPU platform so that it's better at general purpose computing than ever. And almost every single datacenter in the world and every single server company in the world are working with us to build servers that are based on GPUs, based on NVIDIA GPUs for high performance computing. One of the most important areas of high performance computing has been this area called deep learning. And this deep learning \u2013 deep learning, as you know, as you probably are starting to hear, is a brand-new computing model that takes advantage of the massively parallel processing capability of a GPU along with the big data that many companies have to essentially have software write algorithms by itself. Deep learning is a very important field of machine learning, and machine learning is now in the process of revolutionizing artificial intelligence making machines more and more intelligent and using it to discover insight that, quite frankly, isn't possible otherwise. And so this particular field is \u2013 was first adopted by hyperscale companies so that they could find insight and make recommendations and make predictions from the billions of customer transactions they have every day. Now, it's in the process of moving into enterprises, but in the meantime, hyperscale companies are now in the process of deploying our GPUs in deep learning applications into production. And so we've been talking about this area for some time, and now we're starting to see the broad deployment in production, so we're quite excited about that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. First question, the growth in the Tesla business is impressive. And looking back, it seemed like that business actually decelerated in 2015, which was a headscratcher for me. And I wonder, do you think that the \u2013 your customers in that business paused in anticipation of Pascal, or do you think it's the AI apps and deep learning applications that are just hitting their stride right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, decelerating, I guess I'm not sure I recall that. The thing, though, about HPC, about GPU computing is as you know, this is a new computing model, and we've been promoting this computing model now for close to seven years. And a new computing model doesn't come along very frequently. In fact, as I know it, I don't know if there's a new computing model that's used anywhere that has been revolutionary in the last 20 years. And so GPU computing took some time to develop. We've been evangelizing it for quite some time. We developed robust tools, so that make it easier for people to take advantage of our GPUs. We have industry expertise in a large number of industries now. We have APIs that we've created for each one of the industries. We've been working with the ecosystem in each one of the industries and developers in each one of the industries, and as of this time, we have quite a large handful, quite a large number of industries that we accelerate applications for. And so I think that \u2013 I guess my recommendation \u2013 my recollection would be that it has taken a long time, in fact, to have made GPU computing into a major new computing model. But I think at this point, it is pretty clear that it's going mainstream. It is really one of the best ways to achieve the post-Moore's Law era of computing acceleration. And it's been adopted by (23:19) complications. And the one that \u2013 of course, that is a very, very big deal is deep learning and machine learning. This particular field is a brand new way of doing computing for a large number of companies and we're seeing traction all over the place.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please proceed.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Jen-Hsun or Colette, first of all, I wanted to see if you could help provide some color on some of the drivers of growth for fiscal 2Q, whether most of it's coming from Pascal possibly, in the gaming market or in the Tesla products, or if there's also some of that growth in Tegra automotive as well for fiscal 2Q.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, Stephen. I would expect that all of our businesses grow in Q2. And so it's across the board. We're seeing great traction in gaming. Gaming, as you know, has multiple growth drivers. Partly the gaming is growing because the production value of games is growing, partly because the number of people who are playing is growing. eSports is more popular than ever. Sports spectatorship is more popular than ever. And so gaming is just a larger and larger market, and it's surprising everybody. And the quality of games is going up, which means that (24:50) to go up. High performance computing has grown, and the killer app is machine learning and deep learning. And that's going to continue to go in production from the hyperscale companies as we expand our reach into enterprises all over the world now, companies who have a great deal of data that they would like to point insight in. Automotive is growing and we're delighted to see that the enterprise is growing as well.\nStephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great. And as I follow up for Colette, on the gross margin side of things, you guys were guiding margins up nicely for the quarter. And just kind of wondering, looking out further across the year, whether or not the levers that you have available to you currently, if there's further room for expansion, whether it's from product mix, higher ASPs, and/or maybe even some of the platform-related elements such as software services. Just kind of wondering, especially on the software side, how much that can continue to help margins from a platform perspective.\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks, Stephen. Yes, our gross margins within the quarter for Q1 did hit record levels just due to very strong mix across our products on the Maxwell side both from a gaming perspective as well as what we have in enterprise for pro visualization and datacenter. As we look to Q2, a good review of where we also see gross margins and those are looking at a non-GAAP at about 58%. Mix will again be a strong component of that as our launch of Pascal will come out with high-end gaming and with datacenter, and the growth essentially across all of our platforms will help our overall gross margins. As we go forward, there's still continued work to do. We're here to guide just one quarter out but we do have a large TAM in front of us on many of these different markets, and the mix will certainly help us. We're in the initial stages of rolling out what we have in software services on our overall systems, so don't expect it to be a material part of the overall gross margin but it will definitely be a great value proposition for us for what we put forth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nDeepon Nag - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys, and congratulations on the great quarter. For Q2, could you kind of talk about how much the contribution you expect from Pascal and also maybe give us an update on where you think yield is progressing right now?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Deepon. We're expecting a lot of Pascal. Pascal was just announced for 1080 and 1070, and both of those products are in full production. We're in production with Tesla P100, and so all of our Pascal products that we've announced are in full production, so we're expecting a lot. Yields are good. And building these semiconductor devices are always hard, but we're very good at it. And this is now a year behind when the first 16-nanometer FinFET products went into production in TSMC. They have yields under great control. TSMC is the world's best manufacturer of semiconductors, and we work very closely with them to make sure that we're ready for production, and we surely wouldn't have announced it if we didn't have manufacturing under control. So we're in great shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTing Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Gabriel calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking the question. When you recently launched the new GTX GPU product, it looks like your pricing, your MS obviously appears to be higher than your prior generation, and how should we think about your ASP on an even gross margin trend, if you're ramping this product for the rest of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, thanks. The thing that's most important is that the value's greater than ever, and one of the things that we know is games are becoming richer than ever. The production values become richer than ever. And gamers want to play these games with all of the settings maxed out. They would like to play at a very high resolution. They want to play it at very high frame rates. When I announced the 1080, I was showing all of the latest and most demanding games running at twice the resolution of a game console, at twice the frame rate of a game console, and it was barely even breathing hard. And so I think one of the most important things is for customers of this segment, they want to buy a product that they can count on and that they can rely on to be ready for future-generation games. And some of the most important future generation games are going be in VR. And so, the resolution's going to be even higher, the frame rate expectation is 90 hertz, and the latency has to be incredibly low so that you feel a sense of presence. And so, I think the net of it all is that the value proposition we delivered with 1080 and 1070 is just through the roof. And if you look at the early response on the web and from analysts, they're quite excited about the value proposition that we brought.\nOperator: And our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions around the datacenter. I guess first part, how's the visibility here today? And I guess how do you see perhaps the transition from hyperscale to a ramp in HPC? And then I know you guys don't like to forecast over the next couple quarters, but looking out over the next 12 months to 24 months, this part of your business has grown from 8% to 11% year-over-year. And, curious, as you look at one year to two years, what do you think this could be as a percentage of your overall company? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, C.J., thanks a lot. I think a lot \u2013 the answer to a lot of your questions is I don't know. However, there are some things I do know very well. One of the things that we do know is that high-performance computing is an essential and central approach for one of the most important computing models that we know today, which is machine learning and deep learning. Hyperscale datacenters all over the world is relying on this new model of computing, so that it could harvest, it could study all of the vast amounts of data that they're getting to find insight for individual customers to make the perfect recommendation, predict what somebody would anticipate \u2013 would look forward to, in terms of news or products, or whatever it is. And so this approach of using computing is really unprecedented. And this is a new computing model, and the GPU is really ideal for it. And we've been working on this for \u2013 coming up on a decade, and it explains one of the reasons why we have such a great lead in this particular aspect. The GPU is really the ideal processor for these massively parallel problems, and we've optimized our entire stack of platforms, from the architecture to the design, to the system, to the middleware, to the system software, all the way to the work that we do with developers all over the world, so that we can optimize the entire experience to deliver the best performance. And so this is something that's taken a long time to do. I've a great deal of confidence that machine learning is not a fad. I've a great deal of confidence that machine learning is going be the future computing model for a lot of very large and complicated problems, and I think that all of the stories that you see, whether it's the groundbreaking work that's done at Google and Google DeepMind on AlphaGo, to self-driving cars, to the work that people are talking about and artificial intelligence recommendation chatbots to \u2013 boy, the list just goes on and on. And I think that it goes without saying that this new computing model in the last couple of years has really started to deliver very, very promising results. And I would characterize the results as being superhuman results. And now they're going into production, and we're seeing production deployments not just in one or two customers but basically in every single hyperscale datacenter in the world in every single country. And so, I think this is a very, very big deal. And I don't think it's a short-term phenomenon. And the amount of data that we process is just going to grow. And so, those are some of the things I do know.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Thanks for cycling me back in for a follow-up. Sometimes when you introduce a new product, and this is probably for technology, there's kind of a hiccup as the transition happens where the supply chain blows out the older inventory before the new products can ramp in, so people call that an air pocket. So, I was wondering, is that something that you can manage? How do you try to manage that? Did you account for it when you think about the outlook for this quarter? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, thanks, Mark. Well, product transitions are always tricky, and we take it very seriously. And there's several things that we do know. We have a great deal of visibility to the channel and so we know how much inventory is where and of which kind. And secondarily, we have perfect visibility into our supply chain. And both of those matters need to be taken into account when we launch a new product. And so, anything could happen. The fact of the matter is we are in a high-tech business, and high-tech is hard. The work that we do is hard. The team doesn't take it for granted and we're not complacent about our work. And so, I think that I can't imagine a better team in the world that is to manage this transition. We've managed transitions all the time. And so we don't take it lightly. However, you're absolutely right. I mean, it requires care and the only thing I can tell you is that we're very careful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJoe L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I guess along the same lines, can you talk a little bit about the Founders Edition of the new gaming products? Is that different from previous reference designs that you've done? Is there any difference in economics to NVIDIA if you sell Founders Edition?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: The Founders Edition is something we did as a result of demand from the end user base. The Founders Edition is basically designed by \u2013 wholly designed by NVIDIA product. A reference design is really not designed to be an end product. It's really designed to be a reference for manufacturers to use as a starting point. But the Founders Edition is designed so that it could be manufactured, it could be marketed, and customers can continue to buy it from us for as long as they desire. Now, our strategy is to support our global network of add-in card partners and we'll continue do that. We gave them \u2013 we gave everybody reference designs like we did before. And in this particular case, we created the Founders Edition so that people who like to buy directly from us, people who like our industrial design, and people who would like the exquisite design and quality that comes with our products that we can do. And so it's designed to be extremely overclockable. It's designed with all the best possible components. And if somebody would like to buy products directly from us, they have the ability to do that. I expect that the vast majority of the add-in cards will continue to be manufactured by our add-in card partners, and that's our expectation and that's our hope. And I don't expect any dramatic change in the amount of shifting of that. So that's basically it. Founders Edition, the most exquisitely engineered add-in card the world's ever seen, directly from NVIDIA.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, and solid job on the execution. At the recent analyst day, I think the team articulated its exposure to developed and emerging markets, and the unit and ASP growth opportunities around EM. Just wondering what are the current demand dynamics that you're seeing in emerging markets? Clearly, I think macro-wise they're still pretty weak but, on the flip side, gaming has shown to be fairly macro-insensitive. Would be great to get your views here.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: I think you just said it. Depending on which one of our businesses that you're talking about, gaming is rather macro-insensitive for some reason. People enjoy gaming. Whether the economy is good or not, whether the oil price is high or not, people seem to enjoy gaming. Don't forget gaming is not something that people do once a month, like going out to a movie theater or something like that. People game every day, and the gamers that use our products are gaming every day. It's their way of engaging with their friends. They hang out with their friends that way. It's platform for chatting. Don't forget that the number one messaging company in China is actually a gaming company. And the reason for that is because while people are gaming, they're hanging out with their friends and they're chatting with their friends. And so it's really a medium for all kinds of things, whether it's entertaining or hanging out or expressing your artistic capabilities or whatnot. And so gaming, for one, appears to be doing quite well in all aspects of the market. The second thing is enterprise, however, is largely \u2013 or hyperscale is largely a U.S. dynamic. And the reason for that is because \u2013 U.S. dynamic as well as a China dynamic \u2013 because that's where most of the world's hyperscale companies happen to be. And then automotive, most of our automotive success to date has been from the European car companies, and we're seeing robust demand from the premium segments of the marketplace. However, in the future, we're going see a lot more success with automotive here in the United States, here in Silicon Valley. In China we're going to see a lot more global penetration because of our self-driving car platform.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nIan L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC: Yes. Thank you. So for July, it looks like you've got some operating expense discipline. Given some hiring activity in April, you're down sequentially. Is that related to the timing of some tape-out activity? And as Pascal rolls out, what should the shape of the tape-outs be, do you think, for the upcoming quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, all of the Pascal chips have been taped out. But we still have a lot of engineering work do. The differences are minor. We're a large company and we have a lot of things that we're doing. I wouldn't overstudy the small deltas in OpEx. We don't manage things a dollar at a time, and we're trying invest in the important things. On the other hand, this company is really, really good about not wasting money. And so we want to make sure that on the one hand we invest into opportunities that are very important to our company, but we just have a culture of frugality that permeates our company. And then lastly, from an operational perspective, we've unified everything in our company behind one architecture. And whether you're talking about the cloud or workstations or datacenters or PCs or cars or embedded systems or autonomous machines, you name it, everything is exactly one architecture. And the benefit of one architecture is that we can leverage one common stack of software. And that base software, it really streamlines our execution. And so it's an incredibly efficient approach for leveraging our one architecture into multiple markets. So those three aspects of how we run the company really helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice results. Just curious. Two questions. Jen-Hsun, you talked about the ramp of deep learning and you kind of talked about that you're going use GPUs for both learning as well as applying the inferences. Just curious, what stages \u2013 you mentioned all these customers. What stages are all these customers? Are they actually deploying it in volume? Are they still more your sales for learning? And then you said all segments up. Just curious, OEMs finally hitting some easy compares. Is that also going be up year-over-year?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: I think (43:42)\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The OEM business will not be up year-over-year.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: I think OEM business is down year-over-year, isn't it?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. And so on Q2, we'll probably follow along in Q2 along with overall PC demand, which is not expected to grow. So we'll look at that as our side product and probably would not be a growth business in Q2.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yeah, so, Blayne, you know that our OEM business is a declining part of our company's overall business, and not to mention that the margins are also significantly below the corporate average. And so that would suggest that it's just increasingly less important part of the way that we go to market. Now, what I don't mean by that is that we don't partner with the world's large OEMs. HP, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Lenovo, all of the world's large enterprise companies are our partners. We partner with them to take our platforms, our differentiated platforms, our specialty platforms to the world's markets, and most of them are related to enterprise. We just do less and less volume, high-volume components devices. Generic devices like cell phones that we got out of, generic PCs that we've gotten out of, largely we tend not to do business like that anymore. We intend to focus on our differentiated platforms. Now, you mentioned learning and training and inferencing. First of all, training is production. You can't train a network just once. You have to train your network all the time. And every single hyperscale company in the world is in the process of scaling out their training because the networks are getting bigger. They want their networks to do even better. The difference between a 95% accurate network and a 98% accurate network or a 99% accurate network could mean billions of dollars of differences to Internet companies, and so this is a very big deal. And so they want their networks to be larger. They want to deploy their networks across more applications, and they want to train their network with new data all the time. And so training is a production matter. It is probably the largest HPC high performance computing application on the planet that we know of at the moment. And so we're scaling \u2013 we're ramping up training for production for hyperscale companies. On the other hand, I really appreciate you asking about the inferencing. We recently \u2013 well, this year, several months ago we announced the M4, the Tesla M4 that was designed for inferencing. And it's a little tiny graphics card, a little tiny processor, and it's less than 50 watts. It's called the M4. And at GTC, I announced a brand-new compiler called the GPU Inference Engine, GIE. And GIE recompiles the network that was trained so that they can be optimally inferenced at the lowest possible energy. And so not only are we already 50 watts, which is low-power, we can also now inference at a higher energy efficiency than any processor that we know of today, better than any CPU by a very, very long shot, better than any FPGA. And so now hyperscale companies could use our GPUs for both training, and they use exactly the same architecture for inferencing and the energy efficiency is really fantastic. Now, the benefit of using GPU for inferencing is that you're not just trying to inference only. You're trying to oftentimes decode the image or you could be decoding the video. You inference on it and you might even want to use it for transcoding, which is to re-encode that video and stream it to whoever it is that wants to share live video with. And so the (48:10) that you want to do on the images and the video and the data is more than just inferencing, and the benefit of our GPU is that it's really great for all of the other stuff, too. And so we're seeing lot of success in M4. I expect M4 to be quite a successful product. And hyperscale datacenters, my expectation, we'll start to ramp that into production Q2, Q3, Q4 timeframe.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. On the automotive side, I just wondered \u2013 and Colette, in your CFO commentary, you mentioned product development contract as part of the reason it was increasing. Can you just give us a little bit of indication of what those are? And is the percentage of the revenue coming from those increasing? And then maybe, finally, is that activity indicative of future growth in any way that can be a meaningful for us to track?\nColette M. Kress - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks for the question. So in our automotive business, there's definitely a process even before we're shipping platforms into the overall cars that we're work jointly with the auto manufacturer start-ups and others on what may be a future product. Many of those agreements continue, and will likely continue going forward, and that's what you see incorporated in our automotive business. So yes, you'll probably see this continue and go forward. It's not necessarily consistent. It starts in some quarters, bigger in other quarters, but that's what's incorporated in our automotive.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Colette, let me just add one thing. The thing to remember is that we're not selling chips into a car. We're not selling \u2013 you know that DRIVE PX is the world's first autonomous driving car computer that's powered by AI. It's powered by deep learning. And we're seeing lot of success with DRIVE PX, and as Colette mentioned earlier, there's some 80 companies that we're working with, whether it's tier 1s, or OEMs, or start-up companies all over the world that we're working with in this area of autonomous vehicles. And the thing to realize is you're not selling a chip into that car. You're working with a car company to build an autonomous driving car. And so that process requires a fair amount of engineering. And so we have a mechanism. We have a development mechanism that allows car companies to work with our engineers to collaborate to develop these self-driving cars, and that's what most of that stuff that Colette was talking about.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley & Company.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the revenue and margin performance. Jen-Hsun, I wanted to follow up on one of the comments that you made regarding Pascal. I think you indicated that all Pascal parts had taped out. So the question is, if that is the case, will we see refresh activity across all of the platform groups in fiscal 2017? Or in fact will some of the refresh activity be taking place in fiscal 2018? So what's the duration of the refresh that we're looking at?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Well, first, I \u2013 thanks for the question, and we don't comment on unannounced products as you know. I hate to ruin all of the surprises for you. But Pascal is the single most ambitious GPU architecture we have ever undertaken, and this is really the first GPU that was designed from the ground up for applications that are quite well beyond computer graphics and high-performance computing. It was designed to take into consideration all of the things that we've learned about deep learning, all of the things that we've learned about VR. For example, it has a brand new graphics pipeline that allows Pascal to simultaneously project into multiple services at the same time with no performance penalty. Otherwise, it would degrade your performance in VR by a factor of two, just because you have two services you're projecting into. And we can do all kinds of amazing things for augmented reality, other types of virtual reality displays, surround displays, curve displays, dome displays. I mean, there's all kinds of \u2013 holographic displays, there's all kinds of displays that are being invented at the moment, and we have the ability to now support those type of displays with a much more elegant architecture without degrading performance. So Pascal is \u2013 whether it's AI, whether it's gaming, whether it's VR, is really the most ambitious project we've ever undertaken, and it's going go through all of our markets. The application for self-driving cars is going be pretty exciting. It's going go through all of our markets. And so we're \u2013 of course, we have plenty to announce in the future but we've announced what we've announced.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Research. Please go ahead.\nRomit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thanks very much. Jen-Hsun, I was hoping you could just share your view today on fully autonomous driving because Mobileye's chairman has said very recently that the technology basically isn't ready and that fully autonomous cars won't be available until \u2013 I think he was saying 2019. And I guess my question is well, one, I'd love your view on that and, two, whether cars are fully autonomous or autonomous in certain environments, say, one year or two years out, does it impact the trajectory of your automotive business?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: First of all, to \u2013 working on full autonomy is a great endeavor. And whether we get there 100%, 90%, 92%, 93% is in my mind completely irrelevant. The endeavor of getting there and making your car more and more autonomous \u2013 initially, of course, we would like to have a virtual co-pilot. Having a virtual co-pilot is the way I get to work every day. Every single day I drive my Model S and every single day I put it into autonomous mode and every single day it brings me joy. And I'm not confessing necessarily, but texting a little bit is okay. And so I think that the path to full autonomy is going to be paved by amazing capabilities along the way. And so we're not waiting around for 2019. We'll ship autonomous vehicles by the end of this year. And so, I understand that we're three years ahead of other people's schedules. However, we also know that DRIVE PX 2 is the most advanced autonomous computing \u2013 car computer in the world today. And it's powered by AI fully. And DRIVE PX 2 \u2013 there will be a DRIVE PX 3, there will be a DRIVE PX 4, and then by 2019 I guess we'll be shipping DRIVE PX 5. So those \u2013 our roadmap is just like that. That's how we work as you guys know very well. And so I think there's a point \u2013 there's a lot of work to be done, which is the exciting part. The thing about a technology company, a thing about any company, unless there's great problems and great challenges that we can help solve, what value do we bring? And what NVIDIA does for a living is to do what \u2013 to build computers that no other company in the world can build. Whether it's high-performance computers that are used to power a nation's supercomputers or deep learning supercomputers so that we can gain insight from data or self-driving car computers so that autonomous cars can save people's lives and make people's lives more convenient, that's what we do. This is the work that we do and I'm delighted to hear that we're three years ahead of the competition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva with Topeka Capital Markets.\nSuji De Silva - Topeka Capital Markets: Hi, Jen-Hsun. Hi, Colette. Congratulations on the impressive results here. On the datacenter business, is there an inflection going on with deep learning with the software maturity that's driving some at this point? And can you give us any metrics, Jen-Hsun, for how to think about the size of this opportunity for you? I know it's hard but things like server attach rates, what percent of servers you could attach? Will it be an M4 in the high-end in every box, or maybe the number of GPUs a single deep learning implementation has? Something like that; that would help. Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: Yes. The truth is that nobody really knows how big this deep learning market is going to be. Until a couple of two years, three years ago, it was really even hard to imagine how good the results were going to be. And if it wasn't because of the groundbreaking work that was done at Google and Facebook and other researchers around the world, how would we have discovered that it was going to be superhuman? The work that recently was done at Microsoft Research, they've achieved superhuman levels of inferencing that \u2013 of image recognition and voice recognition that's really kind of hard to imagine, and these networks are now huge. The Microsoft research network, superdeep network is 1,000 layers deep. And so training such a network is quite a chore. It is quite an endeavor, and this is a problem that high performance computing will have to be deployed, and this is why our GPUs are so sought after. In terms of how big that's going be, my sense is at almost no transaction with the Internet will be without deep learning, or some machine learning inference in the future. I just can't imagine that. There's no recommendation of a movie, no recommendation of a purchase, no search, no image search, no text that won't somehow have passed through some smart chatbot or smartbot, or some machine learning algorithm so that they could make the transaction more \u2013 make the inference more \u2013 requests more useful to you. And so I think this is going to be a very big thing, and then on the other hand, the enterprises \u2013 we use deep learning all over our company today. And we're not \u2013 we had the benefit of being early, because we saw the power of this technology early on. But we're seeing deep learning being used now in medical imaging all over the world. We're seeing it being used in manufacturing. It's going to be used for scientific computing. More data is generated by high performance computers and supercomputers than just about anything. They generate through simulation. They generate so much data that they have to throw the vast majority of it away. For example, the hadron collider. Whenever the protons collide, they throw away 99% of the data, and they're able to barely keep up with just that 1%. And so by using machine learning and our GPUs, they could find insight in the rest of the 99%. So there are just applications go on and on and on, and people are now starting to understand, this deep learning, it really puts machine learning and puts artificial intelligence in the hands of engineers. It's understandable, and that's one of the reasons why it's growing so fast. And so I don't know exactly how big it's going to be, but here's my proposition. This is going to be the next big computing model. The way that people compute is that in the past, software programmers wrote programs, compiled it, and in the future, we're going to have algorithms write the software for us. And so that's a very (01:01:09) way of computing, and I think it's a very big deal.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDavid M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hey, thanks very much. In automotive, what product are your revenues coming from currently? Is DRIVE PX at all significant? Or are your sales primarily DRIVE PX, or something else?\nJen-Hsun Huang - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director: The primary parts of our automotive business today comes from infotainment and the premiere infotainment systems, for example the virtual cockpit that Audi ships, and I \u2013 the vast majority of our development projects today come from DRIVE PX (01:01:51) on those projects. We probably have 10 times as many autonomous driving projects as we have infotainment projects today, and we have a fair number of infotainment projects. And so that gives you a sense of where we were in the past, and where we're going in the future.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time, Mr. Chanda. Please, I'll turn the call over to you.\nArnab K. Chanda - Senior Director, Head of Investor Relations: We've had a great start to the year with strong revenue growth and profitability. Pascal is a quantum leap in performance for AI, gaming, and VR, and is in full production. Deep learning is springing across every industry, making datacenter our fastest growing business. With growing worldwide adoption of AI, the arrival of VR and the rise of self-driving cars, we're really excited about the future. Thanks for tuning in.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your line.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter and fiscal 2018 led by strong growth in our Gaming and Data Center businesses. Q4 revenue reached $2.91 billion, up 34% year-on-year, up 10% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.65 billion. All measures of profitability set records. They also hit important milestones. For the first time, gross margins strongly exceeded 60%, non-GAAP operating margins exceeded 40% and net income exceeded $1 billion. Fiscal 2018 revenue was $9.71 billion, up 41% or $2.8 billion above the previous year. These short platforms posted record full year revenue with data center growing triple digit. From a reporting segment perspective, Q4 GPU revenue grew 33% from last year to 2.46 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 75% to $450 million. Let\u2019s start with our Gaming business. Q4 revenue was $1.74 billion, up 29% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially with growth across all regions, driving GPU demand for a number of great titles during the holiday season, including Players Battleground, PUBG, Destiny 2, Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2. PUBG continued its remarkable run reaching almost 30 million players and recording more than 3 million concurrent players. These games delivered stunning, visible effects that requires strong graphics performance, which is driven a shift toward the higher end of our gaming portfolio and adoption of our Pascal architecture. eSports continues to grow, expanding the overall industry and our business. And one sign of their popularity Activision Overwatch League launched in January and reached 10 million viewers globally in its first week. We had a busy start to the year with a number of announcements at the Annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We introduced NVIDIA BFGDs, Big Format Gaming Displays in a partnership with ACER, ASUS and HP. The high-end 65-inch 4K displays enable ultralow latency gaming and interrogate our shield streaming devices, offering popular apps such Netflix, Gaming Video, YouTube and Hulu, the BFGD 19 best of show awards from various publications. We expanded the free beta of GeForce now beyond Macs to Window based PCs and we enhanced GeForce's experience with new features, including NVIDIA Freestyle for customizing gameplay with various filters and updated NVIDIA Ansel photo mode and support for new titles with ShadowPlay Highlights for capturing gaming achievements. Additionally, the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to our growth, as it became the fastest selling console of all time in the U.S. Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and some was not with our gaming GPUs. This contributed to lower than historical channel inventory levels of our gaming GPUs throughout the quarter. While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter. That said, our main focus remains on our core gaming market, as cryptocurrency trends will likely remain volatile. Moving to data center, revenue of $606 million was up 105% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially. This excellent performance reflected strong adoption of Tesla V100 GPUs based on our Volta architecture, which began shipping in Q2 and continued to ramp in Q3 and Q4. V100 are available through every major computer maker and have been chosen by every major cloud provider to deliver AI and high performance computing. Hyperscale and cloud customers adopting the V100 include Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, Google, IBM, Microsoft Azure, Oracle and Samsung. We continued our leadership in AI training markets where our GPUs remain the platform of choice for training, learning networks. During the quarter, Japan's preferred networks trends ResNet-503 network for image classification in a record of 15 minute by using 1,024 Tesla P100 GPUs. Our newer generation V100 delivered even higher performance with the Volta architecture offering 10 times the deep learning performance of Pascal. We also saw a growing traction in the AI inference market where NVIDIA's platform can improve performance and efficiency by orders of magnitude over CPUs. We continue to view AI inference as a significant new opportunity for our data center GPUs. Hyperscale inference applications that runs on GPUs includes speech recognition, image and video analytics, recommender system, translations, search and a natural language processing. The data center business also benefited from strong growth and high performance computing. The HPC community has increasingly moved to accelerated computing in recent years as Moore\u2019s law has begun to level off indeed more than 500 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated including all of the top 15. NVIDIA added a record 34 new GPU accelerated system to the latest top 500 supercomputer lift, bringing our total to 87 systems. We increased our total petaflops of list by 28% and we captured 14 of the top 20 slots on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy efficient supercomputers. During the quarter, we continue to support the build out of major next generation supercomputers among them that the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit System expected to be the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also announced new wins such as Japan\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer, the ABCI system, which leverages more than 4,000 Tesla V100 GPUs. Importantly, we are starting to see the conversions of HPC and AI as scientists embrace AI to solve problems faster. Modern supercomputers will need to support multiprocessing computation for applying deep learning together with simulation and testing. By combining AI with HPC, supercomputers can deliver increased performance that is orders of magnitude greater in computations ranging from particle physics to drug discovery to astrophysics. We are also seeing traction for AI in a growing number of vertical industries such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, smart cities, and healthcare. We announced engagements with GE Health and Nuance in medical imaging, Baker Hughes, a GE company in oil and gas and Japan Komatsu in construction and mining. Moving to professional visualization, fourth quarter revenue grew to a record 254 million, up 13% from a year ago, up 6% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 30% of pro visualization sales. We saw strength across several key industries including defense, manufacturing, energy, healthcare and internet service providers among key customers high end quality products are being used by GlaxoSmithKline for AI and by Pemex oil and gas for seismic processing and visualization. Turning to automotive. In automotive for fourth quarter, revenue grew 3% on year to 132 million and was down 8% sequentially. The sequential decline reflects our condition from infotainment which is becoming commoditized to next generation AI cockpits systems and complete top to bottom self-driving vehicle platforms built on NVIDIA hardware and software. At CES, we demonstrated our leadership position in autonomous vehicles with several key milestones and new partnership that point to AI self-driving cars, moving from deployment to production. In a scanning room only key note that drew nearly 8,000 attendees, Jensen announced that DRIVE Xavier the world's first autonomous machine processor will be available to customers this quarter with more than 9 billion transistors DRIVE Xavier is the most complex system on ever created. We also announced in NVIDIA Drive is the world's first functionally saved AI self-driving platform, enabling automakers to create autonomous vehicles they can operate safely and necessary ingredient for going to market. Additionally, we announced a number of collaboration of CES including with Uber, which has been using in video technology for the AI continuing system and its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. We announced that ZF and Baidu are using NVIDIA Drive self-driving technology to create a production ready AI autonomous vehicle platform for China, the world's largest automotive market. Production vehicles utilizing this technology including those from chariots expected on the road by 2020. We also announced partnership with Aurora which is working to create a modular scalable Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving hardware platform incorporating the NVIDIA Drive Xavier processor. Jen-Hsun Huang joined on stage by Volkswagen CEO, Herbert Diess, they announced the new generation of intelligently VW vehicles for using NVIDIA Drive intelligent experience or drive IX, platform to create the new AI infused cockpit experiences and improved safety. Later CES, Mercedes-Benz announced that MBUX its new AI based smart cockpit uses NVIDIA graphics in the AI technologies. The MBUX user experience which includes beautiful touch screen displays and a new voice activated assistant, they viewed it last week at Mercedes-Benz A-Class compact car and we will shift this frame. And earlier this week, we announced a partnership with Continental to build AI self-driving vehicle systems from enhanced Level 2 to Level 5 for production in 2021. There are now more than 320 companies and research institutions using the NVIDIA Drive platform that\u2019s up 50% from a year ago and encompasses virtually every car marker, truck maker, robo-taxi company, mapping company, center manufacture and self starter in the autonomous vehicle ecosystem. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the inter-meet to long-term opportunities for autonomous driving. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 61.9% and non-GAAP was 62.1%, record that reflect continued growth in our value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $728 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $607 million up 28% and 22% year-over-year respectively. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP EPS was $1.78, up 80% from a year earlier, some of the upside was driven by a lower than expected tax rate, as a result of U.S. tax reform and excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation. Our fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was a benefit of 3.7% compared with our expectation of a tax rate of 17.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was a $1.72, up 52% from a year ago, reflecting a quarterly tax rate of 10.5% compared with our expectation of 17.5%. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash from operations reached record levels at $1.36 billion, bringing our fiscal year total to a record $3.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $469 million for the four quarter, inclusive of $335 million associated with the purchase of our previously financed Santa Clara campus building. Let me take a moment to provide a bit more detail on the impact of U.S. corporate tax reform on the quarter and our go forward financials. In Q4, we reported a GAAP only one-time net tax benefit of $133 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This is primarily related to provisional tax amounts for the transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We previously accrued for taxes on a portion of foreign earnings in excess of the provisional tax amount recorded for the transition tax hence the one-time benefit. For fiscal 2019, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be around 12% which is down from approximately 17% previously. This does not take into effect the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation, which depending stock price investing schedule could increase or decrease our tax rate in GAAP in a given quarter. In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first and foremost on investing in our business as we see significant opportunities ahead. Our lower tax rate strengthens our ability to invest in both OpEx such as adding engineering talent as well as CapEx such as investing in supercomputers for internal AI development. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, with our plan remaining at $1.25 billion for fiscal 2019. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.7% and 63% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $770 million and $645 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&Es are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 12% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect our operating expenses to grow at a similar pace as in Q1. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, I like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community will be presenting at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 13th and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on February 26th. We will also be hosting our Annual Investor Day on March 27th in Sam Hose on the sidelines of our annual GPU Technology Conference, which we are very excited about. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you pole for questions please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C. J. Muse from Evercore.\nC. J. Muse: I guess first question when I think about normal seasonality for gaming that would imply data center potentially more than $700 million plus into the coming quarter. And so, curious if I am thinking about that right whether crypto has been modeled more conservatively by you guys, and so would love to hear your thoughts there?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Which way is more conservatively?\nC. J. Muse: Yes, sorry.\nJen-Hsun Huang: When you say conservatively, which direction are you saying was are you implying up or down?\nC. J. Muse: Well curiously to your thoughts there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We model crypto approximately flat.\nC. J. Muse: Okay. And then I guess as part of the larger question. How are you thinking about seasonality for gaming into the quarter?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, there are a lot of dynamics going on in gaming, what dynamic of course is that there is a fairly sizable pent up demand going into this quarter. But I think a larger dynamics that are happening relate to just a really amazing games that are out right now. PUBG is doing incredibly well as you might have known and it\u2019s become a global phenomenon and whether it\u2019s here in United States or Europe or in China, in Asia. PUBG is just doing incredibly well and we expect other developers that come with up similar genre like PUBG that can become in the near future and I am super excited about these games. And there is of course Call of Duty, there is Star Wars that, there are just only so many great games around the market like today. Overwatch and League of Legends are still doing well. They just catalyst number of great franchises that are out in the marketplace and the gaming market is growing and production valley is going up and that's driving increased unit sales of GPUs as well as APSs of GPUs. And so, I think those are that\u2019s probably the larger dynamic of gaming.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lopasif with Jefferies.\nQ - : The first question, the checks we've done indicate that the Tensor Core you put into Volta give it a huge advantage in neural network applications in the data center. I am wondering whether the Tensor Core might also have a similar kind of utility in the gaming market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, first of all I appreciate you are asking a Tensor Core question. It is probably the single biggest innovation we had last year in data centers. Our GPU the equivalent performance to one of our GPUs, and one of our multi-GPUs would take something along the lines of 20 plus GPUs or 10 plus notes. And so one GPU alone would do deep learning so fast that it would 10 plus CPU powered server notes to keep it with. And then Tensor Core comes along last year and we increased the throughput of deep learning, increased the computation throughput deep learning by another factor of eight. And so Tensor Core really illustrates the power of GPU, it's very unlike a CPU when the instruction sets remain locked for a long-term and its hard, it's difficult to advance. In the case of our GPUs and with could that\u2019s one of its fundamental advantages, we can continue to year in and year out, continue to add new facilities to it. And so Tensor Core boost of the original great performance of our GPU is really raised the bar last year. And as ColetteI said earlier, our Volta GPU has now been adopted all over the world whether it's in China with Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, iFlytek too. Here in United States Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and IBM and Oracle. And in Europe and Japan, the number of cloud service provides that have adopted Volta has been terrific. And I think I already really appreciated the work that we did with Tensor Core and although the updates they are now coming out from the frameworks, Tensor Core is the new instruction fit and new architecture and the deep learning developers have really jumped on it and almost every deep learning frame work is being optimized to take advantage of Tensor Core. On the inference side, on the inference side and that\u2019s where it would play a role in video games. You could use deep learning now to synthesize and to generate new art, and we been demonstrating some of that as you could see, if you could you seen some of that whether it improve the quality of textures, generating artificial, characters, animating characters, whether its facial animation with for speech or body animation. The type of work that you could do with deep learning for video games is growing. And that\u2019s where Tensor Core to take up could be a real advantage. If you take a look at the computational that we have in Tensor Core compare to a non optimized GPU or even a CPU, it's now to plus orders of magnitude on greater competition of throughput. And that allows us to do things like synthesize images in real time and synthesize virtual world and make characters and make faces, bringing a new level of virtual reality and artificial intelligence to the video games.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Jen-Hsun just a near and longer term question on the data center. Near-term you would have a number of strong quarters in data center, how is the utilization of these GPU? And how do you measure whether you're over or under from a supply prospective? And then longer them, there seems to be a lot of money going into startup developing silicon for deep learning. Is there any advantage they\u2019ve been taking a clean sheet approach? Or is GPU the most optimal answer? Like, if you were starting a new company looking at AI today, would you make another GPU or would you make another ASIC or some other format? Just any color would be helpful?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. In the near-term, the best way to measure customers that are already using our GPUs for deep learning is repeat customers. When they come back another quarter, another quarter and they continue to buy GPUs that would suggest that the workflows continue to increase. The -- with existing customers that already have a very deep penetration, another opportunity for us would be using our GPUs for inference and that\u2019s an untapped growth opportunity for our company that's really, really exciting, we're traction there. For companies that are not at the forefront, the absolute forefront of deep learning, which -- with the exception of one or two or three hyperscalers, almost everybody else I\u2019ll put in this category. And their deployment, their adoption of deep learning, applying deep learning to all of their applications, is still ongoing. And so I think the second wave of our customers is just showing up. And then there is a third wave of customer which is, they're not hyperscalers, they are internet service -- service applications, internet applications for consumers. They have enormous customer basis and that they could apply to artificial intelligence to, but they run their application in hyperscale clouds. That third phase of growth is now really spiking and I'm excited about that. And so that's kind of the way to think about it. The pioneers and the first phase are the training customers. Then there is the second phase that\u2019s now ramping. The third phase, that\u2019s now ramping. And then for everybody, we have an opportunity to apply our GPUs for inference. If I had all the money in the world, and I had for example billions and billions of dollars of R&D, I would give it to NVIDIA\u2019s GPU team, which is exactly what I do. And the reason for that is because GPU was already inherently the world's best high throughput computational processor. A high throughput processor is a lot more complicated than a linear algebra done that you instantiate from a synopsys tool stores. It's not quite that easy. The computation throughput keeping everything moving through your chip with supreme levels of energy efficiency, with all of the software that is -- that\u2019s needed to keep the data flowing with all of the optimizations and you do with each and every one of the frameworks. The amount of complexity there is just really enormous. The networks are changing all the time, it started out with just basically CNNs and then all kinds of versions of CNNs, now it started out with RNNs and simple RNNs and now there is kinds of LSTMs and gated RNNs and all kinds of interesting networks they're growing. It\u2019s started out with just eight layers and now its 152 layers, going to a 1,000 layers. It started with mostly recognition and now it\u2019s moving to synthesis with GANs. And there's, so many versions of GANs. And so, all of these different types of networks are really, really hard to nail down and we're still at the beginning of AI. So, the ability for our GPUs to be programmable to all of these different architectures and networks, it's just an enormous advantage. You don't ever have to guess whether NVIDIA GPUs. It could be used for one particular network and other. And so you can buy our GPUs at well and know that every single GPU that you buy gives an opportunity to reduce the number of servers and you data center by 22 nodes, by 10 nodes, 22 CPUs. And so the more GPU you buy, the more money you save. So, I think that capability is really quite unique and like I just give one example from last year or from previous year, we introduced a 16-bit mixed precision, we introduced 8-bit imager, we introduced -- the year before this last year. This last year, we introduced Tensor core which increased by another factor of nearly 10. Meanwhile our GPUs get more complex, imager efficiency gets better and better every single year and the software origin gets more amazing. And so, it\u2019s a much harder problem than just a multiply accumulator. Artificial intelligence is the single most complex mono software that world is ever known that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s taken so long to get here, and these high performance supercomputers is an essential ingredient, an essential instrument in advancing AI. And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as simple as liner algebra. But you might have all the money in the world, I would invest it in the team that we have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I have a question for Colette. So if I correct for the switch revenue growth in the quarter, it means that the gaming business X which was at maybe $140 million or $150 million. In your Q3 commentary, you did not call out crypto was a driver. You are calling out it in Q4. Is it fair to say that like that incremental growth is all crypto? And I guess going forward, you mentioned pent up demand, normally your seasonality for gaming will be down probably double digit. Do you think that pent up demand is enough to reverse that normal seasonal pattern or normally down? And frankly, do you think gamers can even find GPU at retail at this point to buy in order to satisfy that pent up demand?\nColette Kress: So, let me comment on first one. We did talk about our overall crypto business last quarter as well. We indicated how much we had in OEM boards and we also indicated that there was definitely some with our GTX business. Keep in mind that\u2019s very difficult for us to quantify down to the end customers view. But yes, there is also some in our Q3 and we did comment all that. So here, we are commenting in terms of what we saw in terms of Q4. It\u2019s up a bit from what we saw in Q3 and we do again expect probably going forward. Although, Jen-Hsun answered regarding the demand for gamers as we move forward.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, so one way to think about the Tensor demand as we typically have somewhere between six to eight weeks for inventory in the channel, and I think you would ascertain that globally right now the channels relatively lean. We're working really hard to get GPU down to the marketplace for the gamers and we\u2019re doing everything to advise retailers and system builders to serve the gamers. And so, we\u2019re doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is we just got to catching for supply.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.\nMitch Steves: And I just want to circle back with autos and so with at CES, so it's kind of on track for towards calendar year '19 in that what we see the autonomous kind of ASP uplift. And just the clarify the expected ASP uplift, all around $1,000, is that all right?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, it just depends on mix. I think for autonomous vehicle that still have drivers passenger cars, branded cars, ASP anywhere from $500 to $1,000 makes sense. For robot taxies where they are driverless, they are not autonomous vehicles they are actually drivers less vehicles, the ASP will be several $1,000. And in terms of timing, I think that you\u2019re going to see a larger and larger deployment starting this year, and I'm going through next year for sure especially with robust taxies. And then with autonomous vehicles, cars that have autonomous driving capability, automotive driving capability start late 2019, you could see a lot more in 2020 and just almost every creating car by 2022 will have autonomous automatic driving capabilities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Jen-Hsun, I was hoping to ask a little bit about inferencing. How big was inferencing within data center in Q4 or fiscal '18? And more importantly, how do you expect that the trend over the next 12 to 18 months?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all just the comment about inference, the way that it works as you take the output of these frameworks and the output of these frameworks is a really complex large computational graph. And when you think about these neural networks and they have millions of parameters, millions of parameters, millions of anything is very complex. And these parameters are ways in activation layers and activation functions and they are millions of them. And it's million of them composes consist of this computational graph. And this computational graph has all kind of interesting and complicated layers. And so you take this computation graphic that comes out of each one of these frameworks and they all are different, they're in different formats, they're in different styles, they're different architectures and they are all different. And you take these computational graphs and you have to find a way to compile it, to optimize this graph, to rationalize all of the things that you could combine and fold, reduce the amount of conflict across all of the recourses that are in your GPU or your processor. And these conflicts could be on to memory and register follows, data paths and it could be the fabric, it could be the framework of interface, it could be the amount of memory. But you got this computers are really complicated across all these different processors, and the interconnect between GPU, the network connects multiple notes, and so you kind figure out what all these different complex are, resources are and compile and optimize to take advantage of to keep it moving all the time. And so, TensorRT is basically a very sophisticated optimizing graph compilation, graph complier. And it targets each one of our processors, the way it targets Xavier is different than way it targets Volta and the way it targets our inference, the way it targets for low energy for different precisions. Now, all of that targeting is a little bit is different. And so first of all TensorRT, the software of inference that's really where the magic is. Then, the second thing that we do, we optimize our GPUs for extremely high throughput and to support different precisions because some networks afford to have 8 bit imager or even less, some really can barely get by with 16 bit floating point and some you really would like to keep it at 32 bit floating point. So, that you don't have to expect and guess about any precisions that you lost along the way. And so, we created an architecture that consists of this optimizing graph, computational graph complier to processors that are very high throughout that makes precision. Okay. So that\u2019s kind of the background. We start -- we've been sampling our Tesla P4, which is our data center inference processor. And we\u2019re seeing just really existing response. And this quarter, we started shipping, we\u2019re looking outwards. My sense is that the inference market is probably about as large in the data centers as training, and the wonderful thing is everything that you train our processor will inference wonderfully in our processors as well. And the data centers are really awakening to the observation that the more GPUs they buy for uploading inference and training, the more money they save. And the amount of money they save is not 20% or 50%, its factors of 10%. The money savings for all these data centers that are becoming increasingly capital constrained is really quite dramatic. And then the other inference opportunity for us is autonomous machines, which is self-driving cars. TensorRT also targets Xavier, TensorRT targets our Pegasus, a robot taxi computer and they all have to inference incredibly efficiently, so that we can sustain real-time, keeping energy level low and keep the cost low, keep the cost low for core companies. Okay. So I think inference is a very important work for us. It is very complicated work and we\u2019re making great progress.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis: Just kind of curious as you look at the gaming business, I have kind of lost track with seasonality as you really have a big ramp ahead. And I\u2019m just kind of curious as we think about Pascal of our seasonality ahead of Volta, if you could just kind of extrapolate as you look out into April and maybe July?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we don't -- we haven\u2019t announced 2018 for April or July. And so the best way to think about that is, Pascal is the best gaming platform on the planet. It is the most future feature rich software. The most energy efficient and from $99 to $1,000 you can buy the world\u2019s best GPU, the most advanced GPUs and you buy Pascal you know you got the best. Seasonality is a good question and increasingly because gaming is a global market and because people play games every day. It\u2019s just part of their life. There is no -- I don\u2019t think there is much seasonality in the TV or books or music, people just whenever new titles comes out that\u2019s when the new season starts. And so in China, there is iCafes and there is Singles' Day November 11, there is Back to School in the United States, there is Christmas, there is Chinese New Year. Boy, that there are so many seasons that is kind of hard to imagine what exactly seasonality is anymore. So hopefully overtime, it becomes most of a matter. But most appointing is that, we expect Pascal to continue to be world\u2019s best gaming platform for foreseeable future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\nHarlan Sur: I know somebody asked a question about inferencing for the data center market, but on inferencing embedded in Edge application on the software and firmware side. You talked about TensorRT framework, on the hardware side you got the Jetson TX platform embedded and Edge inferencing applications things like drones and factory automation and transportation. What else is the team doing in the embedded market to capture more of the same opportunities that are going forward?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks a lot, Harlan. The video Tensor RT is really the only optimizing inference compiler in the world today and it targets all our platforms. And we do inference in the data center that I mentioned earlier. In the embedded world, the first embedded platform we\u2019re targeting is self-driving cars. In order to drive the cars, you are basically inference or try to predict your perceive what's around you all the time and that\u2019s a very complicated inference matter. It could be extremely easy like taking the car in front of you and applying the breaks or could be critically hard which is trying to figure out whether you should stop in intersection or not. If you look at most intersections, you can't just look at the lights to determine and where do you stop there were few lines. And so using scene understanding than using deep learning, we have the ability to recognize where to stop and where not to stop. And then for Jetson, we have a platform called Metropolis and Metropolis is used for a very large scale smart cities where cameras are deployed all over to keep city safe. We\u2019ve been very successful in smart cities just about every major smart city provider and what's called intelligent video analysis company whether almost all over the world as using NVIDIA\u2019s video platform to do inference at the Edge, AI at the edge. And then we\u2019ve announced recently success with FANUC, the largest manufacturing robotics company in the world, Komatsu, one of the largest constructions equipments company in the world to apply AI at the Edge for autonomous machines. Drones, we\u2019ve several industrial drones that are inspecting pipelines and expecting power lines, flying over large spans of farms to figure out where to spay insecticides more accurately. There is all kinds of applications. So, you're absolutely right that inference at the Edge or AI at the edge is a very large market opportunity for us and that\u2019s exactly why TensorRT was created.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: You mentioned how lean the channel is in terms of gaming cards. There has been an absorbable increase in prices at retail. And I am just curious, is that a broad-based phenomenal? And is there any economic ramification to you? Or is that just sort of retailers bringing prices up in a shortage environment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don\u2019t set prices at the end of the market, and the best way for us to solve this problem is, work and supply. The demand is great and it's very likely the demand will remain great as we look through this quarter. And so, we just have to keep working on increasingly supply. We have our suppliers are world best and a largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world and they\u2019re responding incorrectly and I'm really grateful for everything they are doing, we dot got a catch up to that demand, which is such really great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChris Rolland: Just to clarify in terms of pent up demand, one of your GPU competitors basically said that constraints was memory. I just want to make sure that was correct? And then in the CFO commentary, you mentioned opportunities for professional biz, like AI and deep learning. Can you talk about that in more kind of application you would use Quadro versus Volta or GeForce Specs?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We\u2019re just constraints. Obviously, we're ten times larges of a GPU supplier than the competition and so we have a lot more suppliers supporting us and a lot more distributors taking approach to market and lot more partners distributing our products all over the world. And so, I don\u2019t know how to explain this right from demand is just really great. And so we just got to keep our nose to it and catch up the demand. With respect to Quadro, Quadro is a work station processor. The entire software stack is designed for all of the applications that the work station industry uses. And it\u2019s the quality of the rendering is of course world-class because NVIDIA, but the entire software stack has been designed so that mission critical applications or long-life industrial applications and companies that are enormous and gigantic manufacturing and industrial companies in the world could rely on an entire platform, which consist of processors and systems and software and middleware and all the integrations into all of the CAD tools in the world. To know that that the supplier is going to be here and can be trusted for the entire life of the use of that product which could be several years, but the data that is generated from it, has to be accountable for a couple of decades. You need to be able to pull up an entire design of a plane or train or a car, a couple decades after it was sent to production to make sure that is still on complaint, and if there is question about it that it could be pulled up. NVIDIA's entire platform was designed to be professional class, professional grade low-lived. Now, the thing that's really exciting about some artificial intelligence is, we now can use AI to improve images. For example, you could fix a photograph using AI. You could fill in on damaged parts of a photograph or parts of the image that hasn't been rendered yet. You want to use AI to fill in the dots, predict the future, rendering results, which we announced and which we demonstrated at GTC recently. You can use that to generate designs. You sketch up a few strokes of what you want to car to look like, and based on the inventory, safety, physics, you could -- it has learned how to fill in the rest of it. Okay. Design the rest of chasse on your behalf. It\u2019s called generative design. We\u2019re going to see generative design in product design and building design and just like everything. The last, if you will, 90% of the work is after the initial installation network, the conceptual design has done. That part of it could be highly automated through AI. And so, Quadro can be used as a platform that designs as well as generatively designs. And then lastly a lot of people are using our workstations to also train their neural networks for the generative designs. And so you could train and develop your own networks and then apply it in the applications. Okay. So, AI, think of AI really as, in the final analysis, the future way of developing software is a brand new capability where computers can write its own software and the software that's written is so complex and so capable that no humans could write it ourselves. And so, you can teach, you can use data to teach a software to figure out how to write the software by itself. And then when you're done developing the software, you can use it to do all kinds of stuff, including design products. And so for work stations that\u2019s how it\u2019s used.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nQ - : A lot of near-term items here on gaming. So, I\u2019ll switch it to longer term. Jen-Hsun at CES, I think you said that there are now 200 million GeForce users globally, and if my math is correct then that would be up about 2X over the last three to four years. So the question is, is there anything that you can see that would preclude that kind of growth over a similar period? And given the recent demand dynamics, I think we've seen that INVIDIA\u2019s direct channels have been very good sources for GPUs of the prices that you intend. So as we look ahead, should we expect any change in channel management from the Company?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot, Craig. In the last several years, several dynamics happened at the same time. And all of that were the favorable contributions to today. First of all, gaming became global market and China became one of the largest gaming markets in the world. The second, because the market became so big, developers could invest extraordinary amounts into the production value of the videogame. They could invest a few hundred million dollars and though they are going to get return on. Back when the videogame industry was quite small or PC game was small, it was too risky for developer to invest that much. And so now, an investor a developer could invest hundreds of millions of dollars and create something that is just completely for the realistic and emerged that just beautiful. And so when the production value goes up, the GPU technology that\u2019s needed to run it well goes up, it\u2019s very different than music, it\u2019s very different than watching movies, everything in videogames is emphasized in real time. And so when the production value goes up, the ASP with a technology has to go up. And then lastly, the size of the market and people wonder how big the videogame market is going to be and I am always believe that videogame market is going to be literally everyone. In 10 years time, 15 years time, there can be another billion people on earth and those people are going to be gamers, we see more and more gamers. And not to mention that almost every single sport could be the virtual reality sport. So videogame is every sport so this sport can be any sport and every sport and every type of sport. And so I think when you consider this and put that in your mind I think the opportunity for videogames is going to be quite large and that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\nWilliam Stein: I am hoping we can touch on automotive a little bit more. In particular, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about expecting sort of a low in revenue growth in this market and till roughly the 2020 timeframe when autonomous driving kicks in more meaningful way. But of course you have the AI co-pilot that seems to be potentially ramping sooner, and you have at least one marquee customer that is ramping now I guess that volumes aren\u2019t quite that large on the autonomous driving side. So any guidance as to when we might see these two factors start to accelerate revenue in that end market?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot Will. I wish I have more precision for you, but here some of the dynamics that I believe in. I believe that autonomous capability, autonomous driving is the single greatest dynamic next to EVs in the automotive industry. And transportation is a $10 trillion industry between cars and shuttles and buses, delivery vehicles. I mean it just an extraordinary market and everything that\u2019s kind of move in the future will be autonomous that\u2019s for sure, and it will be autonomous fully or it will be autonomous partly. The size of this marketplace is quite large. In the near term, our path to that future which I believe starts in 2019 and 2020, but starts very strongly in 2022. I believe the path to that in our case has several elements. The first element is that in work for all these companies, whether they are Tier 1s or start up or OEMs or taxi companies or ride hailing companies or tractor companies or shuttle companies or piece of delivery on the shuttles. In order to deliver -- in order to create there autonomous driving capability, the first thing I have to do is train in your network. And we created a platform we called the NVIDIA GTX that allows everybody to train a neural networks as quickly as possible. So that first, it\u2019s the development of the AI requires GPU, and we benefit first from that. And the second is, which will start this year and next year is development platforms for the cars themselves, for the vehicles themselves. And finally, Xavier here, we have a first kind of Xavier, the most complex SoC that the world ever made. And we\u2019re super excited about the state of Xavier and we're going to be sampling in Q1. And so now, we will be able to help everybody create development systems and will be 1000s and 10,000s of quite expensive development systems based on Xavier and based on that Pegasus that world is going to need. And so that\u2019s the second element, the third element in the near-term will be development agreements, each one of these projects are engineering intensive. And there is a development agreement that goes along way with it. And so these three elements, these three components are in the near-term, and then hopefully starting from 2019 going forward and very strongly going from 2022 and beyond at the actual car revenues and economics will show up. I appreciate the question and I think this is our last question. Well, we have a record quarter ramping up with record year. We've strong momentum and our gaming, AI, data center and self-driving car businesses. It's great to see adoption of the NVIDIA's GPU computing platform increasing in so many industries. We accomplished a great deal this last year and we have big plans for this coming year. Next month, the brightest minds and AI and scientific world will come together at our GPU technology conference at San Jose. GTC has grown tenfold in the last five years. This year we expect more than 8,000 attendees. GTC has a place to be if you're an AI researchers or doing any field of science where computing is your essential instrument, there will be over 500 powers of talks of recent breakthroughs and discoveries by leaders in the field just Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and many others. Developers from industries ranging from healthcare to transportation to manufacturing entertainment will come together and share state-of-the-art and AI. This is going to be a big GTC. I hope to see all of you there.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO Commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with record revenue in each of our four market platforms. And every measure of profit hit record levels, reflecting the leverage of our model. Data center revenue of $501 million more than doubled from a year ago and the strong adoption of our Volta platform and early traction with our inferencing portfolio. Q3 revenue reached $2.64 billion, up 32% from a year earlier, up 18% sequentially and well above our outlook of $2.35 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 31% from last year to $2.22 billion. Tegra processor revenue rose 74% to $419 million.  Let's start with our Gaming business. Gaming revenue was $1.56 billion, up 25% year-on-year and up 32% sequentially. We saw robust demand across all regions and form factors. Our Pascal-based GPUs remained the platform of choice for gamers as evidenced by our strong demand for GeForce GTX 10-Series products. We introduced the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti which became available last week. It complements our strong holiday lineup, ranging from the entry-level GTX 1050 to flagship GTX 1080 Ti. A wave of great titles is arriving for the holidays, driving enthusiasm in the market. We collaborated with Activision to bring Destiny 2 to the PC early in the month. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds popularly known as [indiscernible], continues to be one of the year's most successful titles. We are closely aligned with PUB G to ensure that GeForce is the best way to play the game, including bringing shadow play highlights to its 20 million players. Last weekend, Call of Duty: World War II had a strong debut. And Star Wars Battlefront 2 will be [indiscernible]. E-sports remains one of the most important secular growth drivers in the Gaming market with a fan base that now exceeds 350 million. Last weekend, the League of Legends World Championship was held in Beijing's National Stadium, The Bird's Nest where the 2008 Olympic Games were held. More than 40,000 fans attended live. And online viewers were said to break last year's record of 43 million following in 18 languages.  GPU sales also benefited from continued cryptocurrency money. We met some of this demand with a dedicated board in our OEM business and a portion with GeForce GTX boards, though it's difficult to quantify. We remain nimble in our approach to the cryptocurrency market. It is volatile, does not and will not distract us from focusing on our core Gaming market. Lastly, Nintendo Switch console continues to gain momentum since launching in March and also contributed to growth. Moving to data center; our data center business had an outstanding quarter. Revenue of $501 million more than doubled from last year and rose 20% on the quarter and its strong traction of the new Volta architecture. Shipments of the Tesla V100 GPU began in Q2 and ramped significantly in Q3, driven primarily by demand from cloud service providers and high-performance computing. As we have noted before, Volta delivers 10x the deep learning performance of our Pascal architecture, which has been introduced just a year earlier, far outpacing Moore's Law. The V100 is being broadly adopted with every major server OEM and cloud provider. In China, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent announced that they are incorporating V100 in their datacenters and cloud server, service infrastructures. In the U.S., Amazon Web Services announced that V100 inferences are now available in four of its regions. Oracle Cloud has just added Tesla P100 GPUs to its infrastructure offerings and plans to expand to the V100 GPUs. We expect support from V100 from other major cloud providers as well.  In addition, all major server OEMs announced support for the V100, [indiscernible], Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, IBM and Supermicro are incorporating it in servers. And China's top server OEMs, Huawei, Insper and Lenovo have adopted our HGX server architecture to build a new generation of accelerated datacenters with V100 GPUs. Our new offerings for the AI inference market are also gaining momentum. The recently launched TensorRT programmable inference acceleration platform opened a new market opportunity for us, improving the performance and reducing the cost of AI inferencing in order -- by orders of magnitude compared with CPUs. It supports every major deep learning framework, every network architecture and any level of network complexity. More than 1,200 companies are already using our inference platform, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, [indiscernible], Hi Vision and Tencent. During the quarter, we announced that the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry or NGC is now available through Amazon's cloud and will be supported soon by other cloud platforms. NGC helps developers get started with deep learning development through no-cost access to a comprehensive easy-to-use, fully optimized deep learning software stack. It enables instant access to the most widely used GPU-accelerated frameworks. We also continued to see robust growth in our HPC business. Next-generation supercomputers such as the U.S. Department of Energy's CRM Summit Systems expected to come online next year, leverage Volta's industry-leading performance and our pipeline is strong. The past weeks have been exceptionally busy for us. We have hosted five major GPU Technology Conferences in Beijing, Munich, Taipei, Tel Aviv and Washington, with another next month in Tokyo. In a strong indication of the growing importance of GPU-accelerated computing, more than 22,000 developers, data scientists and others will come this year to our GTCs, including the main event in Silicon Valley, that's up 10x in just five years. Other key metrics show similar gains. Over the same period, the number of NVIDIA GPU developers has grown 15x to 645,000; and the number of CUDA downloads this year are up 5x to 1.8 million.  Moving to Professional Visualization; third quarter revenue grew to $239 million, up 15% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially, driven by demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations. The defense and automotive industries grew strongly as the demand for professional VR solutions driven by Quadro P5000 and P6000 GPUs. Among key customers, Audi and BMW are deploying VR in auto showrooms. And the U.S. Army, Navy and Homeland Security are using VR for mission training. Last month, we announced early access to NVIDIA Holodeck, the intelligent VR collaboration platform. Holodeck enables designers, developers and their customers to come together virtually from anywhere in the world in a highly realistic, collaborated and physically simulated environment. Future updates will address the growing demand for the development of deep learning techniques and virtual environments. In automotive, revenue grew to $144 million, up 13% year-over-year and up slightly from last quarter. Among key developments this quarter, we announced DRIVE PX Pegasus, the world's first AI computer for enabling Level 5 driverless vehicles. Pegasus will deliver over 320 trillion operations per second, more than 10x its predecessor. It's powered by four high-performance AI processors in a supercomputer that is a size of a license plate. NVIDIA DRIVE is being used by over 25 companies to develop fully autonomous robotaxis and DRIVE PX Pegasus will become the path to production. It is designed for [indiscernible] Certification, the industry's highest safety level and will be available in the second half of 2018.  We also introduced the DRIVE Ix SDK for delivering intelligence experiences inside the vehicle. DRIVE Ix provides a platform for car companies to create and always engage AI Co-Pilot. It uses deep learning networks to track head movement and gauge and it will have a conversation with the driver using advanced speech recognition, lip-reading and natural language understanding. We believe this will set the standard for the next generation of infotainment systems, a market that is just beginning to develop. Finally, we announced that DHL, the world's largest mail and package delivery service, and [indiscernible], one of the world's leading automotive suppliers, will deploy a test lead of autonomous delivery trucks next year using the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform. DHL will outfit electric light trucks with the ZF Pro AI self-driving system based on our technology. Now turning to the rest of the income statement; Q3 GAAP gross margins was 59.5% and non-GAAP was 59.7%, both up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in value-added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $674 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $570 million, consistent with our outlook and up 19% year-on-year. Investing in our key market opportunities is essential to our future, including Gaming, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP operating income was a record $895 million, up 40% from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $1.01 billion, up 42% from a year ago. GAAP net income was a record $838 million and EPS was $1.33, up 55% and 60%, respectively, from a year earlier. Non-GAAP net income was $833 million and EPS was $1.33, up 46% and 41%, respectively from a year earlier, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. We've returned $1.16 billion to shareholders so far this fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We have announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.01 to an annualized $0.60, effective with our Q4 fiscal year '18 dividend. We are also pleased to announce that we intend to return another $1.25 billion to shareholders for fiscal 2019 through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels, surpassing $1 billion for the first time to $1.16 billion.  Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018; we expect revenue to be $2.65 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.7% and 60% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $722 million and $600 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 17.5%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Other financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our website.  We will now open the call for questions. Please limit your question to one. Operator, we will -- would you please pool for questions? Thank you\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Jen-Hsun, three months ago, you described the July quarter as a transition quarter for your data center business. And clearly, you guys have ramped very well into October. But if you can talk a little bit about the outlook for the next couple of quarters in data center? And particularly on the inferencing side. I know you guys are really excited about that opportunity. So if you can share customer feedback and what your expectations are into the next year in inferencing, that will be great.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. As you know, we started ramping very strongly Volta this last quarter. And we started the ramp the quarter before. And since then, every major cloud provider from Amazon, Microsoft, Google to Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent and even recently, Oracle, has announced support for Volta and we'll be providing Volta for their internal use of deep learning as well as external public cloud services. We also announced that every major server computer maker in the world has now supported Volta and in the process of taking Volta out to market. HP and Dell and IBM and Cisco and Huawei in China, Insper in China, Lenovo, have all announced that they will be building service -- families of servers around the Volta GPU. So I think we -- this ramp is just the first part of supporting the build out of GPU-accelerated service from our company for data centers all over the world as well as cloud service providers all over the world. The applications for these GPU servers has now grown to many markets. I've spoken about the primary segments of our Tesla GPUs. There are five of them that I talk about regularly. The first one is high-performance computing where the market is $11 billion or so. It is one of the faster growing parts of the IT industry because more and more people are using high-performance computing for doing their product development or looking for insights or predicting the market or whatever it is. And today, we represent about 15% of the world's top 500 supercomputers. And I've repeatedly said, and I believe this completely, and I think it's becoming increasingly true, that every single supercomputer in the future will be accelerated somehow. So this is a fairly significant growth opportunity for us. The second is deep learning training, which is very, very much like high-performance computing. And you need to do computing at a very large scale. You're performing trillions and trillions of iterations. The models are getting larger and larger. Every single year, the amount of data that we're training with it is increasing. And the difference between a computing platform that's fast versus not could mean the difference between building a $20 million data center or high-performance computing servers for training to $200 million. And so the money that we save and the capability we provide is really, the value's incredible. The third segment and this is the segment that you just mentioned, has to do with inference, which is when you're done with developing this network, you had to put it down to the hyperscale datacenters to support the billions and billions of queries that consumers make to the Internet every day. And this is a brand-new market for us. 100% of the world's inference is done on CPUs today. We announced very recently, this last quarter in fact, that TensorRT 3 inference acceleration platform and in combination with our Tensor Core GPU instruction set architecture, we are able to speed up networks by a factor of 100. Now the way to think about that is, imagine whatever amount of workload that you got, if you can speed up using our platform by a factor of 100, how much you can save. The other way to think about that is because the amount of -- the networks are getting larger and larger and they're so complex now. And we know that every network on the planet will run on an architecture because they were trained on our architecture today. And so whether it's CNNs or RNNs or GANs or auto encoders or all of the variations of those, irrespective of the precision that you need to support. The size of the network, we have the ability to support them; and so you could either scale out your hyperscale datacenters to support more traffic or you can reduce your cost tremendously or simultaneously, both. The fourth segment of our data center is providing all of that capability, what I just mentioned, whether it's HPC, training or inference and turning it inside out and making it available in the public cloud. There are thousands of startups now that are in -- are startup because of AI. Everybody recognizes the importance of this new computing model. And as a result of this new tool, this new capability, all these unsolvable problems in the past are now interestingly solvable. And so you can see startups cropping up all over the west, all over the east and there's just -- there are thousands of them. And these companies don't either -- would rather not use their scarce financial resources to go build high-performance computing centers or they don't have the skill to be able to build out a high-performance platform the way these Internet companies can. And so these cloud providers, cloud platforms are just a fantastic resource for them. So it get rented by the hour. We created in conjunction with that, and I mentioned that all the service providers have taken it to market. In conjunction with that, we created a registry in the cloud that containerizes these really complicated software stacks. Every one of these soft -- frameworks with the different versions of our GPUs and different acceleration of layers and different optimization techniques, we've containerized all of that for every single version and every single type of framework in the marketplace. And we put that up in the registry -- cloud registry called the [indiscernible] GPU Cloud. And so all you had to do was download that into the cloud service provider that we've got certified in Tesla 4. And with just one click, you are doing deep learning. And then, the last -- and so that's the cloud service providers. If you -- the way to guess that -- estimate that is there are obviously tens of billions of dollars being invested in these AI startups. And some large proportion of their investment fund raiser will ultimately had to go towards high-performance computing, whether they build it themselves or they rented it in the clouds. And so I think that's a multibillion opportunity for us. And then lastly, this is probably the largest of all the opportunities which is the vertical industries. Whether it's automotive companies that are developing their supercomputers to get ready for self-driving cars or in healthcare companies that are now taking advantage of artificial intelligence to do better diagnostics of -- diagnosis of disease, to manufacturing companies to -- for in-line inspection, to robotics, large logistics companies, Colette mentioned earlier DHL. But the way to think about that is all of these planning -- all of these companies doing planning to deliver products to you through this large network of delivery systems, it is the world's largest plane [indiscernible] and whether it's Uber or DD or Lyft or Amazon or DHL or UPS or FedEx, they all have high-performance computing problems that are now moving to deep learning. And so those are really exciting opportunities for us, and so the last one is just the vertical industries. I mean, all of these segments were now in a position to start addressing because we've put our GPUs in the cloud, all of our OEMs are in the process of taking these platforms out to market. And we have the ability now to address high-performance computing and deep learning training as well as inference using one common platform. And so I think the -- we've been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers. And I think this is just the beginning of it all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I had a question on your Gaming seasonality into Q4. It's usually up a bit. I was wondering, do you see, I guess, drivers that would drive the lack of normal seasonal trends given how strong it's been sequentially and year-over-year? And I guess as a related question, do you see your Volta volumes in Q4 exceeding Q3?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. There's -- I'll answer the last one first and then work towards the first one. I think the guidance that we provided, we feel comfortable with. But if you think about Volta, it is just in the beginning of the ramp and it's going to ramp into the market opportunities I talked about. And so my hope is that we continue to grow. And there's every evidence that the markets that we serve, that we're addressing with Volta is -- are very large markets. And so there's a lot of reasons to be hopeful about the future growth opportunities for Volta. We've primed the pump. So cloud service providers are either announce the availability of Volta or they announce the soon availability of Volta. They're all racing to get Volta through cloud because customers are clamoring for it. The OEMs are -- we've primed the pump with OEMs and some of them are sampling now and some of them are racing to get Volta into production in the marketplace. And so I think the foundation, the demand is there. The urgent need for accelerated computing is there because Moore's Law is not scaling anymore. And then we've primed the pump. So the demand is there, there is a need, the need is there; and the foundations for getting Volta to market is primed. With respect to Gaming, what drives our Gaming business? Remember, our Gaming business is sold one at a time to millions and millions of people. And what drives our Gaming business is several things. As you know, e-sports is incredibly, incredibly vibrant and what drives -- the reason why e-sports is so unique is because people want to win and having better gear helps. The latency that they expect is incredibly low and performance drives down latency and they want to be able to react as fast as they can. People want to win and they want to make sure that the gear that they use is not the reason why they didn't win. The second growth driver for us this content, the quality of content. And boy, if you look at Call of Duty or Destiny 2 or PUB G, the content just looks amazing. The AAA content just looks amazing. And one of the things that's really unique about video games is that in order to enjoy the content and the fidelity of the content, the quality of the production value at its fullest, you need the best gear. It's very different than streaming video, it's very different than watching movies where streaming videos, it is what it is. But for video games, of course, it is not. And so when AAA titles comes out in the later part of the year, it helps to drive platform adoption. And then lastly, increasingly, social is becoming a huge part of the growth dynamics of Gaming. People are -- they recognize how beautiful these video games are. And so they want to share their brightest moments with people, they want to share the levels they discover, they want to take pictures of the amazing graphics that's inside. And it is one of the primary drivers, the leading driver, in fact, of YouTube and people watching other people play video games, these broadcasters. And now, with our Ansel, the world's first in-game virtual reality and surround and digital camera, we have the ability to take pictures and show that with people. And so I think all of these different drivers are helping our Gaming business. And I'm optimistic about Q4. It looks like it's going to be a great quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: I was hoping to speak in a near-term and a longer-term question. On the near term, you talked about the health on demand side for Volta. Curious if you're seeing any sort of restrictions on the supply side, whether it's wafers or access to high-bandwidth memory, et cetera. And then the longer-term question really revolves around CUDA. You've talked about that as being a sustainable competitive advantage for you guys entering the year. And now that we've moved beyond HPC and hyperscale training to more into inference and GPU as a service and you've posted GTC around the world, curious if you could extrapolate on how you're seeing that advantage and how you've seen it evolve over the year and how you're thinking about CUDA as the AI standard?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks a lot, C.J. Well, everything that we build is complicated. Volta is the single largest processor that humanity has ever made, at 21 billion transistors, 3D packaging, the fastest memories on the planet and all of that in a couple of hundred watts which basically says it's the most energy-efficient form of computing that the world has ever known. And one single Volta replaces hundreds of CPUs. And so it's energy-efficient, it saves an enormous amount of money and it gets this job done really, really fast which is just one of the reasons why GPU-accelerated computing is so popular now. With respect to the outlook for our architecture. As you know, we are a one architecture company. And it's so vitally important. And the reason for that is because there are so much software and so much tools created on top of this one architecture. On the inference side -- on the training side, we have a whole stack of software and optimizing compilers and numeric libraries that are completely optimized for one architecture called CUDA. On the inference side, the optimizing compilers that takes these large, huge computational graphs that come out of all of these frameworks, and these computational graphs are getting larger and larger and their numerical precision differs from one type of network to another -- from one type of application to another. Your numerical precision requirements for a self-driving car where lives are at stake to detecting where counting the number of people crossing the street, counting something versus trying to track -- detect and track something very subtle in all the weather conditions, is a very, very different problem. And so the numeric -- the types of networks are changing all the time, they're getting larger all the time. The numerical precision is different for different applications. And we have different computing -- compute performance levels as well as energy availability levels that these inference compilers are likely to be some of the most complex software in the world. And so the fact that we have one singular architecture to optimize for, whether it's HPC for numeric, molecular dynamics and computational chemistry and biology and astrophysics, all the way to training to inference gives us just enormous leverage. And that's the reason why NVIDIA could be an 11,000 people company. And arguably, performing at a level that is 10x that. And the reason for that is because we have one singular architecture that's -- that is accruing benefits over time instead of three, four, five different architectures where your software organization is broken up into all these different, small subcritical mass pieces. And so it's a huge advantage for us. And it's a huge advantage for the industry. So people who support CUDA know that the next-generation architecture will just get a benefit and go for the ride that technology advancement provides them and affords them, okay? So I think it's an advantage that is growing exponentially, frankly. And I'm excited about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Congratulations on the strong results and the consistent execution. Jen-Hsun, in the last few months, we have seen a lot of announcements from Intel, from Xylinx and others describing other approaches to the AI market. My question is how does the customer make that decision, whether to use a GPUs or an SPGA or an ASIC, right? What is -- what can remain a competitive differentiator over the longer term? And does your position in the trail market also then maybe give you a leg up when they consider solution for the inference part of the problem?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thank you, Vivek. So first of all, we have one architecture and people know that our commitment to our GPUs, our commitment to CUDA, our commitment to all of the software stacks that run on top of our GPUs, every single one of the 500 applications, every numerical solver, every CUDA compiler, every tool chain across every single operating system in every single computing platform, we are completely dedicated to it. We support the software first long as we shall live. And as a result of that the benefits to their investment in CUDA just continues to accrue. I -- you have no idea how many people send me notes about how they literally take out their old GPU, put in a new GPU. And without lifting a finger, things got 2x, 3x, 4x faster than what they were doing before, incredible value to customers. The fact that we are singularly focused and completely dedicated to this one architecture in an unwavering way allows everybody to trust us and know that we will support it for as long as we shall live, and that is the benefit of an architectural strategy. When you have four or five different architectures to support that you offer to your customers and you ask them to pick the one that they like the best, you're essentially saying that you're not sure which one is the best. And we all know that nobody's going to be able to support five architectures forever. And as a result, something has to give and it would be really unfortunate for a customer to have chosen the wrong one. And if there's five architectures, surely, over time, 80% of them will be wrong. And so I think that our advantage is that we are singularly focused. With respect to FPGAs. I think FPGAs have their place. And we use FPGAs here at NVIDIA to prototype things and -- but FPGAs is a chip design. It's able to be a chip for -- it's incredibly good at being a flexible substrate to be any chip, and so that's it's advantage. Our advantage is that we have a programming environment. And writing software is a lot easier than designing chips. And if it's within the domain that we focus on, like for example, we're not focused on network packet processing but we are very focused on deep learning. We are very focused on high performance and parallel numeric analysis. If we're focused on those domains, our platform is really quite unbeatable. And so that's how you think through that. I hope that was helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Colette, on the last call, you mentioned that crypto was $150 million in the OEM line in the July quarter. Can you quantify how much crypto was in the October quarter? And expectations in the January quarter directionally? And just longer-term, why should we think that crypto won't impact the gaming demand in the future? If you can just talk about the steps anybody has taken with respect to having the different mode and all that?\nColette Kress: So in our results, in the OEM results, our specific crypto boards equated to about $70 million of revenue, which is the comparable to the $150 million that we saw last quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Our longer term, Atif -- well, first of all, thank you for that. The longer-term way to think about that is crypto is small for us but not 0. And I believe that crypto will be around for some time, kind of like today. There will be new currencies emerging, existing currencies would grow in value. The interest in mining these new emerging currency crypto algorithms that emerge are going to continue to happen. And so I think for some time, we're going to see that crypto will be a small but not 0, small but not 0 part of our business. The -- when you think about crypto in the context of our company overall, the thing to remember is that we're the largest GPU computing company in the world. And our overall GPU business is really sizable and we have multiple segments. And there's data center and I've already talked about the five different segments within data center. There's [indiscernible] and even that has multiple segments within it, whether it's rendering or computed design or broadcast, in a workstation, in a laptop or in a data center, the architecture is rather different. And of course, you know that we have high performance computing, you know that we have autonomous machine business, self-driving cars and robotics. And you know of course that we have gaming; and so these different segments are all quite large and growing. And so my sense is that as although crypto will be here to stay, it will remain small not zero.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Just following up on that last question. You mentioned that some of the crypto market had moved to traditional gaming. What drives that? Is there a lack of availability of the specialized crypto product? Or is it just that there's a preference driven for the gaming oriented crypto solutions?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Joe, I appreciate you asking that. Here's the reason why. So what happens is when a crypto -- when a currency -- digital currency market becomes very large, it entices somebody to build a custom ASIC for it. And of course, Bitcoin is the perfect example of that. Bitcoin is incredibly easy to design in its specialized chip form. But then what happens is a couple of different players starts to monopolize the marketplace. As a result, it chases everybody out of the mining market and it encourages a new currency to evolve, to emerge. And the new currency, the only way to get people to mine is if it's hard to mine, okay? You got to put some effort into it. However, you want a lot of people to try to mine it. And so therefore, the platform that is perfect for it, the ideal platform for digital, new emerging digital currencies turns out to be a CUDA GPU. And the reason for that is because there are several hundred million NVIDIA GPUs in the marketplace. If you want to create a new cryptocurrency algorithm, optimizing for our GPUs is really quite ideal. It's hard to do. It's hard to do, therefore, you need a lot of computation to do it. And yet there is enough GPUs in the marketplace, it's such an open platform that the ability for somebody to get in and start mining is very low barriers to entry. And so that's the cycles of these digital currencies, and that's the reason why I say that digital currency crypto usage of GPUs, crypto usage of GPUs will be small but not 0 for some time. And it's small because when it gets big, somebody will be able to build custom ASIC. But if somebody builds a custom ASIC, there will be a new emerging cryptocurrency. So ebbs and flows.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nCraig Ellis: Jen-Hsun, congratulations on data center annualizing $2 billion, it's a huge milestone. I wanted to follow-up with a question on some of your comments regarding data center partners. Because as I look back over the last five years, I just don't see any precedent for the momentum that you have in the market place right now between your server partners, white box partners, hyperscale partners that are deploying it, hosted, et cetera. And so my question is, relative to the doubling that we've seen year-on-year in each of the last two years, what does that partner expansion mean for datacenters growth? And then if I could sneak one more in, two new products just announced in the Gaming platform, the 1070 Ti and a Collector's Edition on Titan Xp. What does that mean for the gaming platform?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Craig, thanks a lot. Let's see. We have never created a product that is as broadly supported by the industries and has grown nine consecutive quarters. It has doubled year-over-year and with partnerships of the scale that we're looking at. We have just never created a product like that before. And I think the reason for that is several folds. The first is that it is true that CPU scaling has come to an end. That's just laws of physics. The end of Moore's Law is just laws of physics. And yet, the world for software development and the world -- the problems that computing can help solve is growing faster than any time before. Nobody's ever seen a large-scale planning problem like Amazon before. Nobody's ever seen a large planning problem like DD before, the number of millions of taxi rides per week is just staggering. And so nobody's ever seen large problems like these before, large-scale problems like these before; and so high performance computing and accelerated computing using GPUs has become recognized as the path forward. And so I think that that's at the highest level of the most important parameter. Second is artificial intelligence and its emergence and applications to solving problems that we historically thought were unsolvable. Solving the unsolvable problems is a real realization. I mean, this is happening across just about every industry we know, whether it's Internet service providers to healthcare, to manufacturing, to transportation, logistics. You just name it, financial services. And so I think artificial intelligence is a real tool. Deep learning is a real tool that can help solve some of the world's unsolvable problems. And I think that our dedication to high performance computing and this one singular architecture, our seven year headstart, if you will, in deep learning and our early recognition of the importance of this new computing approach, both the timing of it, the fact that it was naturally a perfect fit for the skills that we have and then the incredibly -- the incredible effectiveness of this approach, I think has really created the perfect conditions for our architecture. And so I think I really appreciate you noticing that. But this is definitely the most successful product line in the history of our company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChristopher Caso: I have a question on the automotive market and the outlook there. And interestingly, with the other segments growing as quickly as they are, auto is becoming a smaller percentage of revenue now. And certainly, the design traction seems very positive. Can you talk about the ramp in terms of when the auto revenue, when we could see that as getting back to a similar percentage of revenue? Is that growing more quickly? Do you think that is likely to happen over the next year with some of these design wins coming out? Or is that something we should be waiting for over several years?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I appreciate that, Chris. So the way to think about that is, as you know, we've really, really reduced our emphasis on infotainment even though that's the primary part of our revenues so that we could take, literally, hundreds of engineers and including the processors that we're building now, a couple of 2,000, 3,000 engineers, working on our autonomous machine and artificial intelligence platform for this marketplace to take advantage of the position we have and to go after this amazing revolution that's about to happen. I happen to believe that everything that moves will be autonomous someday. And it could be a bus, a truck, a shuttle, a car. Everything that moves will be autonomous someday; it could be a delivery vehicle, it could be little robots that are moving around warehouses, it could be delivering a pizza to you. And we felt that those -- this was such an incredibly great challenge and such a great compute problem that we decided to dedicate ourselves to it. Over the next several years, and if you look at our DRIVE PX platform today, there's over 200 companies that are working on it. 125 startups are working on it. And these companies are mapping companies, they're Tier 1s, they're OEMs, they're shuttle companies, car companies, trucking companies, taxi companies. And this last quarter, we announced an extension of our DRIVE PX platform to include DRIVE PX Pegasus which is now the world's first auto grade full [indiscernible] platform for robotaxis. And so I think our position is really excellent and the investment has proven to be one of the best ever. And so I think in terms of revenues, my expectation is that this coming year, we'll enjoy revenues as a result of the supercomputers that customers will have to buy for training their networks, for simulating the -- all these autonomous vehicles driving and developing their self-driving cars. And we'll see fairly large quantities of development systems being sold this coming year. The year after that, I think is the year when you're going to see the robotaxis ramping and our economics in every robotaxi is several thousand dollars. And then starting, I would say, late 2022, 2021, you're going to start to see the first fully automatic autonomous cars, what people call level 4 cars, starting to hit the road. And so that's kind of how I see it. Just next year is simulation environments, development systems, supercomputers. And then the year after that is robotaxis. And then a year or two after that will be all the self-driving cars.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with Canaccord Genuity.\nMatthew Ramsay: I have, I guess, a two-part question on gross margin. Colette, I remember, I don't know if maybe 3 years ago, 3.5 years ago at Analyst Day, you guys were talking about gross margins in the mid-50s and that was inclusive of the Intel payment. And now you're hitting numbers at 60% excluding that. I want to -- if you could talk a little bit about how mix of the data center business and some others drives gross margin going forward? And maybe Jen-Hsun you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned both are being such a huge chip in terms of transistor count. How you're thinking about taking costs out of that product as you ramp in into gaming next year and the effects on gross margins.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Matt, for the question. Yes, we've been on a steady stream of increasing the gross margins over the years. But this is the evolution of the entire model. The model of the value-added platforms that we sell and inclusive of the entire ecosystem of work that we do, the software that we enable in so many of these platforms that we bring to market. Datacenter is one of them; our ProVis, another one. And if you think about all of our work that we have in terms of gaming, that overall expansion of the ecosystem. So this has been continuing to increase our gross margin. Mix is more of a statement in terms of each quarter, we have a different mix in terms of our products and some of them have a little bit of seasonality. And depending on when some of those platforms come to market, we can have a mix change within some of those subsets. It's still going to be our focus as we go forward in terms of growing gross margins as best as we can. You can see in terms of our guidance into Q4 which we feel comfortable with that guidance that we will increase it as well.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. With respect to yield enhancement, the way to think about that is we do it in several ways. The first thing is I'm just incredibly proud of the technology group that we have in VLSI and they get us ready for these brand new nodes, whether it's in the process readiness, through all the circuit readiness, the packaging, the memory readiness. The readiness is so incredible -- incredibly important for us because these processors that we're creating are really, really hard. They're the largest things in the world. And so we get one shot at it. And so the team does everything they can to essentially prepare us. And by the time that we take off a product for real, we know for certain that we can build it. And so the technology team in our company is just world-class. Absolutely world-class, there's nothing like it. Then once we go into production, we get the benefit of ramping up the products. And as yields improve, we'll surely benefit from the cost. But that's not really where the focus is. I mean, in the final analysis, the real focus for us is continue to improve the software stack on top of our processors. And the reason for that is each one of our processors carry with it an enormous amount of memory and systems and networking and the whole data center. Most of our data center products, if we can improve the throughput of a data center by another 50%, or in our case, often times, we'll improve something from 2x to 4x, the way to think about that is that billion-dollar data center just improved this productivity by a factor of two. And all of the software work that we do on top of CUDA and the incredible work that we do with optimizing compilers and graph analytics, all of that stuff then all of a sudden translates to a value to our customers, not measured by dollars but measured by hundreds of millions of dollars. And that's really the leverage of accelerated computing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt.\nHans Mosesmann: Jen-Hsun, can you comment on some of the issues this week regarding Intel and their renewed interest in getting into the graphic space and their relationship at the chip level with AMD?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, thanks, Hans. There's a lot of news out there. I guess some of the things I take away, first of all, Raj leaving AMD is a great loss for AMD. And it's a recognition by Intel probably that the GPU is just incredibly, incredibly important now. And the modern GPU is not a graphics accelerator. The modern GPU, we just left the word G -- the letter G in there. But these processors are domain specific parallel accelerators. And they're enormously complex. They're the most complex processes built by anybody on the planet today. And that's the reason why IBM uses our processors for the world's largest supercomputers, that's the reason why every single cloud, every single -- every major cloud, every major server maker in the world has adopted NVIDIA GPUs. It's just incredibly hard to do. The amount of software engineer that goes on top of it is significant as well. So if you look at the way we do things, we plan a roadmap about five years out. It takes about three years to build a new generation and we build multiple GPUs at the same time. And on top of that, there's some 5,000 engineers working on system software and numeric libraries and solvers and compilers and graph analytics and cloud platforms and virtualization stacks in order to make this computing architecture useful to all of the people that we serve. And so when you think about it from that perspective, it's just an enormous undertaking. Arguably, the most significant undertaking of any processor in the world today. And that's the reason why we are able to speed up applications by a factor of 100. You don't walk in and have a new widget and a few transistors and all of a sudden, speed up applications by a factor of 100 or 50 or 20. That's just something that's inconceivable unless you do the type of innovation that we do. And then lastly, with respect to the chip that they built together, I think it goes without saying now that the energy efficiency of Pascal GeForce and the Max-Q design technology and all of the software that we created has really set a new design point for the industry. It is now possible to build a state-of-the-art gaming notebook with the most leading-edge GeForce processors and be able to deliver gaming experiences that are many times greater than a console in 4K and had that be in a laptop that's 18 millimeters thin. The combination of Pascal at Max-Q has really raised the bar. And I think that that's really the essence of it.\nOperator: Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I'll now turn the call over to you for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We have another great quarter. Gaming is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries and we're well-positioned for the holidays. AI is becoming increasingly widespread in many industries throughout the world and we're hoping to lead the way with all major cloud providers and computer makers moving to deploy Volta and we're building the future of autonomous driving. We expect robotaxis using our technology to hit the road in just a couple of years. We look forward to seeing many of you at the SE 17 this weekend. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Shawn. NVIDIA continues to fire on all cylinders. We achieved strong revenue in each of our businesses. Data center revenue grew more than 2.5 times, reflecting momentum behind artificial intelligence as we expanded our product portfolio and began shipping our new Volta platform. Overall, quarterly revenue reached a record $2.23 billion, up 56% from a year earlier, up 15% sequentially, and well above our outlook of $1.95 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q2 GPU revenue increased 59% to $1.9 billion from a year earlier. Tegra processor revenue doubled to $333 million. OEM revenue reached $251 million, reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs, partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel. Let's start with our gaming platform. Gaming revenue was $1.19 billion, up 52% year on year and up 15% from Q1. This reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports. Gamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs, with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 series products. Our new Max-Q design approach, enabling gaming notebooks that are thinner, lighter, and faster, is finding a strong market. Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs. Quality games continue to drive GPU sales. At the E3 Gaming Expo in L.A., we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running in 4K on PCs, which drew rave reviews. Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty: WWII, Star Wars: Battlefront 2, and Middle Earth: Shadow of War. We're also seeing the rise of independent titles that have become runaway hits, most notably, a new last man standing shooter called PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. Gaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of e-sports. This week's biggest sporting event isn't playing out at Dodger Stadium or Wrigley Field. It's in Seattle at the International Dota 2 Championships. The $24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf's richest event, the U.S. Open. For the third straight year, GeForce GTX is Dota 2's official graphics platform. GPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity, or Ethereum. We serve a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board, as seen in our OEM sales, and some with GeForce GTX boards. Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies. Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew $235 million, up 10% from a year ago, up 15% sequentially, on the demand for high-end real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations. Demand was especially strong in education, both among universities and large public school districts, as well as in the financial sector and defense industry. And last week at SIGGRAPH's computer graphics show, we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation. This new OptiX 5.0 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing when running on our DGX rendering appliance that provides the rendering capability of 150 standard dual-CPU servers. We also introduced NVIDIA eGPU system solutions. This creates a new category for our platforms, using an external chassis to expand access to Titan Xp and Quadro GPUs for the 25 million content creators using standard notebook PCs. Next, data center, revenue of $416 million was up more than 2.5 times from a year ago. This growth, shared across AI, deep learning, high-performance computing, and GRID, is particularly notable, given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal generation GPUs. Looking ahead, we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs. V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter's GPU Technology Conference [GTC]. It provides 10 times the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor, widely outpacing Moore's Law. Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the CVPR [Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition] and ICML [International Conference on Machine Learning] conferences. We made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning application. It delivers 100 times faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation, and it supports the industry's two most common AI frameworks, Google TensorFlow and Facebook's Caffe. We also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI. Among them, Baidu has aligned with us on Volta. It's bringing this new architecture to its cloud and optimizing the Paddle Paddle open source deep learning framework for Volta. Volkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization. And we announced a new partner program with Taiwan's top ODMs, including Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron, to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture, GPU computing technologies, and design guidelines. Demand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer, as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications. Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs. We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers, with 1,000-plus in the pipeline. Our HPC business remained strong. The new Green500 list showed that the world's 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators. The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology's TSUBAME3.0 system. It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt, 50% higher efficiency than the previous leader, helping to point the way to exascale supercomputing. Momentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business. Among key wins was Amazon Web Services, whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. In automotive, revenue grew to $142 million, up 19% year over year. We announced important new partnerships based on our DRIVE PX AI platform, which is being used by more than 225 car and truck makers, Tier 1 suppliers, HD mapping companies, startups, and research institutions. Additionally, production cars using our technology continued to make their way into the market. Audi announced last month that the 2019 A8 will be the first car to feature NVIDIA's powered Level 3 autonomous technology. This means that under certain specific use cases, it will be able to be driven by its own software without monitoring from the driver. Our DRIVE PX platform is already on the road in Tesla Motors' full line of cars, including the new Model 3, which uses the second-generation Tesla Autopilot. This quarter, we also announced that Toyota selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX for their next-generation autonomous cars. Volvo, long a byword for safety and value, and Autoliv selected DRIVE PX for self-driving cars targeted to hit the market by 2021. ZF and HELLA have selected the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform for their line of autonomous vehicle products. And Baidu announced that its Project Apollo open source self-driving platform for the China market will use NVIDIA DRIVE PX. You'll be hearing more from us in the months ahead at regional GTCs that we will be conducting in Beijing, Munich, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Washington DC, and Tokyo. Now turning to the rest of the Q2 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were 58.4% and 58.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $614 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $533 million, up 19% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $688 million. Non-GAAP operating income was $773 million, doubling from a year ago. GAAP net income was $583 million, non-GAAP net income $638 million, also doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we have paid $758 million in share repurchases and $166 million in quarterly cash dividends. Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $2.35 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 58.8% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $672 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $2 million, inclusive of additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. Please be sure to limit your questions to one or two. Operator, will you please poll for the first question? Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question, maybe a clarification on a question and a question after that on the data center. On the clarification side, we have seen several quarters where your data center business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time the growth was somewhat more modest, and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that. And then the bigger question is, Jensen, it seems the data center market is bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side. What are you doing to make sure that the balance stays in your favor as the market matures from here?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: So first of all, Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year over year, and we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last generation processor \u2013 Volta is 100 times faster than Kepler, 100 times faster than Kepler just four years ago, and Kepler was already 10 times faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production. The application of data center \u2013 you asked a larger question about data center. Data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there's a very well accepted notion now that GPU acceleration of servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application, and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in number of servers. And so the value proposition and the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary. There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there's training and there's high-performance computing. There's cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this quarter. And then there are also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production, and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video, consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing it with their friends. And there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time, and each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be \u2013 you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge. The one area where you're talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this. After four generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it's in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I've ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPUs is essentially a TPU that does a lot more. And we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud. And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer. It's not an appliance. It's not a toaster. It's not a lightbulb. It's not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning, and our GPUs have evolved into something that can be absolutely world-class at TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like things went very well on the cryptocurrency side. That market has not had a lot of history, but the little history it has, has had some volatility. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about managing that volatility. And a broader question on this topic is, do you consider cryptocurrency or other blockchain applications on par with your other four big markets?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks. Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time it will become quite large. It is very clear that new currencies will come to market, and it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography. And as these new algorithms are being developed, the GPU is really quite ideal for it. And so this is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will emerge from time to time, and the GPU is really quite great for it. What we've done, our strategy is to stay very, very close to the market. We understand its dynamics really well. And we offer the coin miners a special coin-mining SKU. And this product configuration \u2013 this GPU configuration is optimized for mining. We stay very close to the market. We know its every single move and we know its dynamics. And then last thing that I can say is that the larger of a GPU company you are, the greater ability you could absorb the volatility. And so between the combination of the fact that we have GPUs at just about every single price point, we have such incredibly efficient designs that we're so close to the marketplace. And because we have such large volumes, we have the ability to rock and roll with this market as it goes. But this is an important market that likely will continue to grow over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I have a question on some of the numbers. So Q2 revenue came in roughly about $250 million above your guide. Can you confirm what some of the drivers were to the upside relative to your guidance? Was it all cryptocurrency, or was it a combination of multiple things? And related to that, for your Q3 guide I think you are guiding revenue up about $120 million sequentially. What are the puts and takes here on a sequential basis? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure, let's see. First of all, we actually gave a really great guidance last quarter, and we beat it by $250 million. And the $250 million you could see in our \u2013 we categorized under the OEM SKUs basically the cryptocurrency SKUs. And that, if you reverse-engineered it out, I think is approximately $150 million. And we serve the vast \u2013 I would say the large majority of the cryptocurrency demand out of that specialized products. There are still small miners that buy GeForces here and there, and that probably also increased the demand of GeForces. There were a lot of shortages all over the world. And as we go into this quarter, there's still cryptocurrency mining demand that we know is out there. And based on our analytics and understanding of the marketplace, there will be some amount of demand for the foreseeable future. But it's also the case that there were gamers whose needs and demands were not filled last quarter. The second quarter is an important part of the year for us. GeForce is in an incredibly great strategic position. After all of the numerous product launches that we've seen from other players, it's very, very clear that the GeForce product lineup is absolutely the best in the world. And the second half is going to see some very exciting titles. You've got Destiny 2. You have Call of Duty from Activision. You have Star Wars: Battlefront from EA. These are going be blockbusters, and we're expecting them to do incredibly well. We also know that a game that came out of nowhere \u2013 and this is one of the things that's really great about the video game market, you never know where the next amazing new title is going to come from. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, it's really essentially Survivor meets Hunger Games. How could that not be a fun game? So they've done incredibly well. And so I think the market dynamic is really vibrant for the second half of the year, and we have a really great position. With respect to our guidance, the way to think about our guidance, we gave a good guidance and we're comfortable with our guidance. And we know that the dynamics in our business, our data center position is quite exciting. We know that our gaming business is vibrant and our position is excellent. We saw growth across all of our product segments. And we'll just see how it turns out at the end of next quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could tell us how much Volta contributed to the data center revenue in the quarter. And what are your expectations for that ramp trajectory into the second half? The reason I ask is when I look at gross margins, they're fine, but it doesn't look like the Volta ramp is driving upside to that number. So I'm trying get some feeling for the trajectory of that ramp.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: First of all, it's very difficult to reverse-engineer from the first ramp of Volta any impact on gross margins, and the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you're still trying to stabilize yield. There are a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas, and Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it. The leap generationally for deep learning is quite extraordinary. And so we're expecting Volta to be very, very successful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore.\nC. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: I guess a follow-up question to that on the Volta transition and now that that is ramping in high-volume manufacturing and considering the pretty large uplift in die size there, I'm curious how you're thinking about ASP uplift over time, and whether you would expect that to drive a reacceleration in growth in data center looking into the second half of the calendar year.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs [Network Interface Cards] and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars. And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing cost is quite extraordinary. These are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate it, is probably in the several hundred dollars to close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value-add ultimately ends up. And so I guess the pricing \u2013 your question relates is pricing. We expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta. And then your second question I think is related to acceleration. The data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. There are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing. Every single OEM and every single cloud service provider now supports NVIDIA GPUs and offer video GPUs, and Volta is going be the engine that serves them. So I'm expecting a lot of good things from Volta.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my question, congratulations on the strong results. Even if you exclude the OEM (31:10) contribution, you have beaten the Street expectations. My question is on auto. You've announced a very strong pipeline of auto partnerships this year. Can you just talk about when do you expect acceleration in auto sales? And are there any other ways you can monetize your auto partnerships and maybe through licensing of software stacks? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure, thanks a lot, Atif. The roadmap for auto looks like this. For this year and next, what you should see is development partnerships that we have with a growing number of car companies, and they're reflected in NRE projects, development systems, and purchasing of our AI supercomputers like DGX. And so for the next I would say this year and the vast majority of next year, that's what you should expect from the autonomous driving perspective. Starting next year, you're going to start to see robot taxis start to come to the road. We're working with a handful, maybe I guess about six or seven really exciting robot taxi projects around the world. And you could see them start to go into a prototype or beta testing starting now, and then next year you'll see a lot more of them. And starting 2019, you'll see them go into real commercial services. And so those are robot taxis, what some in the industry call Level 5s, basically driverless cars. And then the fully autonomous drivered cars, driven cars, branded cars will start hitting the road around 2020 and 2021. So the way to think about it is this year and next is really about development. Starting next year and the following year is robot taxis. And then 2021 to forward you're going to see a lot of Level 4s.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I wanted to actually ask about the ProVis business. That business continues to grow faster than I had expect it to, and you had real good quarter there. Can you talk about what's driving that and what the trajectory of that business looks like?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure. Our Pro business, call it roughly nearly $1 billion. It grew 8% last year. It grew 8% the year before that, maybe a little bit less, and this year it grew about 10%, maybe a little faster. The way to think about that business is it's really a platform for design, digital design of all kinds. And it's designing movies, designing cars, designing products, people designing websites. Anybody who's doing digital design could really benefit from a Quadro platform. It's very software-intensive. It's certified with every major computer-aided design package. It's certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that was designed five years ago 10 years from now. And so if anything were to happen to a product or a plane or a ship or a building, the level of certainty in your data integrity is going be complete. And so the software intensity is high, and our platform is recognized all over the world as the industry standard. The growth opportunity for Quadro are several, and it's starting to kick in. And I'm rather optimistic about its future growth as well. One of them is photorealistic rendering. We now have the ability to use our artificial intelligence and ray tracing technology in combination, called OptiX 5.0, that we just announced at SIGGRAPH. That allows you to visualize photorealistic rendering practically interactively, and it's just an amazing thing to watch. Second, we now have a new system called an external GPU system. That's a partnership between the work that we did with Intel and all of our partners in the ecosystem by taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 and the new external GPU-capable Windows system. You can now have an external system connect to Thunderbolt and basically our GPU is outside the laptop. And so for some 25 million \u2013 20 million users of thin and light notebooks, you can now have the ability to have a GPU as well and get a boost in your productivity like you've never seen before. And so you can now have thin notebooks and still have the benefit of our GPUs. And so that's a new market for us. We're going to see virtual reality do quite well, especially in design. And we partnered with HP recently to do an industrial version of a backpack that allows designers to be able to freely roam within their design space and completely in virtual reality. So there's a variety of growth drivers in that business that I'm quite excited about.\nOperator: Your next question comes there the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the very good execution and capitalizing on the crypto opportunity. Jensen, I wanted to start just connecting a few dots. You had mentioned that there was significant upside from that opportunity. And we've seen through checks that we can do via public means that demand was very strong in the quarter. And as I look ahead at the guidance for the fiscal third quarter, it's up 5% when I think normally it would be up in the low double digits. So can you talk about how comfortable you are with your supply availability here, and if demand was there for double-digit growth if you'd be able to achieve that? And then, Colette, one for you, the OpEx guidance setup, I think it's $37 million quarter on quarter, more than we've seen the last few quarters. Can you just bin out what some of the bigger drivers for that increase are? Thanks, team.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure, thanks a lot. So first of all, to answer that question, I would say there are three factors. The first factor is our strategic position. Our competitive lineup is probably the best it's ever been, better than last year even, which was incredibly strong, better than the year before that because it was incredibly strong. I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever. And so I think number one is our strategic position. The second, if the demand were there in the second half with respect to \u2013 from a perspective of gaming demand and if there's any residual crypto demand, we will surely be able to serve it. And then lastly, the factors related to our guidance, our guidance is we're comfortable with our guidance. We're happy with our guidance, and we want to have an opportunity to come back and give you an update in Q3.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: And, Craig, on our second question regarding the OpEx guidance in Q3, generally our guidance and actuals as we move into Q3 is usually a little stronger, and it's consistent with our normal annual compensation increase that happens in Q3. And also keep in mind, we are expected to move into our new headquarter building within Q3. And underlining our overall growth in investments is our hiring and focus in terms of on AI, autonomous driving, as well as gaming. All of these factors contribute to that with about a 19% year-over-year growth rate in terms of what we're targeting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to clarify some earlier comments with regard to Volta and data center. Is it correct to interpret your comments to mean that some customers may have tended to delay purchases as you went through the quarter as they're waiting for Volta given the stronger performance gains for that? And if that's the case, if I've got that right, now that Volta is fully ramped, do you expect that to drive stronger growth rates as you go through the second half?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: The answer to your first question is yes. Volta was a giant leap. It's got 120 teraflops. Another way to think about that is eight of them in one node is essentially one petaflops, which puts it among the top 20 fastest supercomputers on the planet. And the entire world's top 500 supercomputers are only 700 petaflops. And with eight Voltas in one box, we're doing artificial intelligence that represents one of them. So Volta is just a gigantic leap for deep learning and it's such a gigantic leap for processing that \u2013 and we announced it at GTC, if you recall, which is practically right at the beginning of the quarter. And so the transition was not insignificant, and it was that the team just executed flawlessly. I'm so proud of the team. They executed the most complex processor that's ever been built. And working with our teams, working with our partners at TSMC and Samsung and all of our package partners still, and they just did a great job for us, and so the team did great. Now looking forward, there's a whole bunch of growth drivers for our data center business. Deep learning is \u2013 training is a growth driver. Cloud computing, high-performance computing is a growth driver, and we have new growth drivers with inferencing. And so I'm pretty excited about our prospects going into the age of \u2013 the generation of Volta. In terms of the guidance and what we expect, I think our dynamics are really positive. And so we've just got to \u2013 we're happy with the guidance, and let's give you an update at the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\nWilliam Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results. Jensen, you've had a couple questions already about the pace of growth in data center in the second half from Volta, but I'm thinking a little bit further out. At GTC, you highlighted this $30 billion TAM opportunity by 2020. And when we look at the charts that you've published about your expectation for XFLOPS, the number of XFLOPS required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020, it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time. But naturally, the Street is contemplating decelerating growth for data center. People don't expect things to grow 150-plus percent forever. So can you comment as to the growth trajectory beyond maybe the very near term in that business? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I think at the highest level, the way to think about that is data-intensive computing, whether it's deep learning or high-performance computing, the GPU is just phenomenal at it. NVIDIA's CUDA GPU was, after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it's just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you're basically saying that it takes 10 times fewer servers to do the same job, or you could do 10 times as much work in the same amount of servers. So the value proposition is really quite great. The applications that we serve is really diverse now. It used to be just high-performance computing and supercomputing. But the number of applications we serve in Internet service providers, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, transportation, the number of data-intensive applications and industries that need them is really growing very fast. And so how fast does that \u2013 what does that imply in terms of long-term growth? It's hard to say. But first principles would suggest that every single data center in the world will be GPU-accelerated someday. And I've always believed that, and I believe that even more today. Because I believe that in the future, this new computing model that we all finally call AI is going be a highly data-intensive business model, and the GPU is the ideal computing model for that. So I'm not exactly sure if that completely answers your question, and partly because I'm not exactly sure. I just know that on first principles, the computing architecture is ideal. There's every evidence that every single data center and every single OEM and every single Internet service provider is jumping on this architecture and jumping on Volta. And I believe that AI is going be the future of computing. And so somewhere between those beliefs and executing the business is the truth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.\nHans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Hey, Jensen, can you give us an update in terms of how the new platforms and servers may have impacted the business in the data center with Purley launching here recently and the upcoming EPYC? As a follow-on, when can we expect Volta in the consumer gaming market? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: That's a good question, Hans, and it's a good observation. Because Purley, I didn't know if everybody understood that code name, but Purley is a new motherboard, a new platform for Intel servers, and the CPU is Skylake. It's an excellent server platform. And obviously, every OEM and every service provider was waiting for the launch of that, and it officially launched in the middle of this quarter. And so did it affect the rollout of new servers based on GPUs? It probably did, and surely it did. But now that it's ramped, it's a successful ramp. Every single cloud provider and every single OEM is now fully geared up to take that server to market, and they all have GPU options. Every single OEM in the world now and every cloud provider and every ODM now has NVIDIA GPU chassis and platforms, whether it's in one GPU in 1U to eight GPUs in a supercomputing configuration. And so the number of options of ways to enjoy NVIDIA GPUs is really quite countless now. Volta for gaming, we haven't announced anything. And all I can say is that our pipeline is filled with some exciting new toys for the gamers, and we have some really exciting new technology to offer them in the pipeline. But for the holiday season for the foreseeable future, I think Pascal is just unbeatable. It's just the best thing out there. And everybody who's looking forward to playing Call of Duty or Destiny 2, if they don't already have one, should run out and get themselves a Pascal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had two high- level ones. First, since you commented on cryptocurrency and blockchain, so when decentralized applications begin to take off and we see people essentially renting out parallel processing, how are you guys going to essentially be able to tell what products are being used in a lease model versus what's being used in gaming, et cetera?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: First of all, it's not really possible because our GPUs are all architecturally compatible, which at some level is one of our strengths. There are hundreds of millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the world, and they're all CUDA compatible, and they're all 100% CUDA compatible. And we're so rigorous and so disciplined about ensuring their compatibility that for developers it's really a wonderful platform. However, we're thoughtful about how we configure the GPUs so that they're best for the applications. Some applications would like to have the maximum amount of performance in a few nodes. Some would like to have the maximum amount of performance within 30 watts. Some would like to have the maximum amount of flexibility with all of the I/O and connectors and all the display connectors. Some people like to have multi-GPUs and that they have the ability to configure them together. And so every market has a slightly different need, and we have to understand the market needs and understand what it is that the customers are looking for, and configure something that is best for them.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it, thank you, and just one small one on a follow-up. Do you guys have an estimate on how fast the neural network is growing right now relative to a year ago?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Let's see. A neural net in terms of complexity is approximately \u2013 not quite, but approximately doubling every year. And this is one of the exciting things about artificial intelligence. In no time in my history of looking at computers in the last 35 years have we ever seen a double exponential where the GPU computing model, our GPUs are essentially increasing in performance by approximately three times each year. In order to be 100 times in just four years, we have to increase overall system performance by a factor of three, by over a factor of three every year. And yet on the other hand, on top of it, the neural network architecture and the algorithms that are being developed are improving in accuracy by about twice each year. And so object recognition accuracy is improving by twice each year, or the error rate is decreasing by half each year. And speech recognition is improving by a factor of two each year. And so you've got these two exponentials that are happening, and it's pretty exciting. That's one of the reasons why AI is moving so fast.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. On the data center, it was slightly below the Street number. I know it's not your number, but I think we've gotten used to you surpassing the Street number by a wide margin. I'm wondering if you can just talk about in the July quarter the three sub-segments and if they came in as expected. And as you look to October, maybe you can talk about what kind of growth you're looking for, for that segment. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I'm not sure I understand the question. Colette, do you? If you understand, go ahead and answer.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: So in discussing how we did versus our guidance, again, we overshot our overall guidance for Q2. Part of that was the cryptocurrency. And your question was more around the data center and the data center number. We set out with a good amount of work ahead of us to transition to Volta within the quarter. We're very pleased with that result and the overall year-over-year growth that we accomplished in terms of the data center. We always have different ranges across the organization and across the different businesses, but we don't have specifics in terms of our guidance nor did we provide specific guidance in terms of on the data center.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company.\nRobert Mertens - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Robert Mertens on behalf of Raji. Congratulations and thank you for taking my question. I guess I wanted to get a little more clarity towards your automotive division. I didn't know if you broke out rough percentages about the near-term growth between infotainment and these AS or autonomous vehicle systems. And then as a follow-up in the autonomous systems, how you're pricing between the different levels, if that's mainly just the GPUs, or if the software is baked in there as well?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Our GPUs are useless without software, I'll start from the back and work forward. Our GPUs are useless without software, and the reason for that is because otherwise each one of the markets, whether it's playing games or professional visualization or high-performance computing, doing molecular dynamics computation or doing seismic processing, or perceiving the three-dimensional world around the car and reasoning about where it is and trying to figure out how to drive, all of that software is very, very different. What we do is there's a core in our company. The core architecture is a GPU core. However, the configuration of the products and the chips and the systems are very different from market to market. So somebody asked me earlier, the gentleman asked me about cryptocurrency. That configuration is very, very different than a gaming configuration, which is different than a high-performance computing configuration, and it's different from our inferencing configuration and it's different from our self-driving car configuration. And so the chips are designed to be different, even though they're architecturally identical. And then the systems are designed to be market-specific and application-specific. And the software on top of it is super, super application-specific. And that's one of the reasons why our company is increasingly differentiated from a components company and what we call a platform company. Each one of these platforms that we bring to market are very, very different, even though at its core, this data-intensive parallel computing architecture called CUDA is essential among all of them. We don't break out the automotive from the rest of the Tegra business. The Tegra business consists of basically three parts at the moment. One major component of it is the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and it's just doing incredibly well. I'm so happy for Nintendo because they're risk takers. They're innovators. They're not influenced by what other people do, and they're original thinkers. And I just love the way they invented the Switch and the way they've taken it to market. I'm so happy for them. And it's doing really well. The second major component is our self-driving car platforms, and a lot of it still is infotainment systems. Our infotainment system is going to evolve into an AI cockpit product line. We initially started with autonomous driving. But you probably heard me say at GTC that our future infotainment systems will basically turn your cockpit or turn your car into an AI. So your whole car will become an AI. It will talk to you. It will know where you are. It knows who's in the cabin. And if there are potential things to be concerned about around the car, it might even just tell you in natural language. And so the entire car will become an AI. We announced at CES a partnership with Daimler, and they talked about the work that we're doing together in the next-generation car how we're going bring AI to the car. And that's our first visible, highly visible project, and there are others that we're working on. And then the future projects, starting from end of next year with robot taxis, and starting with 2020 the autonomous cars, fully autonomous cars, you're going to see the rest of that come online, and that's a major component of Tegra. And then the last component, the third component, major component I would say is AI at the edge. That's the next major revolution. And we have a new product line that we announced about a year ago. It's called Jetson. Jetson is just an amazing little AI computer. And if you want to do deep learning at the edge, whether it's really, really clever cameras for smart and safe cities, to traffic lights that can now monitor traffic, Jetson AI at the edge is going be the next growth opportunity for us. And those three major segments make up essentially the Tegra business. We haven't split each one of them out separately, but one of these days we'll consider doing that.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.\nTing Pong Gabriel Ho - BMO Capital Markets (United States): This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish, thanks for taking my question. I think last year at this time, on the data center business, you disclosed I think a high level of growth for your cloud business. Your deep learning business was about half, and then a third HPC. I was wondering. As you're ramping Volta, how should we think about maybe the mix as you're entering the second half of the year between the PC/cloud and maybe the rest of the business for the data center?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Ambrish (sic) [Gabriel], that's a good question. Partly I'm not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application like Netflix, and it will be virtualized. They'll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID. I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, healthcare, finance will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use AI and some of them will use traditional first principle physics-based algorithms. And it's hard to say exactly what the split is going to be. My guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that, but you're going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computation \u2013 the reason why we're so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms have the combination of both. Inside the card, we don't just use deep learning. We use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms including deep learning. And we're seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so that segment of the marketplace is hard to predict. And then there's just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly some of them are video. The amount of traffic that's going to be inferenced using deep learning is going be quite explosive. It's hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these, but I think on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges, and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient, and that the GPU with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a GPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we're just super-enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it's going contribute in the near term in percentages is going be hard to guess.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Okay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We're seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going all in on AI and jumping onto our new Volta GPU. Enterprises and giant industries from transportation to healthcare to manufacturing to financial services have an awakened to the power of AI. And the growing pipeline of the NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer is a great indicator. The next revolution of AI will be at the edge, and the most visible impactful evidence will be the autonomous vehicle. Our strategy is to build a ground-up deep learning platform for self-driving cars, and that has put us in pole position to lead the charge. And in gaming, which is actually the first consumer AI application, we have a great strategic position in this growing market. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity ahead. We can make an amazing impact on the future of the world. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to giving you another update next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Shawn. We had a strong start to the year. Highlighting our record first quarter was a near tripling of data center revenue, reflecting surging interest in artificial intelligence. Overall, quarterly revenue reached $1.94 billion, up 48% from the year earlier, down 11% sequentially and above our outlook of $1.9 billion. Growth remained broad-based, with year-on-year gains in each of our four platforms, gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 45% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier, and Tegra processor revenue more than doubled to $332 million. And we recognized the remaining $43 million in revenue from our Intel agreement. Let's start with our gaming platforms. Gaming revenue in the first quarter was $1.03 billion, up 49% year on year. Gamers continue to show great interest in the Pascal-based GPUs, including gaming notebooks. Our Tegra gaming platform also did extremely well. Demand remained healthy for our enthusiast class GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, introduced nearly a year ago. It was complemented this past quarter with the GTX 1080 Ti, which runs 35% faster and was launched at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The GTX 1080 Ti is designed to handle the demands of 4K gaming and high-end VR experiences. Typical of many supportive reviews, Ars Technica stated it is undoubtedly a fantastic piece of engineering, cool, quiet, and without rival. Those that demand the absolute very best in cutting-edge graphics need look no further. We also released the next generation of our TITAN-class product, the TITAN Xp, designed for enthusiasts and researchers who demand extreme performance. Gaming continues to be driven by the headlong growth in e-sports. The newest title, Overwatch, added 30 million gamers in its first year. GeForce was the graphics platform of choice at all the top e-sports tournaments, including the finals of the big four international competitions. With apologies to the start of the baseball season, e-sports is now as popular among U.S. male millennials as America's favorite pastime. More people watch gaming than HBO, Netflix, ESPN, and Hulu combined. GeForce sales remained underpinned by the steady stream of AAA titles coming onto market, which continued to push for more chip GPU performance. In the months ahead, we'll see a series of highly anticipated blockbuster titles. Among them are Destiny 2 coming to the PC for the first time, Star Wars Battlefront II, Shadow of War, and the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise, World War II. We are excited to be working within Nintendo on its acclaimed Switch gaming system. Great reviews and reports of the system selling out in many geographies are a strong part of this platform. Moving to professional visualization, Quadro revenue grew to $205 million, up 8% from a year ago, amid continued demand for high-end real-time rendering and more powerful mobile workstations. We are seeing significant increase in professional VR solutions, driven by Quadro P6000 GPUs. Lockheed Martin is deploying Quadro to create realistic VR walk-throughs of the U.S. Navy's most advanced ships. The Marines utilize VR to train air crew personnel. And IKEA is rolling out VR to many of its stores, helping consumers configure their kitchens from a huge array of options, which they can visualize in sharp detail. Next, data center, record revenue of $409 million was nearly triple that of a year ago. The 38% rise from Q4 marked its seventh consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Driving growth was demand from cloud service providers and enterprises building training clusters for web services, plus strong gains in high-performance computing, GRID graphics virtualization, and our DGX-1 AI super-computer. AI has quickly emerged as the single most powerful force in technology, and at the center of AI are NVIDIA GPUs. All of the world's major Internet and cloud service providers now use NVIDIA Tesla-based GPU accelerators, AWS, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft as well as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. We also announced that Microsoft is bringing NVIDIA Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs to its Azure cloud. Organizations are increasingly building out AI-enabled applications using training clusters, evident in part by growing demand for DGX-1. We are seeing a number of significant deals. Among them are Fujitsu's installment of 24 systems integrated into an AI supercomputer for RIKEN, Japan's largest research center, as well as new supercomputers at Oxford University, GE, and Audi. Working with Facebook, we announced the launch of the Caffe2 deep learning framework as well as Big Basin servers with Tesla P100 GPUs. To help meet huge demand for expertise in the field of AI, we announced earlier today plans to train 100 people this year through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, representing a 10x increase from last year. Through onsite training, public events, and online courses, DLI provides practical training on the tools of AI to developers, data scientists, and researchers. Our HPC business doubled year on year, driven by the adoption of Tesla GPUs into supercomputing centers worldwide. The use of AI and accelerated computing in HPC is driving additional demand in governance intelligence, higher education research, and finance. Our GRID graphics virtualization business more than tripled, driven by growth in business services, education, and automotive. Intuit's latest TurboTax release deploys GRID to connect tax filers seeking real-time advice with CPAs. And Honda is using GRID to bring together engineering and design teams based in different countries. Finally, automotive, revenue grew to a record $140 million, up 24% year over year and 9% sequentially, primarily from infotainment modules. We are continuing to expand our partnerships with companies using AI to address the complex problems of autonomous driving. Since our DRIVE PX 2 AI car platform began shipping just one year ago, more than 225 car and truck makers, suppliers, research organizations, and startups have begun developing with it. That number has grown by more than 50% in the past quarter alone, the result of the platform's enhanced processing power and the introduction of Tensor RT for its in-vehicle AI inferencing. This quarter, we announced two important partnerships. Bosch, the world's largest auto supplier, which does business all over the world's carmakers, is working to create a new AI self-driving car computer based on our Xavier platform. And PACCAR, one of the largest truck makers, is developing self-driving solutions for Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF. We continue to view AI as the only solution for autonomous driving. The nearly infinite range of road conditions, traffic patterns, and unexpected events are impossible to anticipate with hand-coded software or computer vision alone. We expect our DRIVE PX 2 AI platform to be capable of delivering Level 3 autonomy for cars, trucks, and shuttles by the end of the year, with Level 4 autonomy moving into production by the end of 2018. Now turning to the rest of the Q1 income statement, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the first quarter were 59.4% and 59.6% respectively, reflecting the decline in Intel licensing revenue. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $596 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $517 million, up 17% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiative. GAAP operating income was $554 million and non-GAAP operating income was $637 million, nearly doubling from a year ago. For the first quarter, GAAP net income was $507 million. Non-GAAP net income was $533 million, more than doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion. For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In Q1, we issued $82 million in quarterly cash dividends. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenue to be $1.95 billion plus or minus 2%. Excluding the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement, total revenue is expected to grow 3% sequentially. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.4%, 58.6% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. These reflect approximately a 100 basis points impact from the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $605 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $530 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $8 million, inclusive of additional charges from early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $3 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are both expected to be 17% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. Finally, this week we are sponsoring our annual GPU Technology Conference here in Silicon Valley. Reflecting the surging importance of accelerating computing, GTC has grown to more than 7,000 attendees from 60 countries, up from 1,000 when we started eight years ago. Among its highlights, Jen-Hsun will deliver a news-filled keynote tomorrow morning. We have 550-plus talks, more than half on AI. Developers will have access to 70 labs and workshops to learn about deep learning and GPU computing. And we will award a total of $1.5 million to the six most promising companies among the 1,300 in our Inception program for AI startups. We will be hosting our annual Investor Day tomorrow and hope to see many of you there. We will now open the call for questions. Please limit your questions to two. Operator, will you please poll for the questions?\nOperator: Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. On the HPC and data center business, clearly impressive growth, and I'm hoping that you can maybe drill down on the drivers here. I guess on the cloud side, we think of two different areas: GPU as a service versus the cloud companies' own AI effort. And I'm hoping you could help us understand to the extent where the demand is falling into either one of those buckets. And then on the enterprise side, I think there's a view out there that the enterprise is going to the cloud. So to hear you talk about training clusters for web services is very interesting, and I was hoping you could provide some more color on that demand driver.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. So our GPU computing business for data center is growing very fast, and it's growing on multiple dimensions. On the one hand, there's high-performance computing using traditional numerical methods. We call that HPC. That's growing. There's in enterprise the virtualization of graphics. There's a whole lot of desktop PCs running around. However, more and more people would like to have thinner laptops or they would like to have a different type of computer and still be able to run Windows. And they would like to virtualize basically their entire PC and put it in the data center. It's easier to manage. The total cost of ownership is lower. And mobile employees could enjoy their work wherever they happen to be. And so the second pillar of that is called GRID, and it's basically virtualizing the PC. And as you can tell, virtualization, mobility, better security, those are all driving forces there. And then there's the Internet companies. And the Internet companies, as you mentioned, really have two pillars. There's the Internet service provision part, where they're using deep learning for their own applications, whether it's photo tagging or product recommendation or recommending a restaurant or something you should buy or personalizing your webpage, helping you with search, provisioning up the right apps, the right advertisement, language translation, speech recognition, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of amazing applications that are made possible by deep learning. And so Internet service providers are using it for internal application development. And then lastly, what you mentioned is cloud service providers. And basically, because of the adoption of GPUs and because of the success of CUDA and so many applications are now able to be accelerated on GPUs, so that we can extend the capabilities of Moore's Law so that we can continue to have the benefits of computing acceleration, which in the cloud means reducing cost. That's on the cloud service provider side of the Internet companies. So that would be Amazon Web Services, it's the Google Compute cloud, Microsoft Azure, the IBM cloud, Alibaba's Aliyun (18:31 \u2013 19:03) by Microsoft Azure. We're starting to see almost every single cloud service around the world standardizing on VM video architecture, so we're seeing a lot of growth there as well. So I think the nut of it all is that we're seeing data center growth and GPU computing across the board.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: As a follow-up if I may, on the gaming side, what we have observed over time is that when you launch a new platform, it definitely creates demand, and you see 12 months of very good visibility into growth. And I was wondering if you see the data center numbers come in quarter after quarter here. To what extent do you think the data center demand that you're seeing is \u2013 I know probably you're only able to answer qualitatively. But to what extent do you think the data center is secular versus you have a new platform and there's just platform-driven demand?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: PC gaming is growing. There's no question about that. E-sports is growing the number of players in e-sports. The number of people who are enjoying e-sports is growing. MOBA [Multiplayer Online Battle Arena] is growing. I think it's amazing the growth of MOBA and the latest games. And of course, the first-party titles, the AAA titles are doing great. Battlefield is doing great, and I'm looking forward to the new Battlefield. I'm looking forward to the new Star Wars and I'm looking forward to the first time that Destiny is coming to the PC. As you know, it was a super hit on consoles, but the first-generation Destiny wasn't available on PC. Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, so I think the anticipation is pretty great. So I would say that PC gaming continues to grow, and it's hard to imagine people [audio gap] (21:03 \u2013 21:39) around in another amazing world. So I think people are going to be amazed at how long the alternate reality of the videogame market is going to continue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the solid results and execution. Jen-Hsun, for my first one, it's on the competitive landscape in your data center business. There has been more noise around FPGA or CPU or ASIC solutions also chasing the same market. What do you think is NVIDIA's sustainable competitive advantage? And what role is CUDA playing in helping you maintain this lead in this business?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Vivek, thanks for the question. First of all, it's really important to understand that the data centers, the cloud service providers, the Internet companies, they all get lumped together in one conversation. But obviously, the way they use computers are very different. There are three major pillars of computing up in the cloud or in large data centers, hyperscale. One pillar is just internal use of computing systems, for developing, for training, for advancing artificial intelligence. That's a high-performance computing problem. It's a very complicated software problem. The algorithms are changing all the time. They're incredibly complicated. The work that the AI researchers are doing are not trivial, and that's why they're in such great demand. And it's also the reason why computing resources have to be provisioned to them so that they can be productive. Having a scarce AI researcher waiting around for a computer to finish simulation or training is really quite unacceptable. And so that first pillar is the market that we \u2013 is a segment of the (23:46 \u2013 24:18) once the network is trained, it is put into production. Like for example, your Alexa speakers have a little tiny network inside. And so obviously, you can do inferencing on Alexa. It does voice recognition on a hot keyword. In the long term, your car will be able to do voice recognition and speech recognition. (24:42) Are we okay? Are we still on?\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. I think the...\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: No, Vivek, I was wondering whether the phone line was cut or not. So anyways, the second pillar is inferencing. And inferencing as it turns out is far, far less complicated than training. It's a trillion times less complicated, a billion times. It's a trillion times less complicated. And so once the network is trained, it can be deployed. And there are thousands of networks that are going to be running inside these hyperscale data centers, thousands of different networks, not one, thousands of different types. And they're detecting all kinds of different things. They're inferring all kinds of different things, classifying, predicting, all kinds of different things, whether it's photo or voice or videos or searches or whatnot. And in that particular case, our advantage \u2013 in that particular case, the current incumbent is CPUs. The CPU is really the only processor at the moment that has the ability to basically run every single network. And I think that's a real opportunity for us, and it's a growth opportunity for us. And one would suggest that FPGA is as well. One would suggest that ASICs like TPUs, TPUs and ASIC is as well. And I would urge you to come to the keynote tomorrow, and maybe I'll say a few words about that tomorrow as well. And then the last pillar is cloud service providers, and that's basically the outward public cloud provisioning a computing approach. It's not about provisioning inferencing. It's not about provisioning GPUs. It's really provisioning a computing platform. And that's one of the reasons why the NVIDIA CUDA platform and all of our software stack that we've created over time, whether it's for deep learning or molecular dynamics or all kinds of high-performance computing codes or linear algebra or computer graphics, all of our different software stacks make our cloud computing platform valuable, and that's why it's become the industry standard for GPU computing. And so those are three different pillars of hyperscalers, and it's just important to segment them so that we don't get confused.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's very helpful. And as my quick follow-up, Jen-Hsun, there is a perception that your gaming business has been driven a lot more by pricing and adoption of more premium product, and hence there could be some kind of feeling to how much gamers are willing to pay for these products. Could you address that? Are you seeing the number of gamers and the number of cards grow, and how long can they continue to reach for more premium products? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: The average selling price of the NVIDIA GeForce is about a third of a game console. That's the way to think about it. That's the simple math. People are willing to spend $200, $300, $400, $500 for a new game console, and the NVIDIA GeForce GPU PC gaming card is on average far less. There are people who just absolutely demand the best. And the reason for that is because they're driving a monitor or they're driving multiple monitors at a refresh rate well beyond a TV. So if you have a 4K or you want 120 hertz or some people are even driving it to 200 hertz, those kind of displays demand a lot more horsepower to drive than an average television, whether it's 1080p or 4K at 60 frames a second or 30 frames a second. And so the amount of horsepower they need is great. But that's just because they just really love their rig, and they're surrounded in it, and they just want the best. But the way to think about that is ultimately that's the opportunity for us. I think GeForce is a game console. And the right way to think about that is at an equivalent ASP of some $200 \u2013 $300, that's probably potentially an opportunity ahead for GeForce.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. I guess first question is around gaming. I was hoping you could walk through how you're thinking about seasonality here in calendar 2017, particularly as Pascal launch calendarizes and you get both to launch coming I presume early 2018. I would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory of that business.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: First of all, GeForce is sold a unit at a time and it's sold all over the world and it's a consumer product. It's a product that is sold both into our installed base as well as growing our installed base. When we think about GeForce, these are the parameters involved. How much of our installed base has upgraded to Pascal? How much of our installed base is growing? How is gaming growing overall? What are the driving dynamics of gaming, whether it's team sports or MOBA or using games for artistic expression? It's related to the AAA titles that are coming out. Some years the games are just incredible. Some years the games are less incredible. These days the production quality of the games have just become systematically so good that we've had years now of blockbuster hits. So these are really the dimensions of it. And then it's overlaid on top of it with some seasonality because people do buy graphics cards and game consoles for Christmas and the holidays, and there are international holidays where people are given money as gifts and they save up the money for a new game console or a new game platform. And so in a lot of ways our business is driven by games, so it's not unlike the characteristics of the rest of the gaming industry.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, on the inventory side, that grew I think 3% sequentially. Can you walk through the moving parts there? What's driving that, and is foundry diversification part of that? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: The driving reasons for inventory growth is new products, and that's probably all I ought to say for now. I would come to GTC. Come to the keynote tomorrow. I think it will be fun.\nC.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Great, thanks a lot.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, thanks, C.J.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, congrats on the strong quarter. Jen-Hsun, can you maybe talk a little bit about the breadth of your customer base in data center relative to maybe 12 months ago? Are you seeing the same customer group buy more GPUs, or is the growth in your business more a function of the broadening of your customer base?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Toshiya. Let me think here. I think one year ago \u2013 one year ago was \u2013 maybe it was two years ago. Maybe it was somewhere between 18 months ago or so when I think Jeff Dean gave a talk where he said that Google was using a lot of GPUs for deep learning. I think it wasn't much longer ago than that, and really that was the only public customer that we had in the hyperscale data center. Fast-forward a couple years, we now have basically everybody. Every hyperscaler in the world is using NVIDIA for either deep learning, for some announcements that you'll read about in data center deployment, tomorrow hopefully. And then a lot of them have now standardized on provisioning the NVIDIA architecture in the cloud. And so I guess in the course of one or two years, we went from basically hyperscale being an insignificant part of our overall business to quite a large part of our business, and as you can see, also the fastest-growing part of the business.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then as my follow-up, I had a question for Colette. Three months ago, I think you went out of your way to guide data center up sequentially. And for the July quarter, ex the Intel business going away, you're guiding revenue up 3% sequentially. Can you maybe provide some additional color for the individual segment? Thank you.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks for the question. We feel good about the guidance that we're providing for Q2. We wanted to make sure that it was understood the impact of Intel that's incorporated in there. It's still too early, given that it's \u2013 to say about the same size of what we just finished in Q1 to make comments specifically exactly where we think each one of those businesses will end up. But again, we do believe data center is a super-great opportunity for us. I think you'll hear more about that tomorrow. But we don't have any more additional details on our guidance, but we feel good about the guidance that we gave.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Jen-Hsun, can you talk about the adoption of GPU in the cloud? At the CES earlier this year, you guys announced GeForce NOW. Curious how the adoption of GeForce is going.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes, Atif, thanks for the question. GeForce NOW is really an exciting platform. It virtualizes GeForce. It puts it in the cloud, turns it into a gaming PC that's a service, that can be streamed as a service. And I said at GTC that around this time that we'll likely open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta for some time, and we'll shortly go to external beta. And the last time I checked, there's many, many tens of thousands of people who are signed up for external beta trials. And so I'm looking forward to letting people try it. But the important thing to realize about that is that's still years away from really becoming a major gaming service. And it's still years away from being able to find the right balance between cost and quality of service and the pervasiveness of virtualizing a gaming PC. So we've been working on it for several years, and these things take a while. My personal experience is almost every great thing takes about a decade. And if that's so, then we've got a few more years to go.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. As a follow-up, with your win and success in Nintendo Switch, does that open up the console market with other console makers? Is that a business that is of interest to you?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Consoles is not really a business to us. It's a business to them. And we're selected to work on these consoles. And if it makes sense and the strategic alignment is great and we're in a position to be able to do it, because the opportunity cost of building a game console is quite high. The number of engineers who know how to build computing platforms like this \u2013 and in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just an incredible console that fits in such a small form factor. And it could both be a mobile gaming device as well as a console gaming device. It's just really quite amazing, and they just did an amazing job. Somebody asked me a few months ago before it was launched how I thought it was going to do. And of course without saying anything about it, I said that it delighted me in a way that no game console has done in the last 10 \u2013 15 years. And it's true, this is a really, really innovative product and really quite ingenious. And if you ever have a chance to get it in your hands, it's just really delightful. And so in that case, the opportunity to work on it was just really, really too enticing. We really wanted to do it, but it always requires deep strategic thought because it took several hundred engineers to work on, and they could be working on something else like all of the major initiatives we have. And so we have to be mindful about the strategic opportunity cost that goes along with these. But in the case of the Nintendo Switch, it's just a home run. I'm so glad I did it, and it was the perfect collaboration for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the real strong execution. I wanted to follow up on some of the prepared comments on automotive with my first question, and it's this. I think Colette mentioned that there were 225 car and truck development engagements that were underway, up 50% in the last quarter. The question is, as you engage with those partners, what's NVIDIA finding in terms of the time from engagement to revenue generation? And what are you finding with your hit rate in terms of converting those individual engagements into revenues?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I know the second one easier. The second one is the revenue contribution is not significant at the time \u2013 at this moment. But I expect it to be high, and that's why we're working on it. The 200 developers who are working on the DRIVE PX platform are doing it in a lot of different ways. And at the core, it's because in the future, every aspect of transportation will be autonomous. And if you think through what's going on in the world, one of the most important and powerful effects that's happening right now is the Amazon effect. We're grabbing our phone, we're buying something, and we expect it to be delivered to us tomorrow. When you sent up those set of electronic instruction, the next thing that had to happen is a whole bunch of trucks have to move around, and they have to go from trucks to maybe smaller trucks and from smaller trucks to maybe a small van that ultimately delivers it to your house. And so if you will, transportation is the physical Internet. It's the atomic Internet. It's the molecular Internet of society. And without it, everything that we're experiencing today wouldn't be able to continue to scale. And so you could imagine everything from autonomous trucks to autonomous cars surely and autonomous shuttles and vans and motorcycles and small pizza delivery robots and drones and things like that. And for a long time, it's going to augment truck drivers and delivery professionals, who quite frankly we just don't have enough of. The world is just growing too fast in an instant delivery delivered to your home, delivered to you right now phenomenon, and we just don't have enough delivery professionals. And so I think autonomous capability is going to make it possible for us to take pressure off that system and reduce the amount of accidents and make it possible for that entire infrastructure to be a lot more productive. And so that's one of the reasons why you're seeing so much enthusiasm. It's not just the branded cars. I think the branded cars get a lot of attention and we're excited about our partnerships there. And gosh, I love driving autonomous cars. But in the final analysis, I think the way to think about the autonomous future is every aspect of mobility and transportation and delivery will have autonomous \u2013 will be augmented by AI.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful color, Jen-Hsun. The follow-up is related to the data center business, and you provided a lot a very useful customer and other information. My question is higher level. Given your very unique position in helping to nurture AI for the last many years and your deep insights into the way that customers are adopting this, as investors try and understand the sustainability of recent growth, can you help us understand where you believe AI adoption is overall? And since Colette threw out a baseball comment earlier, if we thought about AI adoption in reference to a nine-inning game, where are we in that nine-inning game?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Let's see here. It's a great question, and there are a couple ways to come at it. First of all, AI is going to infuse all of software. AI is going to eat software. Whereas Marc [Andreessen] said that software is going to eat the world, AI is going to eat software, and it's going to be in every aspect of software. Every single software developer has to learn deep learning. Every single software developer has to apply machine learning. Every software developer will have to learn AI. Every single company will use AI. AI is the automation of automation, and it will likely be the transmission. We're going to for the first time see the transmission of automation the way we're seeing the transmission and wireless broadcast of information for the very first time. I'm going to be able to send you automation, send you a little automation by email. And so the ability for AI to transform industry is well understood now. It's really about automation of everything, and the implication of it is quite large. We've been using now deep learning \u2013 we've been in the area of deep learning for about six years. And the rest of the world has been focused on deep learning for about somewhere between one to two, and some of them are just learning about it. And almost no companies today use AI in a large way. So on the one hand, we know now that the technology is of extreme value, and we're getting a better understanding of how to apply it. On the other hand, no industry uses it at the moment. The automotive industry is in the process of being revolutionized because of it. The manufacturing industry will be. Everything in transport will be. Retail, e-tail, everything will be. And so I think the impact is going to be large, and we're just getting started. We're just getting started. Now that's kind of a first inning thing. The only trouble with a baseball analogy is that in the world of tech, things don't \u2013 every inning is not the same. In the beginning the first inning feels like \u2013 it feels pretty casual and people are enjoying peanuts. The second inning for some reason is shorter and the third inning is shorter than that and the fourth inning is shorter than that. And the reason for that is because of exponential growth. Speed is accelerating. And so from the bystanders who are on the outside looking in, by the time the third inning comes along, it's going to feel like people are traveling at the speed of light next to you. If you happen to be on one of the photons, you're going to be okay. But if you're not on the deep learning train in a couple of two, three innings, it's gone. And so that's the challenge of that analogy because things aren't moving in linear time. Things are moving exponentially.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Rosenblatt Securities.\nHans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Hey, Jen-Hsun, can you give us like a state of the union on process node and technology roadmaps that you guys see? Intel made a pretty nice exposition of where they are in terms of their transistors and so on. So what's your comfort level as you see process technology and your roadmaps for new GPUs? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes. Hi, Hans. I think there are a couple of ways to think about it. First of all, we know that this is the \u2013 we know that some \u2013 the world calls it the end of Moore's Law, but it's really the end of two dynamics that has happened. And one dynamic of course is the end of processor architecture productive innovation, end of instruction-level parallelism advances. The second is the end of Dennard scaling. And the combination of those two things makes it look like it's the end of Moore's Law. The easy way to think about that is that we can no longer rely \u2013 if we want to advance computing performance, we can no longer rely on transistor advances alone. That's one of the reasons why NVIDIA has never been obsessed about having the latest transistors. We want the best transistors. There's no question about it, but we don't need it to advance. And the reason for that is because we advance computing on such a multitude of levels, all the way from architecture, this architecture we call GPU accelerated computing, to the software stacks on top, to the algorithms on top, to the applications that we work with. We tune it across the top, from top to bottom all the way from bottom to top. And so as a result, transistors is just one of the 10 things that we use. And like I said, it's really, really important to us. And I want the best, and TSMC provides us the absolute best that we can get, and we push along with them as hard as we can. But in the final analysis, it's one of the tools in the box.\nHans Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I've attended GTC the last couple days. I'm really quite impressed by the breadth of presentations and the number of industries you guys are affecting. And I guess, just on that note, how do you think about segmenting the sales effort? Do you have a healthcare vertical, an avionics vertical, a financial vertical, or is it having the best building blocks and you're letting your customers discover stuff?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks a lot, Joe. You answered it right there. It's both of those. The first thing is that we have developed platforms that are useful per industry. And so we have a team working with the healthcare industry. We have a team that's working with the Internet service providers. We have a team that's working with the manufacturing industry. We have a team that's working with the financial services industry. We have a team that's working with media and entertainment and with enterprise, with the automotive industry. And so we have different verticals. We call them verticals, and we have teams of business development people, developer relations, a computational mathematician that works with each one of the industries to optimize their software for our GPU computing platform. And so it starts with developing a platform stack. Of course, one of our most famous examples of that is our gaming business. It's just another vertical for us, and it starts with GameWorks that runs on top of GeForce, and it has its own ecosystem of partners. And so that's for each one of the verticals and each one of the ecosystems. And then the second thing that we do is we have horizontally partner management teams that work with our partners, the OEM partners and the go-to-market partners, so that we could help them succeed. And then of course, we rely a great deal on the extended salesforce of our partners so they can help to evangelize our computing platform all over the world. And so it's this mixed approach between dedicated vertical market business development teams as well as a partnership approach to partner with our OEM partners that has really made our business scale so fast.\nJoseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, that's helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had was regarding Colette's comment that HPC had doubled year on year. Just wondering if you had any comments on what drove that. And is that an indication of the supercomputer types of businesses, or are there other dynamics in terms of addressing new workloads with HPC products?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: HPC is different than supercomputing. Supercomputing to us is a collection of \u2013 not a collection, but is 20 different supercomputing sites around the world. And some of the famous ones, whether it's Oak Ridge or Blue Water at UCSC, you've got TITech in Japan. There are supercomputing centers that are either national supercomputing centers or they could be public and open supercomputing centers for open science. And so we consider those supercomputing centers. High-performance computing is used by companies who are using simulation approaches to develop products or to simulate something. It could be scenarios for predicting equity, or for example, as you guys know, Wall Street is the home of some of the largest supercomputing or high-performance computing centers. The energy industry, Schlumberger, for example, is a great partner of ours, and they have a massive, massive high-performance computing infrastructure. And Procter & Gamble uses high-performance computers to simulate their products. I think last year McDonald's was at GTC, and I hope they come this year as well. And so I think high-performance computing, another way of thinking about it is that more and more people really have to use simulation approaches for product discovery and product design and product simulation and to stress the products beyond what is possible in a physical way so that they understand the tolerance of the products and make sure they're as reliable as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, thanks for taking my questions and nice results. Just curious, Jen-Hsun, you've seen a half dozen, dozen private companies going after the desiccant (54:35) silicon Google TPU. I know you felt the comparison to a CPU maybe wasn't fair, but I was just curious your response to these claims of 10x, 100x, 500x performance better than a GPU.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: It's not that it's not fair. It's just not right; it's not correct. And so in business, who cares about being fair? And so I wasn't looking for fair; I was just looking for right. And so the data has to be correct. It turns out, and I said earlier that our hyperscale businesses have three different pillars. There's training, which our GPUs are quite good at. There's cloud service provision, which is a GPU computing architecture opportunity where CUDA is really the reason why people are adopting it and all the applications that have adopted CUDA over the years. And then there's inferencing, and inferencing is a zero opportunity for us, a zero business for us at the moment. We do 0% of our business in inferencing, and it's 100% on CPUs. And in the case of Google, they did a great thing and built a TPU as an ASIC. And they compared the TPU against one of our older GPUs. And so I published a blog. I wrote a blog to clarify some of the comparisons, and you can look that up. But the way to think about that is our Pascal was probably approximately twice the performance of the TPU, the first-generation TPU. And it's incumbent upon us to continue to drive the performance of inferencing. This is something that's still kind of new for us. And tomorrow I'm probably going to say a few words about inferencing and maybe introduce a few ideas, but inferencing is new to us. There are 10 million CPUs in the world in the cloud, and today many of them are running Hadoop and doing queries and looking up files and things like that. But in the future, the belief is that the vast majority of the world's cloud queries will be inference queries, will be AI queries. Every single query that goes into the cloud will likely have some artificial intelligence network that it processes, and I think that's our opportunity. We have an opportunity to do inferencing better than anybody in the world, and it's up to us to prove it. At the moment, I think it's safe to say that the P40, the Tesla P40 is the fastest on the planet, period. And then from here on forward, it's incumbent upon us to continue to lean into that and do a better job.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then just moving to the gaming GPU side, I was just wondering if you can just talk about the competitive landscape looking back at the last refresh. And then looking forward into the back half of this year, I think your competitors have a new platform. I'm just curious as to your thoughts as to how the share worked out on the previous refresh and then the competitiveness into the second half of this year.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: My assessment is that the competitive position is not going to change.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's a short answer, thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one actually on the gaming side. I remember at CES you had mentioned a leasing model that almost effectively target the low-end consumer of gaming products. So I'm just wondering if that will be some catalyst in the back half. Or how do we think about gaming working out in terms of both the leasing model and the year-over-year comparison getting a bit difficult?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Hi, Mitch. I was just talking about that earlier in one of the questions called GeForce NOW. And I announced at CES and I said that right around this time of year we're going to open it up for external beta. We've been running internal beta and closed beta for some time. And so we're looking forward to opening up the external beta. My expectation is that it's going to be some time as we scale that out. It's going to take several years. I don't think it's something that's going to be an overnight success. And as you know, overnight successes don't happen overnight. However, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to extend the GeForce platform beyond the gamers that we currently have in our installed base. There are several billion gamers on the planet. And I believe that every human will be a gamer someday, and every human will have some way to enjoy an alternative universe some way someday. And we would love to be the company that brings it to everybody. And the only way to really do that on a very, very large scale basis and reach all those people is over the cloud. And so I think our PC gaming business is going to continue to be quite vibrant. It's going to continue to advance, and then hopefully we can overlay our cloud reach on top of that over time.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it, thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks a lot, thanks for all the questions today. I really appreciate it. We had another record quarter. We saw growth across our four market platforms. AI is expanding. Data center nearly tripled, large ISP/CSP deployments everywhere. PC gaming is still growing, e-sports, AAA gaming titles fueling our growth there. And we have great games on the horizon. Autonomous vehicles becoming imperative on all sectors of transportations, as we talked about earlier. We have a great position with our DRIVE AI computing platform. And as Moore's Law continues to slow, GPU accelerated computing is becoming more important than ever, and NVIDIA is at the center of that. Don't miss tomorrow's GTC keynote. We'll have exciting news to share, next-generation AI, self-driving cars, exciting partnerships, and more. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. As you know we lowered fourth quarter guidance for January 28th and the results are in line with our pre-announcement. Q4 revenue was $2.21 billion, down 24% from a year earlier, driven primarily by 45% year-on-year decline in gaming. Full year revenue was $11.72 billion, up 21% from the previous year. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $954 million was down 45% year-on-year and down 46% sequentially, weaker than our expectations heading into the quarter. Full year revenue was up 13% to $6.25 billion. Three factors contributed to the Q4 gaming revenue decline. First, post crypto inventory of GPUs in the channel caused us to reduce shipments in order to allow excess channel inventory to sell through. We expect channel inventory to normalize in Q1 in line with one to two quarter timeline we had outlined on our previous earnings call. Second, deteriorating macro economic conditions, particularly in China, impacted consumer demand for our GPUs; and third, sales of certain high end GPUs using our new Turing architecture, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and 2070 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture. These products deliver a revolutionary leap in performance and innovation with real time ray-tracing and AI, but some customers may have delayed their purchase while waiting for lower price points or further demonstrations of the RTX technology and actual gains. The significant volatility in our gaming business over the last few quarters has been challenging to model. Crypto mining demand and its after effects have distorted the quarter-to-quarter trends in the gaming business and obscured its underlying trend line. Let me try to give you some visibility into what we believe the long live business looks like. As you know, our gaming business consists of desktop gaming, notebook gaming and gaming console products. To get a sense of the underlying run rate in our gaming business last year, it is helpful to look at desktop gaming revenue across the period that doesn't include crypto demand. Let's look at the four quarters starting from Q2 of last year to the current quarter or Q1 of this year. In Q2 and Q3 of last year with the benefit of hindsight, we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming products relative to where end demand turned out to be. To allow the channel to work down that excess channel inventory, we shipped a lower amount relative to end demand in Q4 and will do so again in Q1. Therefore, exiting Q1, we expect channel inventories to be at normal levels. On average, our desktop gaming revenue across these four quarters is about $900 million. We believe this represents the normalized level of desktop gaming for this period. Notebook gaming and gaming consoles have averaged close to $500 million per quarter over these same four quarters, such in total we believe are normalized [indiscernible] gaming business revenue run rate is approximately $1.4 billion. As we look past Q1, we expect the channel inventory correction to be behind us and our business to have bottomed. On a full year basis, we expect our gaming business to be down slightly given the tough first half compares with growth in Turing and notebook gaming. At CES last month, we launched into the recovery of our gaming business. We announced the GeForce RTX 2060 at the mid range price point of [$349] [ph]. The 2060 delivers a 60% performance improvement over the GTX 1060 while also bringing Turing's real time ray tracing and AI features to the mass market for the first time. The 2060 has received rave reviews and is off to a great start. In addition, we announced a record of 40 plus new Turing based gaming laptops, which became available on January 29th.This is more than double the number of GeForce powered notebooks in the market last year. Featuring the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture [indiscernible] the laptops are able to deliver the performance of desktop gaming PCs. We expect GeForce laptops to continue to be the fastest growing segment of gaming. We're also pleased to see growing momentum in the RTX ecosystem. As more game developers are creating content to take advantage of the Turing architectures' amazing capabilities. Just this week, DLSS technology is becoming available in two blockbuster games, Battlefield 5 and Metro Exodus, and Anthem coming soon. In addition at CES, Justice and Atomic Heart showed demos featuring ray tracing and DLSS, and the large pipelines of games plan to integrate RTX technology. Pairing DLSS with ray tracing can provide comparable frame rates to traditional restorization but also much more beautiful cinematic visual, the best of both worlds. This is the next generation of gaming. While this was a challenging quarter in our gaming business we look forward to putting the channel inventory correction behind us and building on the solid foundation of our Turing architecture. Moving to data center. Revenue was $679 million, up 12% year-on-year and down 14% sequentially. Full year data center revenue was $2.93 billion, up a strong 52%. The Q4 sales decline was broad based across verticals and markets and geographies. As the quarter progressed, customers around the world became increasingly cautious due to rising economic uncertainty and the number of deals did not close in January. In addition, hyperscale and cloud purchases declined both sequentially and year-on-year as several customers paused at the end of the year. We believe the pause is temporary. The strength of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform remains intact. We continue to lead the industry in performance for scientific computing and deep learning. And with CUDA's programability, we can continue to expand the value of our platform. For example, we recently announced RAPIDS, our CUDA acceleration stack for data analytics and machine learning. In December, the first objective third-party AI benchmark called MLPerf became available. And NVIDIA captured the top spots in the six test categories for training deep learning models that we competed in. And in January, Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs are now available in beta in its data centers in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, India, Singapore and Tokyo. The T4 is a universal cloud GPU that accelerates a variety of workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, broader machine learning, data analytics and graphics. Our visibility remains low in the current cautious spending environment, and we don't forecast a meaningful recovery in the data center segment until later in the year. However, we are working closely with hyperscales around the world to integrate NVIDIA TensorRT software and Tensor Core GPUs into their inference production flow. Inference currently drives less than 10% of our data center business, while represents a significant expansion of our addressable market opportunity going forward. We have also strengthened our product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities to address vertical industries that have an enormous data and analytics requirement, such as automotive, financial services, retail, healthcare and consumer Internet services. With our RAPIDS software stack, NVIDIA can accelerate data analytics and machine learning and as we have done in deep learning. And we made it easier for customers to adopt our technology by partnering with Cisco, IBM, NetApp and Pure Storage to create pre-integrated systems that can be sold through their global IT channels. Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $293 million, up 15% from the prior year and down 4% sequentially. Full year revenue was $1.13 billion, up 21% year-on-year. New applications like data science, AI and VR, as well as the need for thin and light mobile workstations remain key growth drivers for the business. We had key wins in the quarter, including Boeing, Google, LinkedIn and Toyota for applications including AI and robotics. This past week with our partners HP, Dell, Lenovo, we announced the availability of Quadro RTX workstation. Quadro RTX is the most significant workstation GPU upgrade in 10 years. It will enable millions of designers and creative artists for the first time to work interactively with super high resolution media and photorealistic 3D rendering, enabling them to be creative with dramatically improved productivity. Finally, turning to automotive. Q4 revenue was $163 million, up 23% from a year ago and down 5% sequentially. Full year revenue reached $641 million, up 15%. The sequential decline was largely seasonal. The year-on-year growth was driven by the increasingly adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals, partially offset by declines in legacy infotainment. Last month at CES, we announced DRIVE AutoPilot, the world's first commercially available level two plus self driving car computer. This system offers sophisticated automated driving features that far surpassed today's ADAS offerings, increasing the vehicles' performance, functionality and road safety, while the driver remains in control. To deliver these capabilities, DRIVE AutoPilot uses multiple deep neural networks surround camera perception both in and outside of the car and significant AI processing capability. Systems from our Tier 1 partners, including Bosch, Continental, Veoneer, and ZF were all on-display at our booths. Although, as announced back in October, it was our first level two plus design win with cars slated for production in the early 2020s. Mercedes-Benz has also chosen NVIDIA for its next generation autonomous vehicle and cockpit computer. This centralized AI computing system replaces dozens of smaller processors inside current cars. DRIVE AutoPilot is a major milestone for NVIDIA, and takes our high functioning self-driving capabilities into the mass market. This will be an important year for robo-taxi pilots and initial level two design wins. Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 54.7% and non-GAAP was 56%, down sequentially and year-on-year, primarily due to $128 million charge for DRAM [port] and other components associated with our lower than expected Q4 revenue and current market conditions. GAAP operating expenses were $913 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $755 million, up 25% and 24% year-on-year respectively. The GAAP EPS was $0.92, down 48% from a year earlier. Full year GAAP EPS was $6.63, up 38% from the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 53% from a year ago. Full year non-GAAP EPS was $6.64, up 35% from the prior year. We returned $1.95 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year through a combination of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. As we announced last quarter, we plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and buybacks. We repurchased $700 million during the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2020; we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion plus or minus 2%; GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.8% and 59% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points; GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $930 million and $755 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an income of $20 million; GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items; capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. For fiscal 2020, we expect Q1 to mark the bottom as we passed the inventory correction in gaming. We expect total revenue for the year to be flat to down slightly with growth in our four end markets, compensating for the absence of crypto revenue and the excess selling for most year. We plan to grow OpEx in the high single digits this year, and we continue to invest in our focus growth areas of graphics, AI and self-driving cars. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary, and other information is available on our IR Web site. In closing, I'd like to highlight upcoming events for the financial community; we will be presenting at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom conference on February 26; and our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the quarter of fiscal 2020 take place on May 15th. We will now open the call for customers. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had two questions. First, Colette, you talked about the weakness you saw in the 2070 and the 2080 in the quarter. I guess this question is more for Jen-Hsun. Are you concerned at all about your ability to convince and incentivize gamer [indiscernible] as Colette pointed out, it's more of a timing thing. And the second question is inventory was up on the balance sheet. Colette, if you can just provide some color there and expectations going forward. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: When we launched the 2070 and 2080, it was the first time we've ever launched a new generation where the only available SKUs were very high end. And in addition to that, the early boards that came out into the marketplace were the special edition and the over clocked versions. And the MSRP versions didn't show up for some short time after, couple of months after. And so the conditions weren't ideal, if you will. We weren't able to launch into the mainstream segment with 2060 for all the reasons that I think everybody understands now. And so I think that the situ wasn't ideal. When you take a look at our situation now, every single graphics card had the best performance at its price point and it remains so today. And I think that right out of the box, it delivered excellent performance. It is true that everybody was hoping to see more games with RTX on day one. But it's such a new technology with ray-tracing and AI for image processing that it's only really possible to make available with new games, which is tied to the schedules of new games. And now they're starting to come out. Battlefield 5, Metro Exodus, I think that the reviews from this week are just spectacular, people are finally realizing what it is that we were talking about and that it's possible with RTX technology, the combination of applying ray-tracing and AI for us to deliver much more beautiful images without sacrificing performance and so I think people are starting to understand now the benefits of the RTX technology and we just needed some time to demonstrate it and I think the takeaway is simply this RTX is the best graphics card at every single price point without using ray tracing technology and for new games that are coming out each one of the new games that come out in the future will apply ray tracing work with developers to apply ray tracing technology; I think everybody agrees that it is the surely the next generation. And then probably one of the biggest stories that came out just last week is a Unreal Engine and Unity both of the game engines are going to incorporate RTX and ray-tracing technology in the engine itself. And so all future games in the future will be able to take advantage of that, so that's a really big news and I'm excited about that.\nColette Kress: So Toshiya to answer your second question regarding our inventory balance. Our inventory dollars at the end of Q4 rose just due to the weaker than expected finish to Q4. Inventory right now is primarily related to Turing, Volta and DGX. And we don't expect any further write-downs as we have incorporated approximately 128 million of write-downs within the current Q4.\nOperator: Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: I guess on the commentary regarding a pause in spending in data center and a handful of deals that got delayed. Can you give a little bit more color in terms of I guess what you're seeing across enterprise cloud, high performance compute, and I guess within that, how you're seeing the ramp of T4? And I guess if you can then speak to I'm sure embedded in the fiscal '20 guidance is a pretty nice ramp into the second half. What are the key drivers, key milestones that you're looking for to see that business reaccelerate higher as we go through the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: The slowdown is broad based. We saw it across every vertical, every geography. There was just a level of cautiousness across all of the enterprise customers and the cloud service providers that we've not experienced in a while. And I think that it has to be temporary. The computing needs of Earth is, it's not certainly been satisfied with what was shipped last quarter. And so I think that the demand will return and customers will return. Our situation in data centers is dramatically better year-over-year. And if you take a look at where we are, our deep learning solution is unquestionably the best in the world. We introduced T4 with inference capability, it's the world's first universal cloud GPU and it does everything that NVIDIA does, all in one GPU and 75 watts. And so it fits into every hyperscale data center. We're engaged with Internet Service Providers all around the world, optimizing and porting their high production models networks so that we could deploy it into production. So we now have four different new growth drivers for our data center in addition to deep learning and scientific computing; we have inference that we're actively working on; we have data analytics that\u2019s called rapids, some people call it Big Data, but data analytics and machine learning; the third is rendering. And because of the partnerships that we've developed and the excitement that people see around enterprises around the world, we've developed partnerships with large IT companies to pre-configure systems that make it easier for enterprises to be able to adopt our technology. So we have four new ways for us to grow our enterprise business. And so we're looking forward to when the pause releases and we'll get back to growing.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya: I just had a clarification and a question. On the clarification, gross margins. Colette, what is the normalized run rate for gross margins? As you get to your sales back to normalized levels, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins? And will there be any impact from the balance sheet inventory? And then on the question Jen-Hsun, can you give us more reassurance that gaming is still a growth business? I understand that over the last year, there's been a lot of confusion, there's been macro issues. But if you look at the number of gamers and the mix of product that they are buying so essentially to sell through to gamers, has that been on an upward trajectory? And as part of that, when do you think we could see Turing exceed the demand you saw for Pascal? Thank you.\nColette Kress: On gross margin, our gross margin, the largest contributor to our absolute gross margin is really just the mix of our product. The mix of our products based on our market platforms, but also the mix of our products within data center, as well as within gaming. We provided guidance for Q1, which has a good level of confidence from us and we'll see how it goes from there.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The fundamentals of gaming has not changed, there more gamers than ever. Games are better than ever. There's been a recent shift in the popularity of multiplayer competitive e-sports like games, that's good for hardware. It lowers the barrier to entry, because it's free to play with the exception of downloadable content. And so the barriers to entry is lower but you could see that the excitement around Fortnight and recently with Apex Legend, PUBG is still popular, League of Legends is still popular. And so this genre of games is both competitive, requires great hardware, it attracts a lot more players, because it's social and you want to play with your friends and it's much stickier, because it happens to be social, it happens to be a game where you have to play with a whole bunch of other people. And so I think that gaming is vibrant as ever before. If you take the methodology that Colette described earlier and you averaged out our underlying gaming business and you compare that to a year before, surely it grew. If you compare that -- if you compare also the rate at which our gaming notebook is growing, I think that's pretty exciting. I think last year and we had mentioned it before that our gaming notebook business grew 50% year-over-year. And just at CES the number of new notebook designs that came out with Turing, because of an invention that we created called Max-Q and because of the energy efficiency of the Turing architecture, you can now make notebooks that are really wonderful and also high performing at the same time. And so I think the dynamics are the same and gaming is going to continue to be a growth business.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line and John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Colette, I appreciate all the data you gave us on trying to size normalized demand for gaming. What I have to ask though is if you\u2019re going through channel inventory worked out in fiscal first quarter, it seems like to hit your full year guide the expectation is for gaming revenue to accelerate well above that normalized level you talked about. What am I doing the math right? And if I am, what gives you confidence throughout the year that you can see that gaming growth off of these numbers?\nColette Kress: I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Jen-Hsun finish that question. So along the lines of Jen-Hsun's response in terms of what we do believe are the key drivers of gaming. And everything's still intact in terms of gaming, both with our Turing architecture, the growth expected with our Turing architecture, as well as the green from the notebook, we do believe will be great drivers as we head into the rest of the year. We'll have to wait and see in terms of how that plays out but that is really the underlying reason why the growth will continue.\nJen-Hsun Huang: I think your math isn't wrong. The part that you probably didn't consider is notebook. Our GeForce notebook business is quite large.\nJohn Pitzer: And then maybe as a follow-up just on the data center side. Clearly, you\u2019ve talked about new applications that should help grow your TAM inside of data center. I\u2019m just curious the calendar fourth quarter of last year, I think marked the first time that a competitor had some meaningful volumes in GPU in the data center. There's always talk about the [ITCM] guys wanting to do their own ASICs. What anecdotal evidence can you give us to help us get more comfortable that what\u2019s going on here is more macro and not share loss either to competition and/or architectural differences between GPUs and ASICs?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don't see them in high performance computing. And so I haven't found where -- we haven't met them in high performance computing and deep learning, and in the areas that we serve. And so competitively, really we don't see it. But the bigger picture I think is this that the market segments that we serve, whether it's in deep learning, machine learning, data analytics, those segments are really quite large. And I think that it is unquestionably the future of high performance computing is going to be highly data driven, both computational methods, algorithmic methods, as well as data driven methods. And so I think the fundamental trend has not changed. We have four new growth drivers, four new ways to grow in the data center. The first one of course is inference. We're making a lot of progress there, T4 is doing great. I think we're going to be quite successful with T4s. You just got to keep saying that has second generation Tensor Core, 75 watts and you can use it for training, you can use it for inference, you could use it for remote graphics, you could use it for high performance computing. And it fits literally into any hyperscale data center. The second way is data analytics. This is a brand new thing for us. You must know that Big Data and using data to predict dynamics in the marketplaces is really important in retail and e-tail, and healthcare, and financial services. And there's never been accelerated approach to solve this problem for people. And because of the flexibility of CUDA and because the performance of architecture, over the course of last year, we reengineered the entire data analytics stack. So that we can accelerate, it's called RAPIDS. That work is really, really important and I hope to give you guys updates on that on a regular basis. Rendering is a brand new market for us, because of Turing, finally we can we can render photo realistic images in accelerated way. There are millions of servers in the world that are driving render farms and they're getting upgraded on a regular basis. And then lastly, we've been successful with CSPs, because they're easy for us to reach. But the world's enterprises are far and many and they're giant industries. And our company's sales coverage doesn't allow us to reach every single healthcare company and every single insurance company and retail company. And that's where our network of partners really come in. We have great partnerships with HP. We have great partnerships with Dell and Cisco and IBM. And now we've developed relationships with the storage vendors. And the reason for that is because most of these big data problems require great deal of storage. And they all see -- they see the opportunities that we created. And we came together to create pre-configured systems that are optimized attuned. And these high performance systems that you can just bring into the company prop up and install, and we're seeing a lot of great success with that. And so we have four different ways to grow our data center business and we're enthusiastic about it. I'm optimistic about it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTim Arcuri: First, I had a clarification. Colette, I just wanted to clarify what the mix is assumed for the fiscal Q1 guidance. So you assuming that data center and gaming are both flat sequentially. And then I guess my question was. Can you help us shape the revenue through the year? To get to your full year guidance, you have to add roughly, maybe $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion from where you are in fiscal Q1. How does that shape through the year? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Our guidance for the next quarter is a make-up of many different types of options across our market segment. We feel confident in terms of that rollout as we provided the guidance today and we'll just have to see how that pans out. With the expectation that we will be flat or slightly down for the full year, you are correct in some case that we're going to have to build up to that over the course of the several next quarters. Likely, the second half of the year will definitely be stronger than the first half of the year, and that is our expectation at this time.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Tim, one of the things to keep in mind is that we have four growth drivers. We have four growth businesses. Our data center business is growing. It's unquestionably that our footprint is larger than ever. Our ProVis business is growing. Our workstation business now has three ways to grow. One is rendering. The second is data scientists are now a workstation customer that has never happened before. And our software stack with Turing in terms of workstation into an ideal data science workstation. And the third is finally we're able to make workstations into notebooks and they're delightfully thin, using all the same technologies that talked about for gaming notebooks and so workstations is a growth business. And then lastly, our automotive is going to be a gross growth business. We've been investing, as you know, in self-driving cars. And this year we announced entry into level two plus, our first foot into the mainstream marketplace of autonomous vehicles. And the first design win is Volvo and we have others to announce. And so I think this is going to be a good year for self driving cars as well. So we have four growth businesses, our four core businesses are all growing.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: First, I wanted to get the mix, this is question Colette. You had said that mix was going to be the primary driver of your gross margins. And I know that sequentially, they're up. But if I correct for the inventory write down in Q4, the normalized gross margin this quarter was 61.7. And so you're guiding it to 59, so it's down 270 basis points sequentially on flat revenues. So do I take from that guidance if that's an indicator of the mix between the businesses is the primary driver of that gross margin degradation, or is there's something else going on that we should be aware of?\nColette Kress: We'll start with that first question on gross margin. You're correct mix is still the primary driver of our gross margin every single quarter. You've correctly reduced or changed our Q4 numbers to remove the overall inventory write down. So when you look at Q1, there is a mix around our products that we plan on shipping by platforms. But also within our gaming business and within our data center business, we also have different gross margins that would influence. These are our best estimates of what we have at this time and we'll see as we move through the year.\nStacy Rasgon: So what do you think the bigger between those two, whether it's intra business mix or inter business mix, between the businesses or within the businesses. Which one of those is the biggest driver of the gross margin degradation sequentially into Q1?\nColette Kress: I think it's more on the inter pieces. Now keep in mind our Q4 had a very low percentage of gaming as a total in terms of there and then different mix within there as we moved in the next quarter as well.\nStacy Rasgon: So you think it's the mix between the businesses within, like you said, inter. Is that mix between the businesses that you think is the bigger drive there?\nColette Kress: The mix of the intra, both within the segment as well as between the segments.\nStacy Rasgon: For my follow-up, Jen-Hsun you and Colette, you mentioned the data center was growing. But if I've got full year revenues for the flat to down slightly and I've got gaming revenues down a bit like you said, and I have ProVis and auto growing. It's really hard within the envelope that guidance to get data centers growing much if at all. I mean, it could even be down within that. I mean how are you thinking about the idea of data center growing within the context of the full year guidance that you're given?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, in the short-term, in the near-term, we have relatively limited visibility. We don't think it's going to remain this way. And with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year. And so we'll just see how it turns out. This is our year guidance for now and we'll update you as we go. The fundamental dynamics doesn't change. The fact of the matter is that world needs more computing. And a lot of that computing is related to machine learning, data analytics, deep learning. It's related to the things that we're working on. And we have four new ways to grow our data center business. I think our deep learning position is as good as ever. Our scientific computing position is as good as ever. And we have four new ways to grow; we have inference, we have data analytics and machine learning, we have rendering and now we're taking that entire stack to the enterprise. And so I think we have the right strategy, we have the best platform and the utilization, the utility of it is really fantastic. And so with a little bit of tailwind, I think we could have a fairly good year and we\u2019ll just report it as we go.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: I wanted to ask about again competition and data center. AMD on their call had talked about graphics in their data center business being, biggest server which is worth north of $100 million a quarter, which surprised me. My sense is they're doing quite a bit different applications than you guys are. But maybe just give us some context around what they're doing and how you see the competition coming from within other graphics vendors?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our data center business is really focused on computing and we don't see anybody. Our primary competitor is CPUs. That's really the starting of it and the ending of it. And it's very clear. The vast majority of the world's data center only runs on CPUs today. But the advance of technology has slowed and it's creeping along at a few percent a year and unfortunately, that's just not good enough. And so either data centers are going to continue to increase in CapEx, or they're going to have to find a new approach. And I think people are fairly enthusiastic about university, about accelerated computing. And I think our position is really quite good. And so I would say that those are largely the positions. If you think about competitively comparing our GPU to a competitor's latest GPU, I think the expectation was really high and didn't turn out quite that way. I think we've established -- the Turing energy efficiency is much better. I think we've established that NVIDIA\u2019s tensor core architecture as a result allows our Volta to be four times the performance of the highest end of the alternative. And the T4 is one fourth the power at the same performance. And so the benefit of having great architectural advantage, a really rich software stack and an engineering that resulted in the energy efficiency that we've achieved generation in and generation out, I think those are those are really great advantages. And then lastly, because of the broad reach of our architecture, an OEM or a cloud service provider can adopt to our architecture and the utility of it's going to be greater, because there's just a lot more applications. And the best way to reduce costs for any utility is to increase its utility. And I think that our position there is really strong as you could imagine.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: I have just a couple of questions. The first one Jen-Hsun, it seemed like the Turing platform is delivering some amazing results but as you talked about relying on some new software features to do it. I wonder if you might talk about any steps you're taking in the roadmap to really upgrade performance for the installed base of games, and given the time that it might take for some of those software features to rollout? And then secondly, you noted in the pre-announcement something about the write down having to do with DRAM. I mean obviously that commodity pricing has been volatile. Colette, is there anything you can talk about how big of an effect that might have on the business and on pricing overall? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, the Turing architecture is the highest performing architecture at every single price point. And it's a big jump from our last generation in every single way. Without ray-tracing the Turing architecture is the first GPU to do concurrent floating point and image your operations at the same time. The instruction per clock of the Turing processor is so much better than our last generation, so much better than what's available in the marketplace. The cash architecture is a big improvement, and you can just see it in all of the existing games. So just measure the existing games without touching anything, Turing gives you a big boost and that's before we talked about ray-tracing. And we've already spoken about ray-tracing earlier Matt and we know that every single game that are coming out, we're working with the developers to incorporate RTX technology and a very, very big deal, both Epic with Unreal Engine and Unity Engine are going to incorporate ray-tracing. It is very, very clear that the next generation of computer graphics is ray-tracing. And all of the work that we've done with RTX to move the industry forward is well worth it. But remember that's just the graphics part of Turing. Turing comes with its several new opportunities for growth for us; the first is of course, advancing games; advancing games for notebooks; advancing computer graphics photorealistic rendering for film; all the work that we've done with Tensor Core that we just talked about. It's our second generation Tensor Core making it great for training, as well as inference, a big leap for us for inference. And then lastly all the work that we're doing for data analytics and machine learning will take advantage of all of the capabilities of Turing. And so Turing is a big deal for us. And that's one of the reasons why last year was so busy for us. As we put Turing into workstations, into data centers, into clouds, into rendering, into video games. And so Turing is really a gigantic leap for us architecturally, we're really excited by it. I think the turbulent Q4 overshadowed all of it but in the final analysis, I think Turing was a home run for us.\nColette Kress: And to also answer your question regarding DRAM prices, yes, they have definitely been volatile over the historical period. It is great to see them coming down in price. Over the long-term, yes, that is beneficial to us from a gross margin perspective. So as we look out to the quarters or later, we will probably be able to incorporate that into our gross margin.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Building on the discussion around the Turing platform and particularly to the gaming market, I'm curious you mentioned in your prepared comments pricing of these new solutions is a bit of an inhibitor. Has the company invoked any changes in your pricing strategy around Turing? And then also I'd be interested is, can you help us frame how important China is to the gaming segment and whether or not you're assuming that the China market rebounds in your annual assumptions?\nJen-Hsun Huang: First of all, on the pricing part, the biggest inhibitor was that we couldn't launch our mid range segment. The ability to launch 2060 was a big inhibitor for us, but we did so at CES. The launch is a great success. The reviews are fantastic. People love 2060, the price point is great. And so now we have great stack from the mid range all the way to enthusiasts. The other part, which because it turned out better is at the time of the launch, there were so many special additions and there were so many over clocked versions that the price point appeared high. But now we have MSRP pricing for all of our segments. And so that's terrific. China's an important market and it's an important gaming market. And I very confidence this is going to rebound.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis: Could you just -- a clarification. Could you repeat what you said you thought the OpEx would grow in this fiscal year? And what is the focus of that investment, to what extent this is R&D versus SG&A? And then maybe one layer deeper, where's the focus of the higher OpEx? Thank you.\nColette Kress: I'll start off to repeat what we indicated in our transcript. We plan to increase OpEx in the high single-digits over where we finished in terms of fiscal year '19. That is related to our opportunities that we see in front of us, gaming, AI as well as self driving cars. Our focus in terms of investments, we are a very R&D heavy significant company. But there are investments across the board, both in R&D as well as what we need in terms of go to market strategies to obtain these high markets in front of us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves: So I don't want to poke too many holes on the memory side and the downturn in gaming due to crypto inventory. But if I think about the gross margin profile, you guys almost reached 65%. So if I look out let's call it a year or even 18 months to make it more of a long-term target. Is there any reason why you guys can't get back up to the mid 6s level?\nColette Kress: On your gross margin question, yes we still have drivers within the mix of our products that allow us to grow our gross margin over the long-term absolutely. And there is definitely a goal for us to continue doing that. So we will focus in terms of both the cost components of what we do, but also moving the entire portfolio to the higher value added platforms that we sell. So over the long term, absolutely all of those things are still in place and intact that we can do. And we'll look quarter-to-quarter to give the best guidance that we can to help you see that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis: Obviously, a pause in data center particularly with the hyperscale, it's pretty well documented. And just curious your perspective particularly being AI still growth area versus more run rate being memory and CPUs. Can you give us any perspective as to how widespread is maybe number of customers or geographic perspective, and just curious how AI is affected with this greater slow down? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Blayne, the hyperscalars, their pause is probably the most dramatic. We still see a lot of activity in enterprise. It's just a much smaller base for us but we expect it to be a much larger base in the future. And the reason for that is because most of the enterprises today don't use deep learning, they use an approach called machine learning. They might use things like decision trees, or graph analytics, or regressions, or clustering, or things like that, algorithms like that. And they run data analytics applications for business intelligence on large amounts of data, and they might be running it on top of a spark stack that was created out of Berkeley and open source from Databricks. And so there's -- if you recognize some of these things, that's what healthcare companies do and financial services companies do, and retail companies do. They use it for fraud detection, predicting inventory, trying to make the best matches between riders and drivers, and try to predict which route to take to deliver food dinner to you. And so those applications most of the developers today use machine learning and large big data analytics. So we invested in the stack called RAPIDS and built our architecture, called T4. And we're in the process of partnering with large IT companies to take the stack and the solution out to the world's enterprise. And so, I expect enterprise to be a fairly exciting growth opportunity for us. Meanwhile, the CSPs, their pause will end. The amount of computation they do is increasing. More and more of them are using deep learning. And we have inference opportunity with the work that we do with T4 and TensorRT. And so we've got a lot of exciting opportunities to go.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\nPierre Ferragu: A question for Colette, I'm trying to figure out how your position with cloud data centers evolved last year in financial year 2019. So if I look at the cloud CapEx, we are up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business, did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you go faster than overall CapEx? And then I have a follow up on 2020.\nColette Kress: Let me start out on that piece. As we talked about earlier on the call, our hyperscales and our hyperscales many of them are also cloud providers did start to slowdown in terms of their purchasing in latter half of the year. But the overall growth rate as you can see from our data center business grew more than 50% for the full year. Now even without strong growth, we are still a very small percentage of overall CapEx that we see in the cloud providers or the overall hyperscales. We are likely one of their top priorities of areas of where they need to grow in terms of in their data center as they focus on AI, as they focus on the cloud businesses, and the importance of that compute is necessary. But we're still a very, very small percentage of it. So slowdown in the second half of the year, full year growth, phenomenal growth of 50% and we track with that for this year.\nPierre Ferragu: But this 50% growth, that's all your overall data center business. Is that's what like specifically your cloud hyperscale business grew well or did that grew even faster with that?\nColette Kress: Yes, depending on the quarter, we will have a mix of what is hyperscale growth or what is cloud in this. And again in the fourth quarter that was not a growth opportunity for us but earlier in the year definitely it was.\nPierre Ferragu: And then quickly maybe Jen-Hsun on 2020, so you seem to be very cautious on the data center outlook. When we listen to players like Google and Facebook and others, they all seem to be seemed like very tuned to grow their overall spending this year. And when we listen to other providers around you, they all seem to be -- they all demonstrate a bit of a confidence that in the second half, spending should resume. Is that just because I've been more optimistic than you? Do they say something you don't see? What do you hear from your clients about the second half?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, we're enthusiastic about the second half. We're enthusiastic about our position. And we're enthusiastic about the solution we offer. And Pure, as you know, we've also expanded our application and our market reach. We guided I think probably the biggest takeaway is we guided flat to slightly down for the whole year, for the whole number. We do have four growth drivers. And maybe the best way to think about it is we should just wait and see how it goes. I think we concerned with where we are. I feel pretty good about our guidance, but I feel even better about our strategic position. And so I look forward to working through the year with you guys.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\nHarlan Sur: On the China gaming weakness, is it the slower economic environment or is it government policy related? Because we know that the Chinese government has had a freeze on new gaming approvals, probably recently started to approve new games. This ban is in place I think since the first half of last year. So given what you know the business, how much of the China weakness is coming from China gaming bans versus just overall slower economic environment?\nJen-Hsun Huang: I don't know that we could tear that apart, tease that apart, Harlan. We just know that, the China, the consumer market is relatively slow towards the end of the year. And the China economy is in the final analysis of growth economy. And so we're looking forward to it recovering. And gaming is one of the most important pass-times of their culture and so I'm excited about our prospects there. All the things that we're seeing in the near-term, Colette has done a really good job of describing and as we leave the bottom and leave this inventory issue behind us, we're super well positioned. We have a full stack of RTX. The Turing architecture is fantastic. It is unquestionably the best in the world. We have the best performance at every single price point. And we have great notebooks that the market can now buy. And so I'm looking forward to reporting our status with you guys as the year goes on. It should be a good year.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: 2018 was a record year but it was a disappointing finish. This quarter, we expect to put the channel inventory issue behind us and get back on track. As the pioneer of accelerated computing, our position is unique and strong. And the opportunities ahead in graphic, high performance computing, AI and autonomous machines remain enormous. We are as enthusiastic about these growth opportunities as ever. Thanks everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 3, "year": 2019, "date": "2018-11-15 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Kelsey, and I'm your conference operator for today. Welcome to NVIDIA's financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions]\n I'll now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin your conference. \nSimona Stefan Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. It's also being recorded. You can hear a replay by telephone until November 22, 2018. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.\n During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.

Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.\n During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.\n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Colette. \nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue reached $3.18 billion, up 21% from a year earlier, with all 4 of our market platforms growing double digits. Data center, professional visualization and automotive all hit record levels. However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize. \n Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipments in the midrange Pascal segment to allow channel inventory to normalize. In Q4, we also expect minimal sales of Tegra chips for game consoles due to the normal seasonal build cycle. While channel inventory situation presents a near-term headwind, it does not change our long-term fundamentals. Our competitive position is as strong as ever, and we have expanded our addressable market with Turing and our recent software announcements. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars.\n GAAP gross margins grew 90 basis points year-on-year and non-GAAP gross margins rose 130 basis points. This reflects our continued shift toward higher-value platforms but also included a $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff of crypto mining demand. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 million for the fourth consecutive quarter. \n From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 25% from a year ago to $2.77 billion. Tegra processor revenue was down 3% to $407 million.\n Let's continue with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.76 billion was up 13% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by initial sales of our new Turing-based GPUs as well as strong notebook sales, which more than offset gaming console declines. In mid-September, we began shipping GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on our Turing architecture. Turing RTX technology delivers up to 2x the performance of its predecessor, Pascal, and 6x more for ray-traced graphics. These are the biggest generational jumps we have ever delivered in gaming GPUs.\n The first 2 GeForce RTX gaming cards to hit the shelves were the 2080 Ti and the 2080, delivering 4K HDR gaming and 60 frames per second on even the most advanced AAA titles, a major milestone for gamers. This is quickly becoming the new performance baseline as 4K displays are now reaching affordable price points. These 2 end -- 2 high-end cards were quickly followed by the rollout of the GeForce [ 27 D ]. NVIDIA RTX technology brings games to life like never before. The highly anticipated Battlefield V launched this week with the first release of RTX ray-tracing, enabling lifelike reflections on GeForce RTX GPUs. With a pipeline of upcoming games supporting NVIDIA RTX features, RTX is well on its way to establishing itself as a game-changing architecture.\n Although the cryptocurrency wave has ended, the channel has taken longer than expected to normalize. Pascal high-end cards have largely sold through ahead of RTX. However, on midrange Pascal gaming cards, both channel prices and inventory levels remained higher than expected. Pascal is well positioned as the GPU of choice in the midrange for the holidays, and we expect to work down channel inventories over the next quarter or 2.\n Moving to data center. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $792 million, up 58% year-on-year and up 4% sequentially. Demand remains strong for Volta architecture products, including Tesla V100 and VGX systems, and our inference business continued to grow, benefiting from the launch of the Turing T4 Cloud GPU during the quarter. Just 2 months after its launch, the T4 has received the fastest adoption of any server GPU. It is integrated into 57 server designs and it is already on the Google Cloud Platform, its first cloud availability. The T4 delivers world record performance for deep learning inference and accelerates diverse cloud workloads, including high-performance computing, deep learning training and inference, machine learning, data analytics and graphics.\n We also announced an updated TensorRT software stack and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Platform. This new software includes 2 critically important capabilities that can drive deployment of the NVIDIA inference platform at scale in hyperscale data centers. First, it enables multiple models and multiple frameworks to run on the same GPU at the same time. This can drive higher data center utilization, directly translating to significant savings. Second, it integrates with Kubernetes, the leading orchestration layer for hyperscale data centers.\n Completing our inference platform, the new T4 GPU delivers 12x the peak inference performance of its T4 predecessor. All told, our inference platform delivers 40x faster performance in CPUs. And with the TensorRT software stack, it is ideally suited for hyperscale data centers. With this launch, NVIDIA is poised to take the data center inference market, targeting every server node in the hyperscale data centers.\n Another important launch for the quarter was the NVIDIA RTX Server reference architecture, which incorporates up to 8 Turing-based RTX 8000. With this product, Turing opens a new market to GPOs, photoreal rendering or the creation of computer-generated images that look real. Rendering is instrumental to large industries, such as media and entertainment, retail, product designs, manufacturing and architecture. Yet prior to Turing and its ray-tracing capabilities, GPUs were not able to address this workload. So most rendering at -- up to this point has been done on CPUs. An RTX-accelerated render farm compared with an equivalent performance CPU render farm is 1/4 the cost, 1/10 the space and 1/11 the power. NVIDIA's RTX platform has garnered major industry support, including from key developers such as Adobe, ANSYS, Autodesk, Dassault and many others.\n Lastly, NVIDIA announced a GPU acceleration platform for data science and machine learning called RAPIDS, which enables companies to analyze massive amounts of data and make accurate business predictions at unprecedented speed. Up until now, data analytics and machine learning has been the largest high-performance computing applications not to have been accelerated. Virtually all enterprise use data analytics to extract insight from big data for a wide range of use cases, such as predicting credit card fraud, forecasting retail inventory and understanding customer buying behavior. RAPIDS is an open source suite of libraries for GPU-accelerated analytics, machine learning and, soon, data visualization. With RAPIDS, NVIDIA GPUs can now accelerate machine learning, as we have done with deep learning, with performance up to 50x faster than CPUs. The RAPIDS launch opens up a $20 billion server market used for data analytics and machine learning workloads to GPUs, and it's received broad industry support, including from Oracle, IBM, SAP, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure machine learning, Google, Q-Flow as well as the open source community.\n With one unified architecture and ecosystem, NVIDIA GPUs can address the redefined high-performance computing market, including scientific computing, deep learning and machine learning. Our GPUs and software stack accelerate a broad and diverse set of workloads, ranging from scale-up software in supercomputers to scale out deployments in hyperscale data centers. Just earlier this week, this capability was on display at Supercomputing Conference in Dallas, where the number of systems on the TOP500 supercomputer list using NVIDIA GPUs jumped 48% from last year, including the #1 and #2 systems in the world.\n Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached a record $305 million, up 28% versus the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Strength extended across the desktop and mobile as well as several key industries, including the public sector, manufacturing and architecture, engineering and construction. \n At SIGGRAPH in August, we announced our Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs based on the Turing architecture. And earlier this week, we introduced the Quadro RTX 4000, the most advanced professional GPU priced under $1,000. These GPUs will revolutionize the work of 50 million designers and artists by enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real-time and leveraging AI in their workflows. The Quadro RTX series started shipping in Q3, with the server-grade, high-end products recognized in data center. We already engaged with a range of customers on RTX, including the major movie studios and game developers, and the reaction has been very positive.\n Finally, turning to automotive. Automotive sales in Q3 reached $172 million, up 19% from a year ago and up 7% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagement in addition to the ramp of next-generation, AI-based cockpit infotainment systems.\n At GTC Europe, we announced that Volvo Cars selected NVIDIA's DRIVE AGX Xavier next-generation -- for next-generation Volvo Cars. The initial production release slated for the early 2020s will deliver Level 2+ assisted driving features, integrating 360-degree surround perception and a driver monitoring system. This is our first Level 2 mass-market car design win. In addition to Volvo, global automotive suppliers, Continental and Veoneer, announced that they have selected NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for their autonomous driving systems. Lastly, our DRIVE AGX Xavier development kit started shipping in this quarter. This is the world's first autonomous driving platform, and it can run our NVIDIA DRIVE software for autonomous driving, including data collection, 360-degree surround perception, advanced driver monitoring and in-vehicle visualization. With this platform, customers have developed and test their autonomous driving solutions and then easily move into production. We are excited about the AV opportunity as we look into next year and beyond.\n Moving to the rest of the P&L and the balance sheet. Q3 gross margins was 60.4% and non-GAAP was 61%, below our outlook due to the $57 million charge for prior architecture components and chips following the sharp falloff in crypto demand. GAAP operating expenses were $863 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $730 million, up 28% year-on-year. We continue to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, data center and automotive. \n GAAP net income was $1.23 billion, and EPS was $1.97, up 48% from a year earlier. GAAP net income benefited from the reduction of $138 million in our U.S. tax reform transition tax amount as well as other discrete tax items. Non-GAAP net income was $1.15 billion and EPS was $1.84, up 38% from a year ago, reflecting revenue growth and gross margin expansion as well as lower income tax expense. \n Accounts receivable was $2.22 billion compared to $1.66 billion in the prior quarter as Turing's RTX shipments began in the latter part of the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $1.42 billion compared to $1.09 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the ramp in production of Turing products.\n Quarterly cash flow from operations was $487 million. Capital expenditures were $150 million. This fiscal year, we have returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through the end of Q3. We've announced a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 effective in Q4 of fiscal 2019. We are also pleased to announce an increase of $7 billion to our share repurchase authorization and that we intend to return an additional $3 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2020.\n With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As noted earlier, our revenue outlook is impacted by the expected work-down of Pascal midrange gaming card inventory in the channel. In addition, we expect a decline in our gaming console revenue given seasonal build patterns. Keep in mind that the midrange desktop portfolio is typically about 1/3 of our gaming business. Our outlook assumes that channel inventory weeks approach normal levels exiting Q4 and that gaming and demand increases in Q4 compared with Q3.\n Now in total, we expect revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.3% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $915 million and $755 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $21 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $190 million to $210 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. \n In closing, I'd like to highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6, and we will be meeting with the financial community at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 8 through 11. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 will take place on February 14.\n With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Within your guidance for the January quarter, is the team anticipating continued sequential growth in your data center business? There seems to be some concern around a near-term slowdown in cloud spending. But on the flip side, we're hearing that the NVIDIA team is actually seeing pretty strong demand, near term, from some of your China cloud customers for your Tesla-based products. So I just wanted to get your views on cloud data center dynamics and the trajectory into the January quarter. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, we expect to continue to do well in data centers. The -- if you look at the background of what's happening, we know that Moore's Law has ended. And while demand for computing continues to grow and more and more of the data center is running machine learning algorithms, which is computationally really intensive, the only way to increase computational demand -- or computational resource is to buy more computers, buy more CPUs because each one of those CPUs aren't getting much faster. And so as a result of that, the data center CapEx would have to go up. The alternative, which is the alternative that we offer and is one of the reasons why the adoption of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform is growing so fast, is because the approach that we provide allows for a path forward beyond Moore's Law. There are several things that we have done this last quarter that I think is really fantastic. The first is the introduction of a new computing platform, new accelerated platform called RAPIDS. And as you know very well that the vast majority of the industry today, although are super excited about deep learning, deep learning as a method for artificial intelligence is very data-intensive. And in areas where there's a lot of domain expertise, where there's -- whether it's in retail or whether it's in financial services or health care, logistics, there's a fair amount of domain expertise, and the amount of data that they have to fuse together to train a model is quite high. The approach using traditional machine learning is quite successful. That has never been accelerated before. And we worked with the open source community over the course of the last several years to pull together an entire stack that starts from Apache Arrow, the Dask parallel distributed computing engine, and then all of our CUDA and all of our algorithms that run on top of that. We now have an accelerated machine learning platform. That's a brand-new platform, and the excitement around that is really quite incredible. The second thing is the Turing architecture allows us to do film rendering at a much, much more affordable way than Moore's Law would have allowed. And then the third, which we just announced recently, is our first Turing-based T4 Cloud GPU. And along with all of the software stack that we've put on top of it, Kubernetes, the Docker, the TRT inference engine, our second-generation Tensor Core, AI accelerator, all of that together has created a lot of excitement in data center. So I'm expecting our data center business to be -- to continue to do quite well. \nHarlan Sur: Great. And then just on the high-end Turing products that the team started rolling out in October, early demand actually seems to be quite strong. And I think part of it is just the lineup of AAA-rated games. eSports continue to be strong as well, obviously a big motivator for your enthusiast-class gamers. I know the team is, near term, kind of working down midrange Pascal cards, but do you anticipate your Turing-based RTX product families to drive sequential growth in the January quarter just what appears to be pretty strong demand pull for these products? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, the Turing launch happened towards the end of the quarter, and it's the biggest generational leap we've ever had. It introduced real-time ray-tracing. It's the first GPU to -- gaming GPU to include artificial intelligence. At every single price point it serves, it is substantially higher performance than the last and it's the highest performance GPU in the world. And all the great content are coming. Today, I think it is -- or yesterday, I think it was, the Battlefield V was released with real-time ray-tracing, the world's first application to support real-time ray-tracing. So I -- we expect Turing to do really well. As we go on, surely, we'll bring Turing deeper into the mainstream. And so we don't have anything to announce today, but as usual, we want to bring a brand-new architecture to as many gamers as possible. \nOperator: Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I had a question on the gaming outlook and as it relates to channel inventory. Colette, you mentioned that typically, the midrange is about 1/3 of gaming. How much was it in the October quarter? And are you effectively assuming close to 0 in the January quarter? And related to that, I think with your game console business, I'm estimating you did something around $200 million to $250 million in October. Again, is that coming down pretty hard into January? \nColette Kress: Yes. So I commented about the overall size of what we have traditionally seen in terms of the midrange over a fairly large period of time because keep in mind, the launches of products quarter-to-quarter have changed that. So it has been about 1/3 consistently over, let's say, about an 8-quarter period of time. And we think that's a good number for you to use as we look at our guidance in terms of Q4. From an overall console perspective, we again have seen about -- in the hundreds and sometimes more than that in prior quarters. What we're seeing is just a normal where they build ahead of the holidays in Q3, and that slows down as we move into Q4 when we're in the middle of the holidays. \nToshiya Hari: Great. And then as a follow-up, you saw nice acceleration in growth in your ProVis business this quarter. Jen-Hsun, I think you've talked extensively about the RTX and the long-term opportunity there. What are your expectations going into 2019 for that segment? \nJen-Hsun Huang: I expect ProVis to grow. The ProVis platform, more -- there's more content ever being created that is digitally created. And most photographs -- what appears to be photographs are rendered in software. Almost every catalog, every video, every movie, every TV show now has a great deal of digital rendering in it. And until now, it's not been possible to do the rendering in an accelerated way. So RTX is the world's first accelerated ray-tracing GPU, and the enthusiasm from the digital content creation market is really, really great. I surely expect that -- and as I was mentioning earlier, that it's been close to a decade that the workstation industry has not had a fundamental platform architecture change. And so RTX is the first one. So I'm expecting ProVis to do really well. \nOperator: Your next question is from Vivek Arya with Merrill Lynch. \nVivek Arya: I'm curious, Jen-Hsun, what needs to happen to work down this midrange Pascal inventory? Is it pricing? Is it something else? Because the thinking was that this could be cleared within the October quarter, but it hasn't. Do you think people were waiting for Turing to come out and maybe that created some kind of pause? And then as part of -- part B of that question, maybe Colette, how should we think about seasonality in the April quarter given that you mentioned it could take 1 or 2 quarters to work down this inventory? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, the -- well, we came into Q3 with excess channel inventory post the crypto hangover. We expected the pricing in the marketplace to decline. It declined slower than we expected and -- but while it was declining, we were expecting sales volume to grow, demand to grow and for pricing to be -- for volume to be elastic with pricing. I think it just took longer than -- the pricing took longer than we expected, and the volume increase took longer than we expected. At this point, most of the pricing has come down to its -- and slightly below its prelaunch levels. And so I'm hoping that -- I'm hopeful that now that pricing has stabilized, that customers will come back and buy. I guess when pricing is volatile in the channel, it probably freezes some people waiting for prices to stabilize, and that took longer than we expected frankly. But now that it's at the right levels, our expectation is that the market will return to normal. 1060 is the #1 selling graphics card in the world, and we decided not to sell any more into the channel for the upcoming quarter to give the channel an opportunity to sell through the inventory it has. And so we'll keep our eyes on it, but our expectation is that inventory levels will come back to normal by the end of the quarter. \nColette Kress: Okay. Vivek, to answer your question also regarding Q1 in terms of what we're going to see in terms of the expectation, as the channel inventory normalizes at the end of Q4, we do believe going into Q1, we will be probably up from where we end in terms of Q4. So we won't follow that normal seasonality between Q1 and Q4. We do expect to be up as we go into Q1. \nOperator: You have a question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, a follow-up question on the channel inventory side. It looks like it's roughly $600 million kind of a drawdown here. And just curious, does that sound right? Number one. Number two, does that fit with what you are hearing from your channel partners in terms of what's excess? And then as part of that, are you drawing down inventory in the current quarter ahead of Turing architecture launch into the mainstream? \nJen-Hsun Huang: The last question, I'm not sure I understand. The -- I think the answer to your first question is yes. You framed it nicely. It's -- the answer is yes. The last question was what again? \nColette Kress: The last question was regarding our midrange. Is there any statement about future Turing products that were taken into account? \nJen-Hsun Huang: We -- yes, we haven't announced our future Turing product, but it would be expected for us to create a Turing GPU that serves the mainstream parts of the marketplace. And so we're not announcing anything, but it would be conventional of us to do that. \nChristopher Muse: I guess, the question was whether you were drawing down inventory perhaps below normalized levels in the current quarter. \nJen-Hsun Huang: No, we're really not shipping into the midrange segment of Pascal so that we give the channel an opportunity to sell through the product that has. And we would like to see channel inventory get normalized by the end of Q4, and then we'll get back to doing our work. \nOperator: Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. \nStacy Rasgon: My first one is for Colette. I just wanted to be a little more explicit. If I think about your business split into sort of gaming and non-gaming, are you looking for the non-gaming pieces in aggregate to grow sequentially into Q4? \nColette Kress: Stacy, yes. I think the answer to that is yes. In aggregate, yes, we do believe the rest of the business will grow sequentially. \nStacy Rasgon: Got it. I guess that fits with the kind of 1/3 you're talking because that implies the gaming down 30%-plus. So that is what your kind of a magnitude that you're thinking about at this point. \nColette Kress: That is correct. \nStacy Rasgon: Got it. For my second question, I just wanted to -- for the last several quarters, the idea that the channel could be getting full is not necessarily a new worry. And yet the last several quarters, you've been saying, like on this call, that you guys felt like you had a really good handle on the channel, and yet it seems like maybe that wasn't exactly the case. Can you give us a feeling, maybe a better feeling for what changed and when you saw it in the quarter? Was this something that happened kind of like late in the quarter that you realized it? Or did you go into the quarter knowing that the inventories were high and needed to be corrected? Like what happened? Because this tone is a little different from what we've heard over the last few earnings calls from you. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. The -- we were surprised, obviously. I mean, we're surprised by it, as anybody else. The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. Prices started to drift down, and we expected to come down much more quickly than it did and -- but -- and when it went down, we expected demand to come up much more quickly than it did. And so I think the channel wanted to protect its price. People were uncertain about crypto, and demand was uncertain about when the price will be stabilized. And so all of that uncertainty, I think, froze the market a little longer than we expected. Pricing is now down to below prelaunch normal levels. And so I am hopeful that we're going to see demand come back and the sell-through will happen through the holidays. And we're seeing that. And so that's -- the first one is that we -- just we didn't expect it either and we didn't realize the magnitude of it until towards the end of the quarter. What was the other question? Was there another question? I think that, that was it. \nOperator: Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: With regards to Turing ramp, I guess, how is that going relative to your expectations? It seems like availability is quite a bit better now. And where do you stand with DLSS support? I know you've announced a number of games that will have DLSS support by year-end. Like how many of those are already supporting that technology? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, the ramp is going great, and I think this is the biggest generational leap we've ever had. This is the most substantial new technology that computer graphics has seen in a decade. Real-time ray-tracing is something that everybody had dreamed about for a long time. It's never seen before. And today with Battlefield V, people are enjoying real-time ray-tracing for the very, very first time. And the images are beautiful. So the ramp is great. Of course, Turing ramped into -- towards the end of the quarter and into a much more different situation than any GPU of the past. But nonetheless, the demand on the high-end products are fantastic. The 2080 Tis are largely sold out. I think it's still sold out everywhere. And so I think that the demand is great. I'm expecting it to be just a fantastic new generation. In terms of the content, you saw the first one. FINAL FANTASY is also out. And we have a pipeline, about 30 of them. We're working hard on that. And so when they -- when these games get released, RTX will be enabled. But I will say one last thing, which is content aside, RTX is higher performing at the same price point than any graphics card on the planet. And so at every single graphics -- every single price point, it is the highest performing graphics card. So it is unambiguously the highest performance GPU in the world and then -- and of course, all of these great new features will be coming. \nOperator: Your next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. \nPierre Ferragu: I'm still trying to put my head around the magnitude of this channel inventory drawdown because if you don't ship like the midrange cards for a full quarter, that means your inventory today is more than a quarter, more than 12 weeks of sales. And so my first question would be, am I right thinking that? Are you available a full quarter of sales in inventories? \n And then my second question is while you are drawing down this inventories, I would have expected to see, like, the Turing high-end card, the 2080 and the 2080 Ti ramping in Q4. And it looks like, excluding the inventory, the rest of the business -- the rest of the GPU business in gaming would be more like flattish sequentially. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I'm trying to figure out what the first part of the question was. \nSimona Stefan Jankowski: The first question was whether the midrange of Pascal had more than 12 weeks of inventory, if it's going to take more than a quarter to bring it down. \nJen-Hsun Huang: I think the channel has more than 12 weeks of inventory between us and the other brand. One of the things that is hard to estimate is how much inventory the other brands have. And our quarter is 1 month later. And so whatever action we take, whatever we see in the channel is 1 month after their end of the quarter. The amount of inventory is not just us. It's also the other brands. And our ability to see the other brand's inventory is just much harder. We try our best to estimate it, but obviously, we didn't estimate it well enough. And so the answer to your question is yes, I think there's about -- from our perspective, about 12 weeks of our inventory to sell through at this point. \nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. \nMark Lipacis: The -- I was hoping you could contrast this product cycle transition to Turing to the product transition you had to Pascal. And is the only -- or is the main difference the crypto hangover? Or is there something else impacting the transition, do you think? I mean, you've described Turing as the greatest generational leap, and I'm wondering if that larger delta has an impact to the transition as well. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Turing is the highest performance GPU at every single price point. And so it played no role in its transition. It's all about crypto hangover. This is the new experience as we made this transition. If you look at Turing on -- just on the basis of Turing, it had a great launch. We ramped it at the end of the quarter, as we expected. It was back-end loaded, as we expected, and the ramp was great. Everybody did a great job. And the performance is fantastic, and the excitement is great. And so I think Turing's ramp was a big success. It's -- underneath Turing was choppy, as we're talking about. And we really didn't see that until towards the end of the quarter. And as we looked out into this quarter, this coming quarter, we came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is just not to ship any more products into this segment of the marketplace because there's a fair amount of inventory and let the channel sell through the midrange Pascals. And then a quarter's time, we'll get back to business. And so I think -- I knew this is surely a setback, and I wish we had seen it earlier, in the final analysis can't be exactly sure what we would have done different. But between the unexpected, unanticipated slow decline of pricing in the channel and even after the prices came down, it took a little longer than we expected for volume to kick up. And the other brand's inventory in the marketplace, those factors kind of compounded and made it a lot worse than we expected. \nOperator: You have a question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. \nAaron Rakers: Maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently on the gaming business. If I look back over the past several quarters, let's say you've been running at roughly a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion revenue level since the October '17 quarter. Prior to that, you were at $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We look like we're now going back to that level. I guess, the question is, do we build off of that level? Do we bring back half of the inventory burn? How do I think about the return of year-over-year growth in that gaming piece of the business as we start to look into fiscal 2020? \n And then a quick second question. Over the past few years, you've had really strong seasonal sequential growth in the data center business, in Q4, about 20% sequentially. I'm just curious, how is your guide factoring in the sequential growth in that piece of the business into this current quarter? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Okay. Let me take the second one first. Our data center business is doing great. I mean, the fundamental dynamics of accelerated computing is spot on. And with Moore's Law coming to an end, it's the path forward. Take a look at the number of systems in the TOP500, 127 systems, I think, this year was, a growth of nearly 50% year-over-year. We're the #1 system in United States and the world, in Europe, in Japan. We're 22 out of the top 25 most energy-efficient computers in the world. And then this quarter, we announced 3 new initiatives that's going to expand us into a broader part of the high-performance computing market with machine learning, which is -- as we know, is the largest part of artificial intelligence today, which has not been accelerated and now it is. The second is the ability to do rendering for film, photorealistic rendering for the first time. And then the third is a brand-new cloud GPU, we call T4, that the enthusiasm around it is just incredible. And from the time that we went to production to the time that Google put it in their cloud was literally 30 days. It's just an incredible speed of adoption. And so I expect T4 to do quite well. So I think our data center business dynamics are really quite great. In terms of forecast, we'll just see how it turns out. But I think the fundamental dynamics are great. Back to your question about gaming. \nColette Kress: So the statement came in regarding, you've bumped up the overall gaming somewhere in mid of the year to about a $1.7 billion gaming business, where maybe if you look back 2 years, you were at about $1.1 billion. At this stage, when you come out of the setback that we have here to get through the overall channel inventory, where will you come out after that? And what type of growth could we expect? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, I'm going to let you guys do the modeling, but let me just say this. There's nothing fundamentally different about the gaming market that we know. Cryptocurrency is an extraordinary factor that we all have to just internalize as it is. And we thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics. But when the prices came down -- started to come down and we hoped the demand would start to reflect the declining price, it just took longer than we expected. And that's what we're experiencing. In terms of the gaming marketplace, if you take a look at some of the dynamics, our notebook gaming, which is not affected by crypto, grew 50% year-over-year in China. And so the gaming market seems quite robust. RTX is going to unquestionably redefine gaming computer graphics. And so I think that the dynamics are good. We have to work through the channel inventories. This quarter, of course, we had the simultaneous decision of not shipping any more midrange products into the channel as well as seasonal -- normal seasonal console build plans. And they tend to build out a quarter before the holiday season. So you have these 2 simultaneous effects. But there's nothing about the gaming marketplace or the gaming business that we see that's fundamentally different. \nColette Kress: Yes. To kind of add to that, think about our gaming business in several pieces that we talked about in terms of the tremendous strength that is also continuing. In terms of our success in terms of Turing, our notebooks for gaming are growing extremely strong, and our overall console business is also extremely healthy as well. So to think about all of the different components, we just have a piece of channel inventory at the midrange, but overall, as you can see, gaming is also growing quite well. \nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. \nChristopher Caso: A question with regard to inferencing and what we can expect from that for both Q4 and going forward. And perhaps I don't know if it's a valid comparison to compare what we might expect from inferencing after the new Quadro launches to what happened in training after the Volta launches. Is there any comparison there in terms of magnitude for how the ramp goes? \nJen-Hsun Huang: The ramp of T4 is completely related to customers porting their model on top of our platform. And the inference model is really complicated. This is one of the things that I've talked about in the past that on the one hand, people think that inference appears to be simple because there are so many ASICs built being talked about. The vast majority of the complexity of inference is actually in the optimizing compiler on top. The TensorRT, fifth-generation optimizing compiler that we announced just recently took 3, 4 years to build. And then on top of that, in order to get it to scale as quickly as what people saw in Google -- Google's cloud requires us to build something called a TRT server, an inference server, that allows multiple models to run on top of Kubernetes in the cloud. That piece of software is also super complicated to write. And so the pieces of technology that we're putting together have come together. And now we're engaged with Internet companies around the world to port their most heavy workload applications on top -- or models on top of T4. And so we're working hard on that. And when that happens, it comes down to their decision of how many they would like to buy, and that tells us about our adoption rate. I think from a high-level perspective, if we step back for a second, the high-level -- the way to look at it is this: that we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end, and at the same time, we also know that more and more data centers are deploying deep learning models and machine learning models into their data center. And it's computationally really intensive. And at this time and as we look out into the horizon, the T4 Cloud GPU is just unquestionably the most effective. It can run models, whether it's an image model or a recommendation model or a speech synthesis model. It is the highest throughput processor in the world at 70 watts, which fits into a hyperscale data center OCP server. It is also the lowest latency of any processor at inferencing in the world at less than 1 millisecond. And so between the architecture, all of the software technology and all of the software capabilities we put in place and the fact that the conditions would suggest that Internet companies need an accelerated path forward, I think T4 is really well positioned. And I look forward to coming back and telling you guys about success. \nOperator: You have a question from Will Stein with SunTrust. \nWilliam Stein: First, Jen-Hsun, I appreciate all the details on the T4 for inference in the data center. Could you likewise highlight the current traction you're seeing and the long-term growth expectations for the Jetson product that's designed for really, I think, a different market? It's inference at the edge, right? \nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Jetson is designed for edge AI. One version of Jetson, which is a functional save, high-performance with a lot of complicated software, one version of that, you could say, is self-driving cars. And this quarter, we announced winning our first mass-market Level 2. We've been really successful in robot taxis and Level 4s and trucks and shuttles and high-end systems, where the number of processors, the number of sensors, the combination of LiDARs and surround cameras requires a lot of computation and -- but we've never been successful until now with taking the DRIVE platform all the way down to Level 2 mass-market cars. Volvo is our first announcement, our first win in high-volume, early 2020s production ramp. And I'm expecting many more. And I think we've positioned and created a solution that is both highly useful and easy to use as well as could deliver Level 2 capability in a single chip for the very first time. And Xavier is in production. It is the only single-chip, autonomous vehicle processor in production today. Then you take that same platform and you could apply to all kinds of other edge AI devices. It could be manufacturing picking robots. It could be autonomous retail, basically AI retail, and autonomous warehouses. So -- or medical instruments, medical imaging instruments that, in the device itself, recognizes and identifies anomalies. And so all of this type of applications are leaning towards AI, and that's the reason why we built Jetson. \nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. \nCraig Ellis: I'll ask a clarification and then a question. The clarification is just on the inventory issue, and thanks for all the color. But one, are Pascal 1070s and 1080s and in Ti flavors still selling? And if so, could they present any kind of inventory risk either later this year or in early fiscal '20? \n And then the question really, Jen-Hsun, is trying to get a better understanding of how you see the intermediate-term growth rate of the data center business. You had spectacular high-performance compute TOP500 accelerator penetration performance up 50-plus percent. That about matches the growth in the data center business. Those may be somewhat coincidental, but can you just talk about where you see penetration across key end markets like HPC, like cloud and hyperscale and like enterprise? Which offer you the best growth from here? And where do you feel like your penetration may be more mature? I'm just trying to get a sense if there's an acceleration coming off of the 50% year-on-year growth that we're seeing now or if, consistent with the recent trend, we might be moderating potentially down into the 40% or 30% range as we go into the next calendar year. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Our high-end Pascal GPUs are largely sold. And we did a fairly good job making sure that -- with that transition before we ramped up the high-end Turing products. The -- our data center business, I would say that Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3, this last quarter, the inventory setback aside, I actually have to say that it's one of the best quarter we've ever experienced. And the reason for that is because our data center position, our accelerated computing position as a company, which is the foundation of this company, the accelerated computing focus of our company expanded in really several ways. For the first part of our journey into accelerated computing, it was really following scientific computing, simulating first principle laws of physics for scientific computing and high-performance computing codes. About 5 years ago, deep learning came into the fore, and we were alert and agile to have invested a great deal and mobilized the company to go help the world put deep learning into software developers' hands all over the world. The area where I'm super excited about right now are the 3 that I've mentioned that we've opened up in this last quarter with the launch of Turing and with the launch of RAPIDS. The first is our film rendering opportunity is -- we think that there's about 10 million CPU nodes around the world that are used for film rendering. They can now benefit from accelerated computing as Moore's Law comes to an end. The second is opening up inference. The hyperscale data center marketplace is something along the lines of 15 million CPUs sold this year. And it was growing -- let's call it, growing at about 15% per year and -- the number of CPUs. And we know for a fact that Moore's Law has come to an end and those servers are going to have to be accelerated going forward. And so I think that T4 is just ideal for that. It was designed from the ground up to deliver computing in a very, very compressed and very condensed and power-sensitive environment, which these hyperscale data centers tend to be. And the software stack from Kubernetes to containers, to a TRT compiler, to the TRT inference server and our NGC cloud with all of the stacks fully accelerated and containerized in the cloud, certifying all of the major cloud providers around the world for our containers, that process took us several years and it's put us in a really great place. So T4 is really fantastic. And so that's -- the second segment of high-performance computing is deep learning. The third and potentially the largest currently is machine learning. This is where Hadoop goes. This is where Spark goes. This is where scikit-learn, Python, pandas. All of the data scientists around the world in retail, in transportation and logistics, in health care, in financial services that are using algorithms like random forest and XGBoost and k-nearest and k-means and PCA and all of these different buzzwords have never had the opportunity to have accelerated computing until now. And this took a couple, 2, 3 years for us to pull together. RAPIDS has been open sourced. You can go into the NGC cloud, download it. IBM is going to integrate it into their machine learning platform. SaaS, SAP, Oracle, the cloud providers are all integrating the RAPIDS open source SDK into their machine learning platform. And so this is a new segment for us. \n The answer about our growth rate is, I believe, that our accelerated computing, our data center opportunity has significantly expanded during the quarter. Between the T4 hyperscale cloud GPU and RAPIDS machine learning platform, it has -- and our RTX server film rendering, we surely have expanded our data center opportunity. And so I fully expect us to continue to do well in accelerated computing for data centers. \nOperator: Unfortunately, we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks. \nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, everyone. To sum up, the crypto hangover has left the industry with excess inventory -- excess channel inventory. It will take 1 or 2 quarters to work through it. This is an unexpected near-term setback and doesn't change the fundamental dynamics of our company. The end of Moore's Law has cleared a way for NVIDIA accelerated computing as a great path forward. Turing opens up 3 exciting markets for us with ray-tracing games, film rendering and hyperscale inference. And with our first win in mainstream Level 2 self-driving cars with Volvo, our DRIVE AV platform is gearing up for the mass market, and our competitive position has never been stronger. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for joining.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. This is a big week for NVIDIA. We just announced the biggest leap in GPU architecture in over a decade. We can\u2019t wait to tell you more about it. But first, let\u2019s talk about the quarter. We had another strong quarter, led by Datacenter and Gaming. Q2 revenue reached $3.12 billion, up 40% from a year earlier. Each market platform, Gaming, Datacenter, Pro Visualization, and Automotive hit record levels with strong growth, both sequentially and year-on-year. These platforms, collectively grew more than 50% year-on-year. Our revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million, while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million, and we now expect a negligible contribution going forward. Gross margins grew nearly 500 basis points year-on-year, while both GAAP and non-GAAP net income exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. Profit nearly doubled. From a reporting segment perspective, GPU revenue grew 40% from last year to $2.66 billion. Tegra Processor revenue grew 40% to $467 million. Let\u2019s start with our Gaming business. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up 52% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially. Growth was driven by all segments of the business with desktop, notebook, and gaming consoles up all strong double-digit percentages year-on-year. Notebooks were standout this quarter with strong demands for thin and right form factors, based on our Max-Q technology. Max-Q enables gaming PC OEMs to pack a high-performance GPU into a slim notebook that is just 20 millimeters thick, or less. All major notebook OEMs and ODMs have adopted Max-Q for their top of the line gaming notebooks, just in time for back-to-school. And we expect to see 26 models, based on Max-Q, in stores, for the holidays. The gaming industry remains vibrant. The eSports audience now approaches 400 million, up 18% over the past year. The unprecedented success of Fortnite and PUBG has popularized this new Battle Royale genre, and expanded the gaming market. In fact, the Battle Royale mode is coming to games like the much anticipated Battlefield 5. We are thrilled to partner with EA to make GeForce the best PC gaming platform for the release of Battlefield 5 in October. We\u2019ve also partnered with Square Enix to make GeForce the best platform for its upcoming Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Monster Hunter World arrived on PCs earlier this month, and it was an instant hit. And many more titles are lined up for what promises to be a big holiday season. It\u2019s not just new titles that are building anticipation. The gaming community is excited of the Turing architecture, announced earlier this week at SIGGRAPH. Turing is our most important innovation since the invention of the CUDA GPU, over a decade ago. The architecture includes new, dedicated ray-tracing processors or RT Cores, and new Tensor Cores for AI inferencing which together will make real-time ray-tracing possible for the first time. We will enable the cinematic quality gaming, amazing new effects powered by neural networks and fluid interactivity on highly complex models. Turing will reset the look of video games and open up the 250 billion visual effects industries to GPUs. Turing is the result of more than 10,000 engineering years of effort. It delivers up to 6x performance increase over Pascal for ray-traced graphics and up to 10x boost for peak inference swaps. This new architecture will be the foundation of new portfolio of products across our platforms going forward. Moving to Datacenter. We had another strong quarter with revenue of $760 million, accelerating to 83% year-on-year growth and up 8% sequentially. This performance was driven by hyperscale demand as internet services used daily by billions of people increasingly leverage AI. Our GPUs power real-time services such as search, voice recognition, voice synthesis, translation, recommender engines, fraud detection, and retail applications. We also saw growing adoption of our AI and high-performance computing solutions by vertical industries, representing one of the most fastest areas of growth in our business. Companies and sectors ranging from oil and gas to financial services to transportation are harnessing the power of AI and our accelerated computing platform to turn data into actionable insights. Our flagship Tensor Core GPU, the Tesla V100, based on Volta architecture continued to ramp for both AI and high-performance computing applications. Volta has been adopted by every major cloud provider and hyperscaledatacenter operator around the world. Customers have quickly moved to qualify the new version of V100, which doubled the on-chip DRAM to 32 gig to support much larger data sets and neural networks. Major server OEMs, HP Enterprise, IBM, Lenovo, Cray and Supermicro also brought the V100 32 gig to market in the quarter. We should continue to gain traction with AI inference solution which helped expand our addressable market in the datacenter. During the quarter, we released our TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software for general availability. While prior versions of the TensorRT optimized image and video-related workloads, TensorRT 4 expands the aperture to include more use cases such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, translation, and recommendation systems. This means, we can now address a much larger portion of deep learning inference workloads, delivering up to 190x performance speed-up relative to CPUs. NVIDIA and Google engineers have integrated TensorRT into the TensorFlow deep learning framework, making it easier to run AI inference on our GPUs. And Google Cloud announced that NVIDIA Tesla P4 GPU, our small form factor GPU for AI inferenceand graphic virtualization is available on Google Cloud Platform. Datacenter growth was also driven by DGX, our fully optimized AI server which incorporates V100 GPUs, our proprietary high-speed interconnect and our fully optimized software stack. The annual run rate for DGX is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. DGX-2, announced in March at our GPU Technology Conference, is being qualified by customers and is on track to ramp in the third quarter. At GTC Taiwan in June, we announced that we are bringing DGX-2 technology to our HGX-2 server platform. We make HGX-2 available to OEM and ODM partners, so they can quickly deploy our newest innovations in their own server designs. In recent weeks, we announced partnerships with NetApp and Pure Storage to help customers speed AI deployment from month to days or even hours, with highly-integrated, optimized solutions that combine DGX with the company\u2019s all-flash storage offerings and third-party networking. At GTC Taiwan, we also revealed that we are -- set high speed records for AI training and inference influence. Key to our strategy is our software stack. From CUDA to our training and inference of SDKs as well as our work with developers to accelerate their applications. It is the reason we can achieve such dramatic performance gains in such a short period of time. And our developer ecosystem is getting stronger. In fact, we just passed 1 million members in our developer program, up 70% from one year ago. One of our proudest moments this quarter was the launch of the Summit AI supercomputer in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Summit is powered by over 27,000 Volta Tensor Core GPUs and helped the U.S. reclaim the number one spot on the TOP500 supercomputer list for the first time in five years. Other NVIDIA power systems joined the TOP500 list were Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the third spot and the ABCI Japan\u2019s fastest supercomputer in the fifth spot, NVIDIA now powers five of the world\u2019s seven fastest supercomputers, reflecting the broad shift in supercomputing to GPUs. Indeed, the majority of the computing performance added to the latest TOP500 list comes from NVIDIA GPUs and more than 550 HPC applications are now GPU accelerated. With our Tensor Core GPUs, supercomputers can now combine simulation with the power of AI to advance many scientific applications from molecular dynamics to seismic processing to genomics and material science. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue grew to $281 million, up 20% year-over-year and 12% sequentially, driven by demand for real-time rendering and mobile workstations, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. These emerging applications now represent approximately 35% of Pro Visualization sales. Strength extended across several key industries including healthcare, oil and gas, and media and entertainment. Key wins in the quarter include Raytheon, Lockheed, GE, Siemens and Phillips Healthcare. In announcing the Turing architecture at SIGGRAPH, we also introduced the first Turing-based processors, the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000 GPUs, bringing interactive ray-tracing to world, years before it\u2019s been predicted. We also announced that the NVIDIA RTX Server, a full ray-tracing global illumination rendering server that will give a giant boost to world\u2019s render firms as Moore\u2019s Law ends. Turing is set to revolutionized the work of 5 -- 50 million designers and artists, enabling them to render photorealistic scenes in real time and add new AI-based capabilities to the workflows. Private GPUs based on the Turing will be available in the fourth quarter. Dozens of leading software providers, developers and OEMs have already expressed support for Turing. Our ProViz partners view it as a game-changer for professionals in the media and entertainment, architecture and manufacturing industries. Finally, turning to Automotive. Revenue was a record $161 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. This reflects growth in our autonomous vehicle production and development engagements around the globe, as well as the ramp of next-generation AI-based, smart cockpit infotainment solutions. We continue to make progress on our autonomous vehicle platform with key milestones and partnerships announced this quarter. In July Daimler and Bosch selected DRIVE Pegasus as the AI brain for their level 4 and level 5 autonomous fleets. Pilot testing will begin next year in Silicon Valley. This collaboration brings together NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in AI and self-driving platforms, Bosch\u2019s hardware and systems expertise as the world\u2019s largest tier 1 automotive supplier, and Daimler\u2019s vehicle expertise and global brand synonymous with safety and quality. This quarter, we started shipping development systems for DRIVE Pegasus, an AI supercomputer designed specifically for autonomous vehicles. Pegasus delivers 320 trillion operations per second to handle diverse and redundant algorithms, and architected for safety as well as performance. This automotive grade, functionally safe production solution uses two NVIDIA Xavier SoCs and two next-generation GPUs, designed for AI and visual processing, delivering more than 10x greater performance and 10x higher data bandwidth compared to the previous generation. With co-designed hardware and software, the platform is created to achieve ASIL D ISO 26262, the industry\u2019s highest level of automotive functional safety. We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of automated and autonomous driving, from traffic jam pilots to level 5 robotaxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are using NVIDIA\u2019s automotive platform. With this growing momentum and accelerating revenue growth, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for autonomous driving business. This quarter, we also introduced our Xavier platform for Jetson for the autonomous machine market. With more than 9 billion transistors, it delivers over 30 trillion operations per second, more processing capability than a powerful workstation or using one-third the energy of a light bulb. Jetson Xavier establishes customers to deliver AI computing at the edge, powering autonomous machines like robots or drones with applications in manufacturing, logistics, retail, agricultural, healthcare and more. Lastly, in our OEM segment, revenue declined by 54% year-on-year and 70% sequentially. This was primarily driven by the sharp decline of cryptocurrency revenues to fairly minimal levels. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP was 63.5%, in line with our outlook. GAAP operating expenses were $818 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $692 million, up 30% year-on-year. We can continue to invest in the key platforms, driving our long-term growth including Gaming, AI and Automotive. GAAP net income was $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.76, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate near 7% compared to our outlook of 11%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.21 billion and EPS was $1.94, up 90% and 92%, respectively, from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength, as well as gross and operating margin expansion and lower taxes. Quarterly cash flow from operations was $913 million, capital expenditures were $128 million. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We are including no contribution from crypto in our outlook. We expect revenue to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.6% and 62.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $870 million and $730 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of $20 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, I\u2019d like to highlight some of the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 6th and meeting with the financial community at our GPU technology conferences in Tokyo on September 13th and Munich on October 10th. And our next earnings call to discuss our financial results is in the third quarter of 2019, will take place on November 15. We will now open the call for questions. If you could limit your questions to one or two? And operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis: The question is on ray-tracing. To what extent is this creating new markets versus enabling greater capabilities in your existing markets? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes, Mark. So, first of all, Turing, as you know, is the world\u2019s first ray-tracing GPU. And it completes our new computer graphics platform, which is going to reinvent computer graphics altogether. It unites four different computing modes rasterization, accelerated ray-tracing, computing with CUDA, and artificial intelligence. It uses these four basic methods to create imagery for the future. There\u2019s two different -- two major ways that we\u2019ll experience the benefits right-away. The first is for the markets of visualization today, they require photorealistic images. Whether it\u2019s a IKEA Catalog or movie, or architectural engineering, or product design, car design, all of these types of markets require photorealistic images. And the only way to really achieve that is to use ray-tracing with physically based materials and lighting. The technology is rather complicated, has been computing intensive for very long time. And it wasn\u2019t until now that we\u2019ve been able to achieve it in a productive way. And so, Turing has the ability to do ray-tracing, accelerated ray-tracing, and it also has the ability to combine very large frame buffers, because these data sets are extremely large. And so, that marketplace is quite large, and it\u2019s never been served by GPUs before, until now, all of that has been run on CPU render farms, gigantic render farms in all these movie studios and service centers and so on and so forth. The second area where you\u2019re going to see the benefits of ray-tracing, we haven\u2019t announced.\nMark Lipacis: Okay. If I could have a follow-up on the gaming side. Where do you think the industry is on creating content that leverages that kind of capability? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, Mark. At GTC this last year in March -- GDC and GTC, we announced a brand new platform called NVIDIA RTX. And this platform has those four computation methods that I described, for generating images. We put that platform out with the support of Microsoft. They call it the Microsoft DirectX Raytracing. And the major game engine companies, Epic has implemented real-time ray-tracing and the RTX into, the Unreal Engine. And at GDC and GTC, we demonstrated for the very first time on four Volta GPUs, on four Volta GPUs, the ability to do that. And it was the intention of - to get this platform out to all of the game developers. And we\u2019ve been working with game developers throughout this time. This week, at SIGGRAPH, we announced our Quadro, which is the first -- the Quadro RTX 8000, 6000 and 5000, the world\u2019s first accelerated ray-tracing GPUs. And I demonstrated one Quadro running the same application that we demonstrated on four Volta GPUsrunning in March. And the performance is really spectacular. And so, I think the answer to your question is, developers all have access to RTX. It\u2019s in Microsoft\u2019s DirectX; it\u2019s in the most popular game engine in the world; and you\u2019re going to start to see developers use it. On the workstation side, on the Professional Visualization side, all of the major ISVs have jumped on to adopt it. And at SIGGRAPH this year there, there you could see a whole bunch of developers demonstrating the NVIDIA RTX with accelerated ray-tracing, generating full realistic images. And so, I would say that no platform, in our history, has on day one of announcement, had so many developers jump onto it. And stay tuned. We\u2019ve got a lot more stories to tell you about RTX.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Colette, I had a couple of questions about inventory, the first of which is, I understand you\u2019ve launched a new product set in ProViz, and the Datacenter business is obviously ramping really strongly. But, if you look at the balance sheet, I think the inventory level is up by mid-30% sequentially and you\u2019re guiding revenue up 3% or so. Maybe you could help us sort of walk through the contributions of that inventory and what it might mean for future products? And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the gaming channel, in terms of inventory, how things are looking in the channel, as you guys see it, during this period of product transition? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for your questions. So, when you look at our inventory on the balance sheet, I think it\u2019s generally consistent with what you have seen over the last several months in terms of what we will be bringing to market. Turing is an extremely important piece of architecture, and as you know, it will be with us for some time. So, I think the inventory balance is getting ready for that. And don\u2019t forget, our work in terms of Datacenter and what we have for Volta is also a very, very complex computer in some cases in terms of what we have also in terms of there. So, just those things together, plus our Pascal architecture is still here, makes up almost all of what we have there in terms of inventory.\nJensen Huang: Matt, on the channel inventory side, we see inventory in the lower end of our stack. And that inventory is well-positioned for back-to-school and the building season that\u2019s coming up on Q3. And so, I feel pretty good about that. The rest of our product launches and the ramp-up of Turing is going really well. And so, I think the rest of the announcements we haven\u2019t made, but stay tuned. The RTX family is going to be a real game-changer for us. And the reinvention of computer graphics altogether has been embraced by so many developers. We\u2019re going to see some really exciting stuff this year.\nOperator: Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Actually, just a clarification, and then the question. On the clarification, Colette if you could also help us understand the gross margin sequencing from Q2 to Q3? And then, Jensen, how would you contrast the Pascal cycle with the Turing cycle? Because, I think in your remarks, you mentioned Turing is a very strong advancement over what you had before. But, when you launched Pascal, you had guided to very strong Q3s and then Q4s. This time, the Q3 outlook, even though it\u2019s good on an absolute basis, on a sequential and a relative basis, it\u2019s perhaps not as strong. So, could you just help us contrast the Pascal cycle with what we should expect with the Turing cycle?\nColette Kress: Let me start first with your question regarding gross margins. We have essentially reached, as we move into Q3, normalization of our gross margins. I believe, over the last several quarters, we have seen the impact of crypto and what that can do to elevate our overall gross margins. We believe we\u2019ve reached a normal period, as we\u2019re looking forward to essentially no cryptocurrency as we move forward.\nJensen Huang: Let\u2019s see. Pascal was really successful. Pascal, relative to Maxwell, was a leap in fact, and it was a really significant upgrade. The architectures were largely the same. They were both programmable shading. They were both at the same generation programmable shading. But Pascal was much, much more energy efficient, I think it was something like 30%, 40% more energy efficient than Maxwell. And that translated to performance benefits to customers. The success of Pascal was fantastic. There\u2019s just simply no comparison to Turing. Turing is a reinvention of computer graphics; it is the first ray-tracing GPU in the world; it\u2019s the first GPU that will be able to ray trace light in an environment and create photorealistic shadows and reflections and be able to model things like areal lights and global illumination and indirect lighting. The images are going to be so subtle and so beautiful, when you look at it, it just looks like a movie. And yet it\u2019s backwards compatible, with everything that we\u2019ve done. This new hybrid rendering model which extends what we\u2019ve built before but added to it two new capabilities artificial intelligence and accelerated ray-tracing is just fantastic. So, everything of the past will be brought along and benefits, and it\u2019s going to create new visuals that weren\u2019t possible before. We also did a good job on laying the foundations of the development platform for the developers. We partnered with Microsoft to create DXR, Vulkan RT is also coming, and we have OptiX that are used by ProViz renderers and developers all over the world. And so, we have the benefit of laying the foundation stack by stack by stack over the years. And as result, on the data that Turing comes out, we\u2019re going to have a richness of applications that gamers will be able to enjoy. You mentioned guidance. I actually think that on a year-over-year performance, we\u2019re doing terrific. And I\u2019m super excited about the ramp of Turing. It is the case that we benefited in the last several quarters from an unusual lift from crypto. In the beginning of the year, we thought and we projected that crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of year. But, at this time, we consider it to be immaterial for the second half. And so, that makes comparisons on a sequential basis -- on a I guess, quarterly sequential basis harder. But, on a year-to-year basis, I think we\u2019re doing terrific. Every single one of our platforms are growing, high-performance computing of course, Datacenters is growing. AI, the adoption continues to seep from one industry to another industry. The automation that\u2019s going to be brought about by AI, is going to bring productivity gains to industries like nobody has ever seen before. And now with Turing, we\u2019re going to be able to reignite the Professional Visualization business, open us up to photorealistic rendering for the very first time, render farms, and everybody who is designing products that has to visualize it photo realistically to reinventing and resetting graphics for video games. And so, I think we\u2019re in a great position, and I\u2019m looking forward to reporting Q3, when the time comes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Colette, I have a question on Datacenter. In your prepared remarks, you talked about AI and high-performance computing driving new verticals, and some of these verticals are fastest growing. Some of your peers have talked about enterprise spending slowing down in the back half of this year on sever unit demand, and you guys are not -- units play more of an AI adoption. Just curious in terms of your thinking about second half Datacenter growth.\nColette Kress: So, as you know, we generally give our view on guidance for one quarter out. You are correct that our Datacenter results that we see is always a tremendous, unique mix every single quarter in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. But, there\u2019s still some underlying points of that that will likely continue. The growth in terms of use by the hyperscales, continued industry-by-industry coming on-board, essentially just because the needs of accelerated computing for the workloads and for the data that they have is so essential. So, we still expect as we go into Q3 for Datacenter to grow, both sequentially and year-over-year. And we\u2019ll see probably a mix of both, selling our Tesla V100 platforms, but also a good contribution from DGX.\nJensen Huang: Yes. That\u2019s right. Atif, let me just add a little bit more to that. I think, the one simple way to think about that is this. In the transportation industry, let\u2019s take one particular vertical, there are two dynamics that are happening that are very, very abundantly clear, and that will double -- transform that industry. The first of course is ride hailing and ride sharing. Those platforms in order to make a recommendation of which taxi to bring to which passenger, which customer, is a really large computing problem. It\u2019s a machine learning problem; it\u2019s an optimization problem at very, very large scale. And in every -- in each and every one of those instances, you need high-performance computers to use machine learning to figure out how to make that perfect match, or the most optimal match. The second is self-driving cars. Every single car company that\u2019s working on robot taxis or self-driving cars, needs to collect data, label data, train on your network, or train a whole bunch of on your networks, and run those neural networks and cars. And so, you just make your list of how many people are actually building self-driving cars. And every single one of them will need even more GPU accelerated servers. And that\u2019s just for developing the model. The next stage is to simulate the entire software because we know that the industry or the world travels 10 trillion miles per year. And the best we could possibly do is to drive several million normal miles. And what we really want to do is to be able to simulate and stress, stress test our software stack. And the only way to do that is to do in virtual reality. And so, that\u2019s another supercomputer that you have to build for simulating all your software across those billions and billions of virtually created challenging miles. And then lastly, before you OTA, the software, you\u2019re going to have to re-sim and replay against all of the miles that you\u2019ve collected over the years to make sure that you have no regressions before you OTA the new models into a fleet of cars. And so, transportation is going to be a very large industry. Healthcare is the same way, from medical imaging that is now using AI just about everywhere to genomics that has discovered deep learning and the benefits of artificial intelligence, and in the future pathology. The list goes on. And so, industry after industry after industry, we\u2019re discovering the benefits of deep learning, and the industries could be really, really revolutionized by them.\nOperator: Your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: I guess, short-term and a long term. So, for short-term, as you think about your gaming guide, are you embedding any drawdown of channel inventory there? And then, longer term, as you think about Turing Tensor Cores? Can you talk a bit about differentiation versus Volta V100, particularly as you think about 8-bit integer and the opportunities there for inferencing? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: We\u2019re expecting the channel inventory to work itself out. We are masters at managing our channel, and we understand the channel very well. As you know, the way that we go to market is through the channels around the world. We\u2019re not concerned about the channel inventory. As we ramp Turing, whenever we ramp a new architecture, we ramp it from the top down. And so, we have plenty of opportunities as we go back to the back to school in the gaming cycle to manage the inventory. So, we feel pretty good about that. As a result, comparing Volta andTuring, entering, CUDA iscompatible, that\u2019s one of the benefits of CUDA. CUDA, all of the applications that take advantage of CUDA are written on top of cuDNN, which is our network platform to TensorRT that takes advantage -- that takes the output of the frameworks and optimize it for runtime. All of those tools and libraries run on top of Voltaand run on top of Turing and run on top of Pascal. What Turing adds over Pascal is the same Tensor Corethat is inside Volta. Of course, Volta is designed for large scale training. Eight GPUs could be connected together. They have the fastest HBM2 memories. And it\u2019s designed for datacenter applications, has 64-bit double-precision, ECC, high-resilience computing, and all of the software and system software capability and tools that make Voltathe perfect high-performance computing accelerator. In the case of Turing, it\u2019s really designed for three major applications. The first application is to open up Pro Visualization, which is a really large market that has historically used render farms. And we\u2019re really unable to use GPUs until we now have -- we now have the ability to do full path trace, global illumination with very, very large data sets. So, that\u2019s one market that\u2019s brand new as a result of Turing. The second market is to reinvent computer graphics, real time computer graphics for video games and other real time visualization applications. When you see the images created by Turing, you\u2019re going to have a really hard time wanting to see the images of the past. It just looks amazing. And then the third, Turing has a really supercharged Tensor Core. And this Tensor Core is used for image generation. It\u2019s also used for high throughput, deep learning inferencing for data centers. And so, these applications for Turing would suggest that there are multiple SKUs of Turing, which is one of the reasons why we have such a great engineering team, we could scale one architecture across a whole lot of platforms at one time. And so, I hope that answers your question that the Tensor Core inference capability of Turing is going to be off the charts.\nOperator: Next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about cryptocurrency. Now that the dust is settled, you guys have done a good job of kind of laying out exactly how much of the OEM business has been driven by that but there\u2019s also been I think some sense of -- some of the GeForce business was being driven by crypto. Can you -- looking backwards, can you size that for us? And I guess if -- I am trying to understand the impact the crypto would have on the guidance for October, given that it seems it was very small in the July quarter?\nJensen Huang: Well, I think the second question is easier to answer and the reason -- the first one is just ambiguous. It\u2019s hard to predict, anyway. It\u2019s hard to estimate, no matter what. But, the second question, the answer is we\u2019re expecting -- we\u2019re projecting zero basically. And for the first question, how much of GeForce could\u2019ve been used for crypto? A lot of gamers at night, they could -- while they\u2019re sleeping, they could do some mining. And so, do they buy it for mining or did they buy it for gaming, it\u2019s kind of hard to say. And some miners were unable to buy our OEM products, and so they jumped on to the market to buy it from retail, and that probably happened a great deal as well. And that all happened in the last -- the previous several quarters, probably starting from late Q3, Q4, Q1, and very little last quarter, and we\u2019re projecting no crypto-mining going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had one for Jensen and one for Colette. Jensen, I was hoping you could remind us how meaningful your inference business is today within Datacenter, and how would you expect growth to come about over the next two years, as you -- as your success at accounts like Google proliferate across a broader set of customers? And then, for Colette, if you can give directional guidance for each of your platforms. I know you talked about Datacenter a little bit, if you can talk about the other segments. And on gaming specifically, if you can talk about whether or not new products are embedded in that guide?\nJensen Huang: Inference is going to be a very large market for us. It is surely material now in our Datacenter business. It is not the largest segment, but I believe it\u2019s going to be a very large segment of our Datacenter business. There\u2019re 30 million servers around the world, and that\u2019s kind of estimate, in the cloud, and there are a whole lot more in enterprises. I believe that almost every server in the future will be accelerated. And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence and deep learning software and neural net models are going to prediction models, are going to be infused into software everywhere. And acceleration has proven to be the best approach going forward. We\u2019ve been laying the foundations for inferencing for a couple or two, three years. And as we have described at GTCs, inference is really, really complicated. And the reason for that is you have to take the output of these massive, massive networks that are output of the training frameworks and optimize it. This is probably the largest computational graph optimization problem that world has ever seen. And this is brand-new invention territory. There are so many different network architectures from CNNs to RCNNs, to auto encoders to RNNs and LSTMs, there is just so many different species of neural networks these days and is continuing to grow. And so the compiler technology is really, really complicated. And this year, we announced two things. Earlier this year, we announced that we\u2019ve been successful in taking the Tesla P4, low-profile, high-energy-efficiency inference accelerator into hyperscale datacenters. And we announced our fourth generation TensorRT optimizing compiler, neural network optimizing compiler. And TRT 4 goes well beyond CNNs and image recognition in the beginning, and now allows us to support and optimize for voice recognition or speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, translation. And all of these applications are really pervasive from internet services all over the world. And so, now from images to video to voice to recommendation systems, we now have a compiler that can address it. We are actively working with just about every single internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack. And the reason for that is because they need high throughput and very importantly, the need low latency. Voice recognition is only useful if it response in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that. And then, this last week, this week we announced Turing. And I announced that the inference performance of Turing is 10 times the inference performance of Pascal, which is already a couple of hundred times the inference performance of CPUs. And so, you take a look at the rate at which we\u2019re moving on, both in the support of new neural networks, the ever-increasing optimization and performance output of the compilers, and the rate at which we\u2019re advancing our processors, I think we\u2019re raising the bar pretty high. Okay. So, with that, Colette?\nColette Kress: So, when you look at our overall segments, as you\u2019ve even seen our results in terms of this last Q2, there is growth across every single one of our platforms from a year-over-year standpoint. We probably possibly see that again in our Q3 guidance, the year-over-year growth across each and every one of those platforms. Of course, our OEM business will be down likely year-over-year, again just due to absence of those cryptocurrency in our forecast. When we think about sequentially, our hopes is absolutely our Datacenter will grow and will likely see the growth of our Gaming business as well. It\u2019s still early, still we\u2019ve got many different scenarios on our ProViz and Auto. But definitely our Gaming and our Datacenter are expected to grow sequentially.\nOperator: Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis: Two on gross margin. Colette, I just want to make sure I understood July to October gross margins down. I know you\u2019ve been getting a benefit from crypto but it was pretty de minimis in July. So, is there any other than pieces? And then, kind of longer picture here, how do you think about the ramp of Turing affecting gross margins? You\u2019re obviously enabling a lot of capabilities to get paid for it, 12 nanometers, fairly stable. And just kind of curious how to think about over the couple of quarters gross margin with that ramp?\nColette Kress: Yes. So, let me take your first part of the question regarding our gross margins and what we have seen from crypto. Although crypto revenue may not be large, it still has a derivative impact on our stack in terms of what we are selling and to both replenish the overall channel and such. So, over the last several quarters, that we had stabilizing that overall channel, we did get the great effect of selling just about everything and our margins really been able to benefit from that. Again, when we look at the overall growth year-over-year for Q2, you have 500 basis points in terms of growth. We\u2019re excited about what we have now here for Q3 as well, which is also significant growth year-over-year. Of course, we have our high value added platforms as we move forward, both -- those in Datacenter, those in terms of what we expect the effects of Turing in terms of on our Quadro piece as well. But that will take some time for that all to partake. So, we\u2019ll see how that goes. We haven\u2019t announced anything further at this time. But, yes, we\u2019ll see probably over the longer term, the effects of Turing can do.\nOperator: Next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: I\u2019m curious, as we look at the data center business, if you can help us understand the breakdown of demand between hyperscale, the supercomputing piece of the business, and the AI piece. And I guess on top of that, I\u2019m just curious, one of the metrics that\u2019s pretty remarkable over the last couple quarters is you\u2019ve seen significant growth in China. I\u2019m curious, if that\u2019s related to the Datacenter business or what\u2019s really driving that, as kind of a follow-up question. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, Aaron. I think, that if you look at the -- if you start from first principles, here\u2019s the simple way to look at it. Demand is continuing to grow at historical levels of 10x computing demand. Computing demand is increasing at historical levels of 10x every five years. 10x every five years is approximately Moore\u2019s Law. And computing demand continues to grow at 10x every five years. However, Moore\u2019s Law stopped. And so, that gap in the world in high-performance computing, in medical imaging, in life sciences computing, in artificial intelligence, that gap -- because those applications demand more computing capability, that gap can only be served in another way. And NVIDIA\u2019s videos GPU accelerated computing that we pioneered, really stands to benefit from that. And so, at the highest level, whether it\u2019s supercomputing, and this year -- you heard Collette say earlier that NVIDIA GPUs represented 56% of all the new performance that came into the world\u2019s TOP500. The TOP500 is called the TOP500, because it reflects the future of computing. And my expectation is that more and more from one vertical industry after another, and I mentioned transportation, I mentioned healthcare, the vertical industries go on and on, that as computing demand continues at a factor of 10x every five years, developers are rational and logical to have jumped on NVIDIA\u2019s GPU computing to boost their demand. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to answer it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about cloud and hyperscale, we tend to think about the top guys right there, designing their own platforms, using your Tesla-based products or sometimes even designing their own chips for AI and deep learning. But, there\u2019s a larger base of medium to smaller cloud and hyperscale customers out there who don\u2019t have R&D scale. And I think that\u2019s where your HGX platform seems to be focused on. So, Jensen, can you just give us an update on the uptake of your first generation HGX-1 reference platform and the initial interest on HGX-2? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: HGX-1 was I guess kind of the prototype of HGX-2. HGX-2 is doing incredibly well, and for all the reasons that you mentioned. It is an even the largest hyperscale data centers can\u2019t afford to create these really complicated motherboards at the scale that we\u2019re talking about. And so, we created HGX-2, and it was immediately adopted by several most important hyperscalers in the world. And we were at GTC Taiwan, and we announced basically all of the leading server OEMs and ODMs supporting HGX-2 and are ready to take it to market. So, we\u2019re in the process of finishing HGX-2 and ramping into production. And so, I think HGX-2 is a huge success for exactly the reasons that you mentioned. We could use it for essentially a standard motherboard, like the ATX motherboard for PCs that could be used for hyper scalars, it could be used for HPC, it could be used for datacenters, and it\u2019s a really fantastic design. It just allows people to adopt this really complicated and high-performance and really high-speed interconnect motherboard in a really easy way.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS. \nTim Arcuri: Thank you. Actually, I had two questions, Jensen, both for you. First, now that Crypto has fallen off, I\u2019m curious what you think the potential is that maybe we see a slug of cards that get resold on eBay or some other channel and that could cannibalize new Pascal sales. Is that something that keeps you up at night? Number one. And number two, obviously, the stories about Gaming and Datacenter. And I know that you don\u2019t typically talk about customers. But, since Tesla did talk about you on their call, I\u2019m curious what your comments are about the development for Hardware 3 and their own efforts to move away from your DRIVE platform? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Sure. Well, the Crypto mining market is very different today than it was three years ago. And even though, new cards -- at the current prices, it doesn\u2019t make much sense for new cards to be sold into the mining market. The existing capacity is still being used. And you can see the hash rates continue. And so, my sense is that the installed base of miners will continue to use their cards. And then, probably the more important factor though is that that we\u2019re in the process of announcing a brand new way of doing computer graphics. And with Turing and our RTX platform, computer graphics will never be the same. And so, I think there\u2019s -- our new generation of new GPUs is really going to great. I also think that -- I appreciate Elon\u2019s comments about our Company, and I also think Tesla makes great cars, and I drive them very happily. And with respect to the next generation, it is the case that when we first started working on autonomous vehicles, they needed our help. And we used a three-year-old Pascal GPU for the current generation of autopilot computers. And it is very clear now that in order to have a safe autopilot system, we need a lot more computing horsepower. In order to have a safe computing -- in order to have safe driving, the algorithms have to be rich and has to be able to handle corner conditions in a lot of diverse situations. And every time that there\u2019s more and more corner conditions or more subtle things that you have to do or you have to drive more smoothly or be able to take turns more quickly, all of those -- all of those requirements require greater computing capability. And that\u2019s exactly the reason why we built Xavier. Xavier is in production now. We\u2019re seeing great success and customers are super excited about Xavier. And that\u2019s exactly the reason why we\u2019ve built it. And I think a super-hard to build a Xavier and all the software stack on top of it. And if it doesn\u2019t turn out for whatever reasons, it doesn\u2019t turn out for them, they can give me a call, and I\u2019d be more than happy to help.\nOperator: And unfortunately we have run out of time. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: We had a great quarter. Our core platforms exceeded expectations, even as crypto largely disappeared. Each of our platforms AI, Gaming, ProViz and self driving cars continued to enjoy great adoption. These markets are -- we are enabling are some of the most impactful to world -- to the world today. We launched Turing this week. It was 10 years in the making and completes the NVIDIA RTX platform. NVIDIA RTX with Turing is the greatest advance since CUDA, nearly a decade ago. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our Company for tackling this incredible challenge, reinventing the entire graphic stack, and giving the industry a surge of excitement as we reinvent computer graphics. Stay tuned as we unfold the exciting RTX story. See you guys next time.\nOperator: Thank you for joining.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with growth across all our platforms led by gaming and datacenter. Q1 revenue reached a record $3.21 billion, up 66% year-over-year, up 10% sequentially and above our outlook of $2.9 billion. Once again, all measures of profitability set records, with GAAP gross margins at 64.5%, operating margins at 40.4% and net income at $1.24 billion. From a reporting segment perspective, Q1 GPU revenue grew 77% from last year to $2.77 billion. Tegra Processor revenue rose 33% to $442 million. Let's start with our gaming business. Revenue was $1.72 billion, up 68% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially. Demand was strong and broad-based across regions and products. The gaming market remains robust and the popular Battle Royale genre is attracting a new wave of gamers to the GeForce platform. We also continue to see demand from upgrades with about 35% of our installed base currently on our Pascal architecture. The launch of popular titles, like Far Cry 5 and Final Fantasy XV continued to drive excitement in the quarter. Gamers are increasingly engaging in social gameplay and gaming is rapidly becoming a spectator sport, while the production value of games continues to increase. This dynamic is fueling a virtuous cycle that expands the universe of gamers and drives a mix shift to higher end GPUs. At the recent Game Developers Conference, we announced our real-time ray tracing technology, NVIDIA RTX. Ray tracing is movie quality rendering technique that delivers lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows. This has long been considered the holy grail of graphics, and we've been working on it for over 10 years. We look forward to seeing amazing, cinematic games that take advantage of this technology come to the market later this year, with the pipeline building into next year and beyond. And we expect RTX, as well as other new technologies like 4K and virtual reality, to continue driving gamers' requirements for higher GPU performance. While supply was tight earlier in the quarter, the situation is now easing. As a result, we were pleased to see that channel prices for our GPUs are beginning to normalize, allowing gamers who had been priced out of the market last quarter to get their hands on the new GeForce GTX at a reasonable price. Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are included in our OEM business at $289 million. As a result, we could protect the vast majority of our limited gaming GPU supply for use by gamers. Looking into Q2, we expect crypto-specific revenue to be about one-third of its Q1 level. Gaming notebooks also grew well, driven by an increasing number of thin and light notebooks based on our Max-Q design. And Nintendo Switch contributed strongly to year-on-year growth, reflecting that platform's continued success. Moving to datacenter, we had another phenomenal quarter with revenue of $701 million, up 71% year-on-year, up 16% sequentially. Demand was strong in all market segments and customers increasingly embraced our GPUs and CUDA platform for high-performance computing and AI. Adoption of our Volta architecture remained strong across a wide range of verticals and customers. In the public cloud segment, Microsoft Azure announced general availability of Tesla V100 instances joining Amazon, IBM and Oracle. And Google Cloud announced that the V100 is now publicly available in beta. Many other hyperscale and consumer Internet companies also continued their ramp of Volta, which delivers five times the deep learning performance of its predecessor, Pascal. Volta has been chosen by every major cloud provider and server maker, reinforcing our leadership in AI deep learning. In high-performance computing, strength from the broad enterprise vertical more than offset the ramp down of major supercomputing projects such as the U.S. Department of Energy's Summit system. We see a strong pipeline across a number of vertical industries, from manufacturing to oil and gas, which should help sustain the trajectory of high-performance computing next quarter and beyond. Traction is also increasing in AI inference. Inference GPU shipments to cloud service providers more than doubled from last quarter. And our pipeline is growing into next quarter. We dramatically increased our inference capabilities with the announcement of the TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software at our recent GPU Technology Conference in San Jose. TensorRT 4 accelerates deep learning inference up to 190 times faster than CPUs for common applications, such as computer vision, neural machine translation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and recommendation systems. It also dramatically expands the use cases prepared with the prior version. With TensorRT 4, NVIDIA's market reach has expanded to approximately 30 million hyperscale servers worldwide. At GTC, we also announced other major advancements in our deep learning platform. We doubled the memory of Tesla V100 to 32 GB VRAM, which is a key enabler for customers building virtual networks for larger data sets. And we announced a new GPU interconnect fabric called NVIDIA NVSwitch, which joins up to 16 V100 GPUs at a speed of 2.4 terabytes per second or five times faster than the best PCIe switch. We also announced our DGX-2 system, which leverages these new technologies and is updated, fully optimized software stack to deliver a 10x performance boost beyond last year's DGX. DGX-2 is the first single-server capable of delivering 2 petaflops of computational power. We are seeing strong interest from both hyperscale and enterprise customers and we look forward to bringing this technology to cloud customers later this year. At our Investor Day in March, we updated our forecast for the datacenter addressable market. We see the datacenter opportunity as very large, fueled by growing demand for accelerated computing in applications ranging from AI to high performance computing across multiple market segments and vertical industries. We estimate the TAM at $50 billion by 2023, which extends our previous forecast of $30 billion by 2020. We see strong momentum in the adoption of our accelerated computing platform and the expansion of our development ecosystem to serve this rapidly growing market. About 8,500 attendees registered for GTC, up 18% from last year. CUDA downloads have continued to grow, setting a fresh record in the quarter. And our total number of developers is well over 850,000, up 72% from last year. Moving to pro visualization, revenue grew to $251 million, up 22% from a year ago and accelerating from last quarter, driven by demand for real-time rendering, as well as emerging applications like AI and VR. Strength extended across several key industries, including public sector, healthcare and retail. Key wins in the quarter included Columbia University, using high-end Quadro GPUs for AI, and Siemens, using them for CT and ultrasound solutions. At GTC, we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with NVIDIA RTX technology, capable of delivering real-time ray tracing to the more than 25 million artists and designers throughout the world. RTX makes computational intensive ray tracing possible in real time, when running professional design and content creation applications. This allows media and entertainment professionals to see and interact with their creations with correct light and shadows and do complex renders up to 10 times faster than a CPU alone. And the NVIDIA OptiX AI denoiser built into RTX delivers almost 100 times the performance of CPUs for real-time noise-free rendering. This enables customers to replace racks of servers in traditional render farms with GPU servers at one-fifth the cost, one-seventh the space and one-seventh the power. Lastly, automotive. Revenue grew 4% year-on-year to a record $145 million. This reflects the ongoing transition from our infotainment business to our growing autonomous vehicle development and production opportunities around the globe. At GTC and Investor Day, we made key product announcements on the advancement of autonomous vehicles and established a total addressable market opportunity of $60 billion by 2035. We believe that every vehicle will be autonomous one day. By 2035, this will encompass 100 million autonomous passenger vehicles and 10 million robo taxis. We also introduced NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation, a platform that will help car companies, carmakers, Tier 1 suppliers and others developing autonomous vehicle test and validate their systems in a virtual world across a wide range of scenarios before deploying on the road. Each year, 10 trillion miles are driven around the world. Even if test cars can eventually cover millions of miles, that's an insignificant fraction of all the scenarios that require testing to create a safe and reliable autonomous vehicle. DRIVE Constellation addresses this challenge by enabling cars to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality. The platform has two different servers. The first is loaded with GPUs and simulates the environment that the car is driving in, as in a hyper real video game. The second contains the NVIDIA DRIVE Pegasus autonomous vehicle computer, which possesses the simulated data, as if it were coming from the sensors of a car driving on the road. Real-time driving command from the DRIVE Pegasus are fed back to the simulation for true hardware-in-the-loop verification. Constellation will enable autonomous vehicle industry for safety test and validate their AI self-driving systems in ways that are not practical or possible with on-road testing. We also extended our product roadmap to include our next-generation DRIVE autonomous vehicle computer. We have created a scalable AI car platform that spans the entire range of autonomous driving, from traffic jams, pilots, to level 5 robo taxis. More than 370 companies and research institutions are now using NVIDIA's automotive platform. With this growing momentum, we remain excited about the intermediate and long-term opportunities for our autonomous driving business. Now moving to the rest of the P&L, Q1 GAAP gross margins were 64.5% and non-GAAP was 64.7%, records that reflect continued growth in our value added platforms. GAAP operating expenses were $773 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $648 million, up 25% year-on-year. We continue to invest in key platforms driving our long-term growth, including gaming, AI and automotive. GAAP net income was a record $1.24 billion and EPS was $1.98, up 45% (sic) [145%] (15:33) and 151% respectively from a year earlier. Some of the upside was driven by a tax rate of 5% compared to our guidance of 12%. Non-GAAP net income was $1.29 billion and EPS was $2.05, both up 141% from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength as well as gross margins and operating margin expansion and slightly lower tax. Our quarterly cash flow from operations reached record levels at $1.45 billion. Capital expenditures were $118 million. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect revenue to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.6% (sic) [63.3%] (16:26) and 63.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $810 million and $685 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $15 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, I'd like to highlight a few upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the JPMorgan Technology Conference next week on May 15 and at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5. We will also hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders online on May 16. We will now open the call for questions. Simona and I are here in Santa Clara and Jensen is dialing in from the road. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Your first question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I had a question on gaming seasonality. It's usually down pretty decently in Q1. It was obviously flat this time as you were trying to fill up the channel. Now that's done. I was just wondering what the supply demand dynamics as well as like any thoughts on crypto might mean for typical \u2013 the seasonality into Q2 versus what would be typical where it would usually be down \u2013 or usually be up pretty decently. How are you looking at it? And this is a question for Colette.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Jensen, why don't you start on the question for Stacy and I'll follow-up afterwards after you speak.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Okay. Hi Stacy, so let's see. Q1, as you probably know, Fortnite and PUBG are global phenomenons (sic) [phenomena] (18:51). The success of Fortnite and PUBG are just beyond comprehension, really. Those two games are a combination of Hunger Games and Survivor has just captured imaginations of gamers all over the world. And we saw the uptick and we saw the demand on GPUs from all over the world. Surely, there was scarcity as you know. Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter and it drove prices up. And I think that a lot of the gamers weren't able to buy into the new GeForce as a result. And so we're starting to see the prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize. It's still higher than where they should be. And so obviously, the demand is still quite strong out there. But my sense is that there's a fair amount of pent-up demand still. Fortnite is still growing in popularity. PUBG is doing great. And then we've got some amazing titles coming out. And so my sense is that the overall gaming market is just really, is super healthy. And our job is to make sure that we work as hard as we can to get supply out into the marketplace. And hopefully, by doing that, the pricing will normalize and the gamers can buy into their favorite graphics card at a price that we hope they can get it at. And so I think there's a fair \u2013 I mean the simple answer to your question is Fortnite and PUBG. And the demand is just really great. They did a great job.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wonder \u2013 Colette had talked about the inference doubling in sales quarter-over-quarter with cloud. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the early applications for inference? Is that sort of as-a-service business or are you looking at internal cloud workloads? And just any color you can give us on where you guys are sitting in the inference space. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure hi Joe. So as you know, there are 30 million servers around the world. And they were put in place during the time when the world didn't have deep learning. And now with deep learning and with machine learning approaches, the accuracy of prediction, the accuracy of recommendation has jumped so much that just about every Internet service provider in the world that has a lot of different customers and consumers are jumping onto this new software approach. And in order to take this neural network \u2013 and the software that's written by deep learning in these frameworks are massive software. The way to think about these deep neural nets is it has millions and millions and millions of parameters in it and these networks are getting larger every year. And they're enormously complex. And the output of these neural nets have to be optimized for the computing platform that it targets. How you would optimize the neural network for a CPU or a GPU is very, very different. And how you optimize for different neural networks, whether it's image recognition, speech recognition, natural language translation, recommendation systems, all of these networks have different architectures and an optimizing compiler that's necessary to make the neural network run smoothly and fast is incredibly complex. And so that's why we created TensorRT. That's what TensorRT is. TensorRT is an optimizing graph neural network compiler. And it optimizes for each one of our platforms. And even each one of our platforms has very different architectures. For example, we invented recently \u2013 reinvented the GPU and it's called the Tensor Core GPU, and the first of its kind is called Volta. And so TensorRT 4.0 now supports, in addition to image recognition, all of the different types of neural network models. The answer to your question is internal consumption. Internal consumption is going to be the first users. Video recognition, detecting for inappropriate video for example all over the world, making recommendations from the videos that you search or the images that you're uploading. All of these types of applications are going to require enormous amount of computation.\nOperator: Next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and the consistent execution. Jensen, I have two questions about the datacenter, one, from a growth and the second from a competition perspective. So from the growth side, you guys are doing about, say, $3 billion or so annualized but you have outlined a market that could be $50 billion. What needs to happen for the next inflection? Is it something in the market that needs to change? Is it something in the product set that needs to? How do you grow and address that $50 billion market, right, because you have only a few percent penetrated today in that large market. So what needs to change for the next inflection point? And then on the competition side, as you are looking at that big market, how should we think about competition that is coming from some of your cloud customers, like a Google announcing a TPU 3.0 or perhaps others looking at other competing technologies? So any color on both sort of how you look at growth and competition would be very helpful. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks, Vivek. First of all, at its core, this is something we all know now, that CPU scaling has really slowed. And if you think about the several hundred billion dollars worth of computer equipment that's been installed in the cloud, in datacenters all over the world, and as these applications for machine learning and high-performance computing approaches come along, the world needs a solution. CPU scaling has slowed. And so here is the approach that we pioneered a decade and a half ago called GPU computing. And we've been determined to continue to advance it during this time because we saw this day coming and we really believe that it was going to end. I mean, you can't deny physics. And so we find ourselves in a great position today. And as Colette already mentioned, we have something close to 1 million developers on this platform now. It is incredibly fast, speeding up CPUs by 10, 20, 50, 100 times, 200 times sometimes depending on the algorithm. It's everywhere. The software ecosystem is just super rich. And as Colette mentioned, there's already almost 1 million developers around the world that's grown 70% year-over-year. And so I think at the core, it's about the fact that the world needs a computing approach going forward. With respect to our ability to address the TAM, there are three major segments. There's more than that, but there's three major segments. One is of course training for deep learning. The other is inferencing and TRT 4 is intended to do just that to expand our ability to address all of the different types of algorithms, machine learning algorithms that are running in the datacenters. The third is high-performance computing and that's molecular dynamics, to medical imaging, to earth sciences, to energy sciences. The type of algorithms that are being run in supercomputers all over the world is expanding. And we're doing more and more of our product designs in virtual reality. We want to simulate our products and simulate its capabilities in simulation in this computer rather than build it in the beginning. And then the last category would be graphics virtualization. We've taken with GRID and our Quadro Virtual Workstation and now with NVIDIA RTX, we turned the datacenter into a powerful graphics supercomputer. And so these are the various applications and segments of datacenter that we see. I think in the case of training, we're limited by the number of deep learning experts in the world. And that's growing very quickly. The frameworks are making it easier. There's a lot more open source and open documentation on sharing of knowledge. And so the number of AI engineers around the world is growing super fast. The second is inference. And I've already talked about that. It's really limited by our optimizing compilers and how we can target these neural network models to run our processors. And if we could do so, we're going to save our customers enormous amounts of money. We speed up applications. We speed up these neural network models 50 times, 100 times, 200 times over a CPU. And so the more GPUs they buy, the more they're going to save. And high-performance computing, the way to think about that is, I think, at this point, it's very clear that going forward, supercomputers are going to get built with accelerators in them. And because of our long-term dedication to CUDA and our GPUs for acceleration of all these codes and the nurturing of the ecosystem, I think that we're going to do super well in the supercomputing world. And so these are the different verticals. With respect to competition, it all starts with the core. And the core is that the CPU scaling has slowed. And so the world needs another approach going forward. And surely because of our focus on it, we find ourselves in a great position. Google announced TPU 3.0 and it's still behind our Tensor Core GPU. Our Volta is our first generation of a newly reinvented approach of doing GPUs. It's called Tensor Core GPUs. And we're far ahead of the competition and \u2013 but more than that, it's programmable. It's not one function. It's programmable. Not only is it faster, it's also more flexible. And as a result of the flexibility, developers could use it in all kinds of applications, whether it's medical imaging or weather simulations or deep learning or computer graphics. And as a result, our GPUs are available in every cloud and every datacenter, everywhere on the planet and which developers need so that \u2013 accessibility, so that they could develop their software. And so I think that on the one hand, it's too simplistic to compare a TPU to just one of the many features that's in our Tensor Core GPU. But even if you did, we're faster. We support more frameworks. We support all neural networks. And as a result, if you look at GitHub, there are some 60,000 different neural network research papers that are posted that runs on NVIDIA GPUs. And it's just a handful for the second alternative. And so I'd just kind of gave you a sense of the reach and the capabilities of our GPUs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. Jensen, I had a question regarding your decision to pull the plug on your GeForce Partner Program. I think most of us read your blog from last Friday. I think it was, so we understand the basic background. But if you can describe what led to this decision and perhaps talk a little bit about the potential implications, if any, in terms of your ability to compete or gain share. That will be really helpful. Thank you so much.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Toshiya. At the core, the program was about making sure that gamers who buy graphics cards knows exactly the GPU brand that's inside. And the reason for that is because, we want gamers to \u2013 the gaming experience of a graphics card depends so much on the GPU that is chosen. And we felt that using one gaming brand, a graphics card brand, and interchanging the GPU underneath causes it to be less \u2013 causes it to be more opaque and less transparent for gamers to choose the GPU brand that they wanted. And most of the ecosystem loved it. And some of the people really disliked it. And so instead of all that distraction, we're doing so well. And we're going to continue to help the gamers choose the graphics cards, like we always have, and things will sort out. And so we decided to pull the plug because the distraction was unnecessary and we have too much good stuff to go do.\nOperator: Next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nSajal Dogra - Evercore ISI: Hi. This is Sajal Dogra calling in for C.J. Muse. Thank you for taking my question. So I had a question on HPC. TSMC, on their recent call, raised their accelerator attach rate forecast in HPC to 50% from mid-teens. So I would love to get further details on what exactly NVIDIA is doing to software services, et cetera, that's kind of creating this competitive positioning in HPC and AI basically. And then, if I could ask a follow-up basically in benchmarks. So, there's been some news on AI benchmarks whether it's Stanford DAWNBench et cetera. So I would love to get your thoughts on A, the current state of benchmarks for AI workloads and B, your relative positioning of ASICs versus GPUs especially as we move towards newer neural networks like RN and GAN, et cetera. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, thanks for the question. Well, HPC. First of all, at the core, CPU scaling has stalled and it's reached the limits of physics. And the world needs another approach to go forward. We created the GPU computing approach a decade and half ago. And I think at this point, with the number developers jumping on, the number of applications that's emerging, it's really clear that the future of HPC has accelerated. And our GPU approach, because of its flexibility, because of its performance, because of the value that we create that as a result of the throughput of a datacenter, we save people so much money just in cables alone, often times, more than pays for the GPUs that they buy. And the reason for that is because the number of servers reduced dramatically. And so I think the future of HPC is about acceleration and the NVIDIA CUDA GPUs are really in a great position to serve this vacuum that's been created. With respect to benchmarks, you might have seen that earlier this week, we released three speed records: the fastest single GPU, the fastest single computer node, a definition of a computer node is something that fits in a box that runs one operating system, one node; and one instance, one cloud instance. We now have the fastest speed record for one GPU, one node, and one instance. And so we love benchmarks. Nothing is more joyful than having a benchmark to demonstrate your leadership position. And in the world of deep learning, the number of networks is just growing so fast, because the number of different applications that deep learning is able to solve is really huge. And so you need a lot of software capability and the versatility of your platform needs to be great. We also have a lot of expertise in the company in software. I mean, NVIDIA is really a full stack computing company, from architecture, to system software, to algorithms, to applications. We have a great deal of expertise across the entire stack. And so we love these complicated benchmarking \u2013 benchmarks that are out there. And I think this is a great way for us to simplify our leadership position. I think long-term, the number of networks that are going to emerge will continue to grow. And so the flexibility of ASICs is going to be its greatest downfall. And if someone were to create a general-purpose parallel accelerating processor like ours and had it designed to be incredibly good at deep learning, like recently what we did with our Tensor Core GPU, which is a reinvented GPU, and Volta is the first one, it's going to be hard. It's going to be expensive. And we've been doing it a very long time. And so I think this is a \u2013 it's a great time for us.\nOperator: Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, maybe \u2013 I wanted to ask on inference side about edge inference and beyond autos when you look at sizing that TAM, what are the other big areas that you think you can penetrate with GPUs in edge inference besides autos?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, Blayne. The largest inference opportunity for us is actually in the cloud and the datacenter. That's the first great opportunity. And the reason for that is there's just an explosion in the number of different types of neural networks that are available. They're image recognition, there's video sequencing, there's video, there's recommender systems, there's speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding. There are just so many different types of neural networks that are being created. And creating one ASIC that can be adapted to all of these different types of networks is just a real challenge. And by the time that you create such a thing, it's called a Tensor Core GPU, which is what we created. And so I think that the first opportunity for us in large-scale opportunity will be in the datacenter and the cloud. The second will be in vertical markets. The vertical market that you mentioned is self-driving cars. And we see a great opportunity in autonomous vehicles, both in the creation of autonomous vehicles. And I mentioned that before, between now and the time that we ramp our AV computers we call DRIVE, we're going to be selling a whole lot of servers, so that the companies could develop their neural network models for their self-driving cars, as well as simulating in virtual reality their various test drives, as well as testing their neural network and their self-driving car stack against billions and billions of miles of saved up pre-recorded videos. And so in the vertical markets, we're going to see inference both in the datacenter for developing the self-driving car stack as well as in the self-driving cars themselves. Now, in the self-driving cars, the ASPs for Level 2 could be a few hundred dollars to a Level 5 self-driving car, taxi or driverless taxi being a few thousand dollars. And I expect that driverless taxis will start going to market about 2019 and self-driving cars probably somewhere between 2020 and 2021. And I think the size of the market is fairly well modeled. And the simple way to think about that is I believe that every single \u2013 everything that moves someday will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And so the 100 million cars, the countless taxis, all the trucks, all the agriculture equipment, all the pizza delivery vehicles, you name it. Everything is going to be autonomous. And the market opportunity is going to be quite large. And that's the reason why we're so determined to go create that market.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. I actually wanted to go back to the question about seasonality for gaming in June. Normal seasonal sounds like it's up mid-teens for June in gaming. But obviously, the comps are skewed a little bit because of the channel restock and the crypto stuff. So does the guidance for June assume that gaming is better or worse than that mid-teens normal seasonal? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: We're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality, if I understand your question. We're expecting Q2 to be better than Q1. And we're expecting Q2 to be better than seasonality. Did that answer your question?\nOperator: Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. And I'd have a question for Colette. Colette, first thank you for breaking out crypto sales in the OEM line and guide for us. I have a question on your gross margins. Your gross margins have been expanding on product mix, despite component pricing headwinds on the DRAM side. When do you expect component pricing to become a tailwind to your gross margins?\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Thanks so much for the question. When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast generally when those pricing of those components will stabilize. But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that. But I think we have tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. My question is the progress on the deployment of Volta into the cloud service providers. You talked in your prepared remarks about the five deployments, including the Google beta. Can you talk about how soon we can expect to see some of those remaining deployments? And of those already launched, how far are they along? I guess, to say proverbially, what inning are we in, in these deployments?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes. So first of all, Volta is a reinvented GPU. Volta is the world's first GPU that has been designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it the Tensor Core GPU. It still retained all of the flexibilities of all \u2013 everything that CUDA has ever run is backwards compatible, with everything that runs on CUDA. But it has new architectures designed to be incredibly good at deep learning. We call it a Tensor Core GPU. And that's the reason why it has all of the benefits of our GPU but none of the ASICs can catch up to it. And so Volta is really a breakthrough. We're going to be very successful with Volta. Every cloud will have it. The initial deployment is for internal consumption. Volta has been shipping to the cloud providers, the Internet service companies for the vast majority of last quarter, as you guys know. And they're using it internally. And now they're starting to open up Volta for external consumption of their cloud customers. And they are moving as fast as they can. My expectation is that you're going to see a lot more coming online this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork is indicating very positive reception for DGX. And I was wondering, Jensen, if can you help us understand, the high-growth we've seen in the datacenter business, to what extent is that being driven by the DGX. And when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the back half of the year, is this something that kind of layers on top of DGX \u2013 does DGX-2 layer on top of DGX, are they going after different segments and you're kind of segmenting the market with these two different products? Any color on how to think about those two products would be helpful. Thank you\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Hey Colette, could you give me a brief version of that? It was kind of crackling on my side.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: So, I'm going to ask the operator if they could ask for the question again because it was also on our side a little crackly.\nOperator: Yes, Mark your line is open. Please restate your question.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay, thanks. Can you hear me better now?\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, much better, Mark.\nMark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC: Okay, sorry about that, I'm at the airport. So the question was on the DGX family of products. Our own fieldwork indicates a very positive reception. I was wondering Jensen, if you could help us understand the high-growth you've seen in the datacenter market how much is DGX contributing to that. And then when DGX-2 starts to ramp in the second half of the year, how do we think about DGX-1? Does it replace the DGX \u2013 the original DGX, or going after different segments, or do they layer on top of one another? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: I see. Thank you. DGX-2 and DGX-1 will both be in the market at the same time. And DGX is a few hundred million dollar business. It was introduced last year. So its growth rate is obviously very high. It's designed for enterprises where they don't \u2013 they need to have their computers on-premise, but they don't want to build a supercomputer. And they don't have the expertise to do so. And they would like to pull a supercomputer out of a box, plug it in and start doing supercomputing. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises. It's designed for car companies; it's designed for healthcare companies doing life sciences work or medical imaging work. We recently announced a project called Project Clara, which basically takes medical imaging equipment, virtualizes them, containerizes the software and turns it into a \u2013 and most medical imaging equipment today are computational and they \u2013 a lot of them run on NVIDIA CUDA anyways. We can put that into the datacenter, we can virtualize their medical instruments and it gives them the opportunity to upgrade the millions of instruments that are out in the marketplace today. And so DGX is really designed for enterprises and we're seeing great success there. It's really super easy to use and it comes with direct support from HPC and AI researchers at NVIDIA. And the answer to your question at the end is both of them will be in the marketplace at the same time.\nOperator: Next question is from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.\nMitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey guys. I'm actually going to go to a more nitty-gritty question just on the financial side, just to make sure I'm understanding this right. So the OEM beat was pretty material given a lot of crypto revenue. Is it still the case that OEM is materially lower gross margin than your corporate average at this time?\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure, I'll take that question. Generally, our OEM business can be a little bit volatile. Because remember, OEM business incorporates our mainstream GPUs as well as our Tegra integrated. So we have development platforms that we sell on some of the Tegra piece of it. But they are slightly below and I think you can go back and refer to our discussion at Investor Day as there's a slide there that talks about those embedded pieces and them being below. So yes, you're correct. Again, a very small part of our business right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. So your competitor thinks that just 10% of their sales were from crypto or like $150 million, $160 million. And you guys did almost $300 million there. And perhaps I think there could actually be some in gaming as well, which would imply that you guys have two-thirds or more of that market? So I guess what's going on there? Is there a pricing dynamic that's allowing you to have such share there, or do you think it's your competitors that don't know what's actually being sold to miners versus gamers? Why such implied share in that market? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Well, we try to as transparently review our numbers as best we can. Our strategy is to create a SKU that allows the crypto miners to fulfill their needs and we call it CMP. And to be \u2013 as much as possible, fulfill their demand that way. Sometimes, it's just not possible because the demand is too great but we try to do so. And we try to keep the miners on the CMP SKUs as much as we can. And so I'm not exactly sure how other people do it, but that's the way we do it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.\nCraig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations on all the financial records in the quarter. Jensen, I just wanted to come back to an announcement that you made at GTC with ray tracing. Because the technology looked like it was very high fidelity and I think you noted at that time that it was very computationally intensive. So the question is as we think about the gaming business and the potential for ray tracing to enter that platform group, what does it mean for dynamics that we've seen in the past, for example, the ability to really push the high end of the market with high end capability, 1070 Ti launched late last year, it was very successful. Does this give you further flexibility for those types of launches as you bring exciting and very high end technology to market? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah, I appreciate it. NVIDIA RTX is the biggest computer graphics invention in the last 15 years. It took us a decade to do. We literally worked on it continuously for one decade. And to put it into perspective, it's basically film rendering, cinematic rendering except it's in real time. It merges the style of computer graphics, rasterization, and light simulation, what people call ray tracing as well as deep learning and AI, merged it into one unified framework, so that we can achieve cinematic rendering in real time. What it currently takes is a server about a few hours, depending on the scene, it might take as long as a full day, take a few hours to render one frame. So it takes a server, one node of a server, several hours to render one frame. And in order to render 30 frames per second, just imagine the number of servers you need. If you take several hours per frame and you need to render 30 frames per second in order to be real-time, it basically takes a high-performance computer, a supercomputer, a render farm, that's why they call it a render farm, it's a full datacenter designed just for rendering. And now we've created NVIDIA RTX which makes it possible to do in real time. We demonstrated RTX on four Quadro GV100s. It takes four of our latest generation Volta Tensor Core GPUs to be able to render 30 frames per second, the Star Wars cinematic that people enjoyed. And so the amount that we saved, we basically took an entire datacenter and reduced it into one node. And we're now doing it in real time. And so the amount of money that we can save, people who create movies, people who do commercials, people who use film rendering to create the game content, almost every single game is done that way. There's quite a bit of offline rendering to create the imagery and the textures and the lighting. And then there are of course, architectural design and car design, the number of applications, the number of industries that are built on top of modern computer graphics is really quite large. And I'm certain that NVIDIA RTX is going to impact every single one of them. And so that's our starting point, is to dramatically reduce the cost of film rendering, dramatically reduce the time that it takes to do it and hopefully, more GPU servers will be purchased. And of course, better content will be created. Long-term, we've also now plotted the path towards doing it in real time. And someday, we will be able to put RTX into a GeForce gaming card and the transformation to the revolution to the gaming industry will be quite extraordinary. So we're super excited about RTX.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in for my follow-up. This is a question for Colette. I want to follow-up again on the seasonality. Understanding the prior comments, normal seasonal for Q2 for gaming would be up in the double digits. Given your commentary on the crypto declining in Q2, given your commentary on just the general drivers around datacenter and the Volta ramp, I can't bring that together with the idea of gaming being above seasonal within the context of your guidance envelope. So how should I reconcile those things? How are you actually thinking about seasonality for gaming into Q2 within the context of the scenarios that are currently contemplated in your guidance for next quarter?\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Sure, Stacy. Let me see if I can bridge together, Jensen, and then some comments here. Unfortunately, they're moving quite fast to the next question, so I wasn't able to add-on. But let me see if I can add-on here and provide a little bit of clarity in terms of the seasonality. Remember in Q1, we outgrew seasonality significantly. We left Q4 with very low inventory in terms of in the channel. We spent Q1 working on establishing a decent amount of inventory available. We wanted to concentrate on our miners separately. And then you can see we did that in terms of Q1 by moving that to OEM and moving that to cryptocurrency only boards. So we left Q1 at this point with healthy overall channel inventory levels as far as where we stand. So that then takes you now to Q2. But if we overshot in terms of seasonality in terms of Q1, we don't have to do those channel fill dynamics again as we get into Q2. But we do have demand out there for our gamers that we can now address very carefully with the overall inventory that we now have available. So putting together, Q1 and Q2 together, yes, we are within normal seasonality, again, for a guidance. And we'll see how we'll finish in terms of the quarter. But you should be in that range. So, yes, from a normal seasonality, at a year-to-date inclusive of Q2, yes, we're on that overall seasonality. Always keep in mind, generally, our H2s are usually higher than our overall H1s, and that's what you should think about our overall guidance. Gaming is still strong. We have to comment that our overall drivers that have taken us to this place over the last three to five years with phenomenal growth and our ability to grow that overall market is still here and all of those things are together. We just had a few quarters in terms of making sure that we get the overall channel correct and put our miners separately. I hope that clarifies in terms of where we are, in terms of gaming seasonality.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Will Stein with SunTrust.\nWilliam Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my question and squeezing me in. The question relates to the supply chain challenges that you talked so much about in the gaming end market. I'm wondering if there's something particular to that end market that is making the shortages concentrated there, or are in fact other end markets in particular, the datacenter end market, also somewhat restricted from what growth they might have achieved if there weren't the shortages that are out there. And maybe talk about the pace of recovery of those. That'd be really helpful. Thanks so much.\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Let me start off here, and I'll have Jensen finish up on the last part of that question. But overall, our datacenter business did phenomenal. Volta is doing extremely well. And even now with 32-bit, we're seeing tremendous adoption throughout. Again, remember it's very different than the overall consumer business. You have significant amount of time for qualification and that is moving extremely fast, based on a lot of other industries and their ability to qualify. So no, there is not a supply challenge at all in terms of our datacenter. And our overall growth in datacenter, we're extremely pleased with in terms of how the quarter came out. I'll turn it over to you, Jensen, and you can answer the rest of the part of it.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Yeah. The reason why miners love GeForce is because miners are everywhere in the world. One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is that it's not any sovereign currency. And it's in the digital world, it's distributed. And GeForce is the single largest distributed supercomputing infrastructure on the planet. Every gamer has a supercomputer in their PC. And GeForce is so broadly distributed, it's available everywhere. And so GeForce is really a good candidate for any new cryptocurrency or any new cryptography algorithm that comes along. We try the best we can to go directly to the major miners. And they represent the vast majority of the demand. And to the best of our ability, serve their needs directly and we call that C&P (1:02:21) and that's why it's not called GeForce, they're called C&P (1:02:25). And we can serve those miners directly, hopefully to take some of the demand pressure off of the GeForce market. Because ultimately, what we would like is we would like the market for GeForce pricing to come down, so that the gamers could benefit from the GeForces that we built for them. And the gaming demand is strong. I mean, the bottom line is Fortnite is a homerun. The bottom line is PUBG is a homerun. And the number of gamers that are enjoying these games is really astronomic as people know very well. And it's a global phenomenon. These two games are equally fun in Asia as it is in Europe as it is in the United States. And because you team up and this is a Battle Royale, you'd rather play with your friends. So it's incredibly social. It's incredibly sticky. And more and more \u2013 more gamers that play, more of their friends join, and more of their friends join, more gamers that play. And so it's this positive feedback system, and the guys at Epic did a fantastic job creating Fortnite. And it's just a wonderful game genre that people are really enjoying. And so I think at the core of it, gaming is strong and we are looking forward to inventory normalizing in the channel so that pricing could normalize in the channel, so that gamers can come back to buy the GeForce cards that has now been in short supply for over a quarter. And so the pent-up demand is quite significant. And I'm expecting the gamers to be able to buy new GeForces pretty soon.\nOperator: Unfortunately, we ran out of time. I will now turn it back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Let's see here. Is it my turn again?\nColette M. Kress - NVIDIA Corp.: Yes, it is.\nJen-Hsun Huang - NVIDIA Corp.: Okay. We had another great quarter, record revenue, record margins, record earnings, growth across every platform. Datacenter achieved another record with strong demand for Volta and AI inference. Gaming was strong. We are delighted to see prices normalizing and we can better serve pent-up gamer demand. At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI just as traditional computing has slowed. The GPU computing approach that we've pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum. And our invention of the Tensor Core GPU has further enhanced our strong position to power the AI era. I look forward to giving you another update next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, guys, for joining.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 revenue was $3.11 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially, well above our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming businesses. Full year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 7%. We recovered from the excess channel inventory in gaming and an earlier pause in hyperscale spending and exited the year with great momentum. Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.49 billion was up 56% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from our prior year. We enjoyed strong end demand for our desktop and notebook GPUs. Let me give you some more details. Our gaming lineup was exceptionally well positioned for the holidays, with the unique ray tracing capabilities of our RTX GPUs and incredible performance at every price point. From the Singles Day shopping event in China, through the Christmas season in the West, channel demand was strong for our entire stack. Fueling this were new blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, continued esports momentum and new RTX SUPER products. With RTX price points as low as $299, ray tracing is now the sweet spot for PC gamers. Gaming is thriving and gamers prefer GeForce. The global phenomenon of esports keeps gaming momentum with an audience now exceeding 440 million, up over 30% in just two years, according to Newzoo. The League of Legends World Championship brought more than 100 million viewers on par with this month's Super Bowl. Ray tracing titles continue to come to market and GeForce RTX GPUs are the only ones that support this important technology. This quarter Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Deliver Us The Moon were the latest titles to support ray tracing, as well as NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technique, which also uses AI to boost performance. With the proliferation of RTX-enabled games and our best ever top-to-bottom performance, we are solidly into the Turing Architecture upgrade cycle. Gamers continue to move to higher-end GPUs, seeking better performance and support for ray tracing. Gaming laptops posted double-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The category continues to expand, driven by appealing thin and light form factors with fantastic graphics performance. This holiday season retailers stocked a record 125 gaming laptops based on NVIDIA GPUs, up from 94 last year, with our Max-Q designs up 2x. At CES we launched the world's first 14-inch, GeForce RTX laptop with ASUS. We also continue to expand our Studio lineup of laptops for the fast-growing population of freelance creators, designers and Youtubers with 13 new RTX Studio systems introduced at CES. Powered by Turing GPUs, these systems are optimized for over 55 creative and design applications with RTX accelerated ray tracing and/or AI. Last week, we launched our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Powered by GeForce, GeForce NOW is the first cloud gaming service to deliver ray trace games. It's also the only open platform, so gamers can enjoy the games they already have. And use their existing store accounts without having to repurchase games. GeForce NOW enables PC games on Mac, Windows, PCs, TVs, mobile devices and soon Chromebooks. GFN has a freemium business model that includes two membership plans. A free membership with standard access and the Founders tier with a starting price of $4.99 per month which gives priority access and RTX ray tracing support. Our goal with GeForce NOW is to expand GeForce gaming to more gamers. About 80% of GeForce NOW gamers are playing on underpowered PCs or devices with Mac OS or Android. With GeForce NOW, they are able to enjoy PC gaming on a GeForce GPU in the cloud. GeForce Now can expand GeForce well beyond the roughly 200 million gamers we reach today. Separately, we entered into a collaboration with Tencent, the world's largest gaming platform to bring PC gaming in the cloud to China, the world's largest gaming market. NVIDIA GPU technology will power Tencent's Start cloud gaming service, which is in early testing stages. Moving to data center, revenue was a record $968 million, up 43% year-on-year and up 33% sequentially, our strongest ever sequential growth in dollar terms. Full year fiscal year 2020 data center revenue was a record $2.98 billion up, 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale and vertical industry end customers. Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products, in support of key AI workloads such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators. Hyperscale demand was also driven by cloud computing. AWS now makes the T4 available in every region. This underscores the versatility of the T4 which excels at a wide array of high-performance computing workloads, including AI inference, cloud gaming, rendering, and virtual desktop. Vertical industry growth was driven primarily by, consumer Internet companies. Other verticals, such as, retail, health care, and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs, with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements. And we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing, data science and edge computing applications. T4, our inference platform had another strong quarter, with shipments up 4x, year-on-year driven by public cloud deployments, as well as edge AI video analytics applications. T4 and V100, reflecting strong demand for inference and training respectfully, set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue. Even as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training, NVIDIA's inference platform is gaining wide use by some of the world's leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies, including American Express, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA. For example, Microsoft's biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference, of its natural language understanding models. These DNN transformer models, popularized by BERT, have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models. Conversational AI is a major new workload, requiring GPUs for inference to achieve, high throughput within the desired low latency. Indeed, Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide. And just this week, Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2. This advances the state-of-the-art for AI assistance and tasks such as answering questions, summarization and natural language generation. Recommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet powering billions of queries per second. The industry is moving to deep recommendators, such as wide & deep model, which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content. Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs. For example Alibaba's and Baidu's recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitude beyond CPUs. Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10% increase in click-through rates. We also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure. It enables customers for the first time to rent an entire AI supercomputer on demand from their desk, matching the capabilities of large on-premise supercomputers that can take months to deploy. And in Europe, energy company Eni announced the world's fastest industrial supercomputer based on NVIDIA GPUs. AI has even come to pizza delivery. At the National Retail Federations Annual Conference last month, we announced Domino's as a customer deploying our platform for deep learning and data science applications helping with customer engagement and order accuracy prediction. More broadly in retail, we have seen a significant increase in the adoption of NVIDIA's edge computing offerings by large retailers for powering AI applications that reduce shrinkage, optimize logistics and create operational efficiencies. At the SC19 Supercomputing conference, we introduced a reference design platform for GPU-accelerated ARM-based servers along with ecosystem partners, ARM, Ampere computing Fujitsu and Marvell. We made available our ARM-compatible software development kit consisting of NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and development tools for accelerating computing. This opens the floodgate of innovation to support growing new applications from hyperscale cloud to exascale supercomputing. We also introduced NVIDIA Magnum IO, a suite of software optimized to eliminate storage and input/output bottlenecks. Magnum IO delivers up to 20x faster data processing for multi-server, multi-GPU computing nodes when working with massive data sets to carry out complex financial analysis, climate modeling and other workloads for data scientists, high-performance computing and AI researchers. Finally, we introduced TensorRT 7, the seventh generation of our inference software development kit, which speeds up components of conversational AI by 10x comparing to running on CPUs. This helps drive latency below the 300 millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions supporting our growth in conversational AI. Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $331 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially. Full year revenue was a record $1.21 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. ProVis accelerated in Q4 as the rollout of more RTX-enabled applications is driving strong upgrade cycle for our Turing GPUs. RTX is also opening up new market segment opportunities such as rendering and studio for freelance creatives. In November, V-ray Arnold and Blender software renderers began shipping with RTX technology. These joined our leading creative and design applications including Premier Pro, Dimension, SolidWorks, CATIA and Maya. With RTX, these applications enable enhanced creativity and notable productivity gains. In Blender Cycles for example, real-time rendering performance is boosted 4x versus a CPU. RTX is now supported by more than 40 leading creative and design applications reaching a combined user base of over 40 million. Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $163 million, flat from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Full year revenue reached a record $700 million, up 9% year-on-year. During the quarter, we announced DRIVE, AGX Orin, the next-generation platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, powered by our new Orin SoC and delivering nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation Xavier SoC. The platform scales from level two plus AI-assisted driving to level five fully driverless operation. Orin is software-defined and compatible, with Xavier allowing developers to leverage their investment across multiple product generations. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 64.9% and non-GAAP was 65.4%, up sequentially, largely reflecting higher contribution of data center products. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $1.02 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $810 million, up 12% and 7% year-on-year respectively. Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 66% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.89, up 136% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was $1.46 billion. Fiscal year 2020 cash flow from operations was a record $4.76 billion. With that, let me turn the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The outlook does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We are engaged and progressing with China on the regulatory approval and believe the acquisition will likely close in the first part of calendar 2020. Before we get to the new -- the numbers let me comment on the impact of the coronavirus. While it is still early and the ultimate effect is difficult to estimate, we have reduced our Q1 revenue outlook by $100 million to account for the potential impact. We expect revenue to be $3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65% and 65.4% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. Further, financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on the IR website. In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference on March 2nd in San Francisco. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi guys. Thanks very much for the question. I guess on data center Colette or Jensen, can you speak to some of the areas that drove the upside in the quarter? You talked about inference in both the T4 and the V100 having record quarters, but relative to your internal expectations. What were some of the businesses that drove the upside and if you can also speak to the breadth of your customer profile today relative to a couple of years ago, how that's expanded. That would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Toshiya thanks a lot for your question. The primary driver for our growth is AI. There are four fundamental dynamics. The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs in fact in natural language understanding, in conversational AI and recommendation systems. And you know this, but for the others in the audience, recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today. And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world, whether it's a store or whether it's content or websites or information you are querying, there are hundreds of billions, trillions and depending on how you count it hundreds of trillions of items in the world. And there are billions of people each with their own characteristics and there are countless contexts. And between the items the people the users and the various contexts that we're in location and what you're looking for and weather or what's happening in the environment, those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you. The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search in the beginning and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time over the last year, it's been able to be done in deep learning. And so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI which means that whereas, we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the model is getting larger and there are more of them we're seeing a lot of these models going into production and that business is called inference. Inference as Colette mentioned, grew 4 times year-over-year. It's a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don't understand about Inference is, it's an incredibly complex computational problem, but it's an enormously complex software problem. And so, the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called Inference. The third is the growth not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud. And the OpEx model works much better for them as they're younger. When they become larger they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud. We're also seeing really great success in verticals. One of the most exciting vertical is logistics, logistics, retail, warehousing. We announced I think this quarter or last -- end of last quarter USPS, American Express, Walmart just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they're trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on. And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries. And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot and this is really, really exciting and it's called Edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is. But the industries now calls Edge AI. We're seeing a lot of excitement there. And the reason for that is, you need to have low latency, inference. You might not be able to stream data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons and you need the response time. And so those four dynamics around AI really drove our growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Just following up on that. As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business now that you have the perspective of seeing what's driving the rebound any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us what happened there? And I guess as it pertains to the future do we think of this as a business that will have that kind of lumpiness to it?\nJensen Huang: Yes. That's a really good question. In fact if you look backwards now we have the benefit of history. The deep recommendation systems, the natural language understanding breakthroughs, the conversational AI breakthroughs, all happened in this last year. And the velocity by which the industry captured the benefits here and continue to evolve and advance from these what so-called transformer models was really quite incredible. And so the all of a sudden the number of breakthroughs in AI has just grown tremendously and these models have grown tremendously. Just this last week Microsoft announced that they've trained a neural net model in collaboration with the work that we did we call Megatron, increased the size's of the model from 7.5 billion parameters to 17.5 billion parameters. And the accuracy of their natural language understanding has just -- has really been boosted. And so the models are -- AI is finding really fantastic breakthroughs and models are getting bigger and there are more of them. And when you look back and look at when these breakthroughs happened it essentially happened this last year. The second, we've been working on inference for some time. And until this last year very few of those inference models went into production. And now we have deep learning models across all of the hyperscalers in production. And this last year we saw really great growth in inference. The third dynamic is public clouds. All these AI startups that are being started all over the world there's about 6,000 of them, they're starting to develop and be able to put their models into production. And with the scale out of AWS we now have T4s in every single geography. So the combination of the availability of our GPUs in the cloud and the startups and vertical industries deploying their AI models into production the combination of all that just kind of came together. And all of that happened this last year. And as a result we had record sales of V100s and T4s. And so we're quite excited with the developments and it's all really powered by AI.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on returning the business back to the strong growth. Jensen, I wanted to ask about how you are positioned from a supply perspective for this coming year? Your main foundry is running pretty tight. How will you be able to support the 20% or so growth here that many investors are looking for? If you could just give us some commentary on how you're positioned from a supply perspective that will be very helpful.\nJensen Huang: Well I think we're in pretty good shape on supply. We surely won't have ample supply. It is true that the industry is tight and the combination of supporting multiple processes, multiple fabs across our partner TSMC. We've got a lot of different factories and a lot of different -- several different nodes of process qualified. I think we're in good shape. And so we just have to watch it closely. And we're working very closely with all of our customers and forecasting. And of course that gives us better visibility as well and -- but all of us have to do a better job forecasting and we're working very closely between our customers and our foundry partner TSMC.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks. Colette, I'm wondering if you can give us -- in data center if you can give us a little idea of what the mix was between industries and hyperscale? I think last quarter hyperscale was a little bit less than 50%. Can you give us maybe the mix or how much it was up something like that? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yes. Tim thanks for the question. Similar to what we had seen last quarter with all things growing as we moved into this quarter growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries and even in the cloud instances, we're still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. When I look at the numbers the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost 2x or north of 2x what we've seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter. I'm just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework. And Jensen just curious I mean as you think about the bigger picture where do you think we stand from an industry perspective today in terms of the amount or the attach rate of GPUs is for acceleration in the server market? And where do you think that might be looking out over the next three years or so? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks Aaron. Colette do you want to go first?\nColette Kress: Sure. When we think about going into Q1 and our data center overall growth, we do expect to see continued growth both going into Q1. We believe our visibility still remain positive quite well and we're expecting that as we move into it and go forward.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Aaron I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday. And at the very core of it most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it. Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries. Whether it's shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question, the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down. And that filtering process is called recommendation. That recommendation system is really complex and deep learning is going to be involved in all that. That's the first thing. I believe that every query will be accelerated. The second is as you know CPU scaling has really slowed and there's just no two ways about it. It's not a marketing thing. It's a physics thing. And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended. And it's called the end of Dennard scaling. And so there has to be another approach. The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that's necessary to for every single query, but the benefit that comes along with that and the end of Dennard scaling suggests that there needs to be another approach and we believe that approach is acceleration. Now, our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator. Notice we never say accelerator, we say accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs. The AIs will continue to evolve the models will continue to evolve and get larger and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable. It is one of the reasons why we've been so successful. And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last three or four years around this area the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models, and the advances that these models are creating. And so we're seeing the beginning of a new computing era. A fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It's going to require an accelerated computing platform and software richness is really vital so that these data centers could be software defined. And so I think that we're in the early innings, the early innings, very, very early innings of this new future. And I think that accelerated computing is going to become more and more important.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon and obviously congratulations on the data center success. I wanted to ask a little bit Colette about the -- you took $100 million out for coronavirus, and I wanted to ask a little bit about how you got to that number. Really two pieces. One, if you could remind us, maybe in terms of units or revenue how -- what percentage of your gaming business is within China? And as you look at that $100 million that you put out of the guidance, are you thinking about that from a demand disruption perspective? Or are you thinking about it from something in the supply chain that might limit your sales? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question Matt. So, it's really still quite early in terms of trying to figure out what the impact from the overall coronavirus maybe. So, we're not necessarily precise in terms of our estimate. Yes, our estimates are split between an impact possibly on gaming and data center, and split pretty much equally. The $100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or maybe overall demand. But we're still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be. In terms of our business and our business makeup, yes, our overall China business for gaming is an important piece. We have about 30% of our overall China gaming as a percentage of our overall gaming business. For data center, it moves quite a bit. They are a very important market for us, but it moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on the overall end customer mix as well as the system builders that they may choose. So, it's a little harder to determine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and guidance. On gaming -- yeah, no problem. Good to see the recent launch of your GeForce NOW service. But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world, so they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place. But how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership? Is it going to be deal your GeForce NOW hardware framework? Or will you just be supporting them with your standalone GPU products? And when do you expect the service to go mainstream?\nJensen Huang: Let's see. Tencent is the world's largest publisher. China represents about a third of the world's gaming and transitioning to the cloud is going to be a long-term journey. And the reason for that is because Internet connection is not consistent throughout the entire market. And a lot of application still needs to be onboarded and we're working very closely with them. We're super enthusiastic about it. If we're successful long term, we're talking about an extra one billion gamers that we might be able to reach. And so, I think that this is an exciting opportunity just the long-term journey. Now here in the West, we've had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the beta centers, the local hubs as well as people's WiFi routers at home. And so, we've been in data for quite some time as you know. And here at West our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now, and we're in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We're the only cloud platform that's based on Windows, and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud. And so the reach is -- we've had more experience here in the West with reach and we've had -- we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I'm super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent. Overall, our GeForce NOW, you guys saw the launch, the reception has been fantastic. The reviews have been fantastic. Our strategy has three components. There's the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don't have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I'm excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example like Tencent. And we offer them our platform of course and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the gaming side. If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you're looking for typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April. And I guess can you speak to that? And then how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with recreation content becoming more available? How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then just really as a modeling question as part of gaming. With notebook now is third of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. So C.J., I want to go first and then Colette is going take it home here. So the first part of it is this, our gaming business has at the end -- I'm sorry. Okay. Our gaming business the end market demand is really terrific. It's really healthy. It's been healthy throughout the whole year. And it's pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic. And it's very -- it's super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have 30 -- over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting. The second factor -- and one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it's now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world. The second part of our business that is changing in gaming is the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business as Colette mentioned earlier, has seen double-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it's a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device. And so the fact that we've been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook, a thin and light notebook is really a breakthrough. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing such great success in notebook. Between the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It's more seasonal, because devices systems like notebooks and Switch are built largely in two quarters Q2 and Q3. And they build largely in Q2 and Q3, because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season. And so that's one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks. I'm going to hand it over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Yeah. So with that from a background and you think about all those different components that are within gaming the notebook, the overall Switch and of course all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop, our normal seasonality as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those three pieces is usually sequentially down from Q4 sequentially down Q4 to Q1. This year the outlook assumes it will probably be a little bit more pronounced due to the coronavirus. So, in total, we're probably looking at Q1 to be in the low double-digit sequential decline in gaming.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And good job on results and guide. On the same topic coronavirus. Colette, I'm a bit surprised that the guidance -- the range on the guidance is not wider versus historic. Can you just talk about why not widen the range? And what went into that $100 million hit from the coronavirus?\nColette Kress: So Atif, thanks for the question. Again, it's still very early regarding the coronavirus. Our thoughts are out with both the employees the families and others that are in China. So our discussions both with our supply chain that is very prominent in the overall Asia region, as well as our overall AIC makers, as well as our customers is as about as timely as we can be. And that went into our discussion and our thoughts on the overall guidance that we gave into our $100 million. We'll just have to see how the quarter comes through and we'll discuss more when we get to it. But at this time that was our best estimate at this time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I'd love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically NVIDIA's had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that's changed where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think is what it's called at the endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth?\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Will. Let's see I think the -- historically inference has been a small part of our business because AI was still being developed. Deep learning AI is not -- historical AI, classical machine learning weren't particularly suited for GPUs and weren't particularly suited for acceleration. It wasn't until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary. And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed. Eventually the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems these require instantaneous response. The faster the answer, the more likely someone is going to click on the answer. And so you know that latency matters a great deal and it's measurable. The effect on the business is directly measurable. And so for conversational AI, for example, we've been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to -- for example fix the errors and such come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis. That entire pipeline could take several seconds. We run it so fast that it's possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of 100 to 300 milliseconds. That is in the realm of interactive conversation. Beyond that it's just simply too slow. And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference moving to production. And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential now moving forward, I think you're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference. The way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way. And the way that AI has evolved and deep learning, it suggests that acceleration on GPUs is just a really phenomenal approach. Data centers are going to have to be software-defined. And I think as I mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier to another question, I believe that in the future the data center will all be accelerated. It will be all running AI models and it will be software defined and will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential. As you move out to the edge, it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined whether it has to be programmable or whether it's fix functioned. There are many, many devices where the inference work is very specific. It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion. Those type of inference models are \u2013 could still be based on deep learning. It's function-specific. You don't have to change it very often, and you're running one or two models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective. I believe those AI chips, you're going to have AI chips that are $0.50, $1 and you're just going to put it into something and it's going to be doing magical detections. The type of platforms that we're in, such as self-driving cars and robotics, the software is so complicated and there's so much evolution to come yet and it's going to constantly get better. Those software-defined platforms are really the ideal targets for us. And so we call it AI at the edge, edge computing devices. One of the edge computing devices, I'm very excited about is, what people call mobile edge or basically 5G telco edge. That data center will be programmable. We recently announced that we partnered with Ericsson and we're going to be accelerating the 5G stack. And so that needs to be a software-defined data center. It runs all kinds of applications, including 5G. And those applications are going to be \u2013 those opportunities are fantastic for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, I guess, I had a question about your \u2013 how you think about the sustainability of your market position in the data center. And I guess in my simplistic view about 12 years ago you made out a consensus call to invest in CUDA software distribute it to universities. Neural networking took off and you were the de facto standard and here we are right now. And for me what's interesting to hear is that the demand that you're seeing today for your products is from markets that's just developed within the last year. And my question is like, how do you think about your investment your R&D investment strategy to make sure that you are staying way ahead of the market of the competition and even your customers who are investing in these markets too? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Our company has to live 10 years ahead of the market. And so we have to imagine where the world is going to be in 10 years time, in five years time and work our way backwards. Now, our company is focused on one singular thing. The simplicity of it is incredible. And that one singular thing is accelerated computing. Accelerated computing and accelerated computing is all about the architecture of course. It's about the complicated systems that we're in, because throughput is high. When our acceleration we can \u2013 when we can compute 10, 20, 50, 100 times faster than the CPU, all of a sudden everything becomes a bottleneck. Memory's a bottleneck, networking's a bottleneck, storage is a bottleneck, everything is a bottleneck. And so we have to be \u2013 NVIDIA has to be a supremely good system designer. But the complexity of our stack which is the software stack above it is really where the investments over the course of the last \u2013 some 29 years now has really paid off. NVIDIA frankly has been an accelerated computing company since the day it was born. And so we \u2013 our company is constantly trying to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate. Of course, computer graphics was an original one and we're reinventing it with real-time ray tracing. We have rendering, which is a brand-new application that we're making great progress in. We just talked \u2013 I just mentioned 5G acceleration. Recently, we announced genomics computing. And so those are new applications that are really important to the future of computing. In the area of artificial intelligence, from image recognition to natural language understanding, to conversation, to recommendation systems, to robotics and animation, the number of applications that we're going to accelerate in the field of AI is really, really broad. And each one of them are making tremendous progress and getting more and more complex. And so the question about the sustainability of our company really comes down to two dimensions. Let's assume for the fact \u2013 let's assume for now that `accelerated computing is the path forward and we surely believe so. And there's a lot of evidence from the laws of physics to the laws of computer science that would suggest that accelerated computing is the right path forward. But this really basically comes down to two dimensions. One dimension is, are we continuing to expand? Are we continuing to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate? Whether it's AI or computer graphics or genomics or 5G for example. And then the number -- and then the second is those applications, are they getting more impactful and adopted by the ecosystem, the industry? And are they continuing to be more complex? Those dimensions, the number of applications and the impact of those applications and the evolution the growth of complexity of those applications, if those dynamics continue to grow, then I think we're going to do a good job. We're going to sustain. And so -- and I think when I spelled it out that way, it's basically the equation of growth of our company. I think it's fairly clear that the opportunities are fairly exciting ahead.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for squeezing me in. Jensen, I just wanted to ask you on the auto side. I think at least one of your customers might have slowed out their program. Just kind of curious as you look out the next couple of years, the challenges if the OEM is moving slower? And then just any perspective on the regulatory side has anything changed there would be helpful? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: I think that the automotive industry is struggling, but for all of the reasons that everybody knows. However, the enthusiasm to redefine and reinvent their business model has never been greater. Every single one of them, every single one of them would know now and they surely -- they've known for some time and autonomous capabilities is really the vehicle to do that. They need to be tech companies. Every car company wants to be a tech company. They need to be a tech company. Every car company needs to be software-defined. And the platform by which to do so is an electric vehicle with autonomous autopilot capability. That car has to be software-defined. And this is their future and they're racing to get there. And so although the automotive industry is struggling in near term, their opportunity has never been better in my opinion. The future of AV is more important than ever. The opportunity is very real. The benefits of autonomous is for whether it's safety, whether it's utility, whether it's cost reduction and productivity has never been more clear. And so, I think that I'm as enthusiastic as ever about the autonomous vehicles and the projects that we're working on are moving ahead. And so the near-term challenges of the automotive industry or whatever sales slowdown in China that they're experiencing, I feel badly about that. But the industry is as clearheaded about the importance of AV as ever.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: We had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics and the market's response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming. Our data center business is enjoying a new wave of growth powered by three key trends in AI natural language understanding, conversational AI, deep recommenders are changing the way people interact with the Internet. The public cloud demand for AI is growing rapidly. And as AI shifts from development to production, our inference business is gaining momentum. We'll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month's GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won't be disappointed. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, two dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on the heels of CONTROL, an action adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week's PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement. RTX GPUs now drive more than 2/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue. Gaming laptops were a standout, driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth. This holiday season, our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers, students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market. This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology, triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year. In late October, we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super, which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance, faster memory and new features. The 1660 Super delivers 50% more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060, the best-selling gaming GPU of all time. It began shipping on October 29, priced at just $229. PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming. We also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models, Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which launched on October 28. These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks. Shield TV has been widely recognized as the best streamer on the market. Finally, we made progress in building out our cloud gaming business. Two global service providers, Taiwan Mobile and Russia's Rostelecom with GFN.ru joined SoftBank and Korea's LG as partners for our GeForce NOW game-streaming service. Additionally, Telef\u00f3nica will kick off a cloud gaming proof-of-concept in Spain. Moving to data center. Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google's breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past. Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here. Second, real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition, language understanding, text-to-speech and voice encoding. While conventional approaches fail at these tasks, NVIDIA's GPUs can handle the entire inference chain, in less than 30 milliseconds. This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration. Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference. In addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity, our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds. In September, Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally, following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year. We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs, and both were records. Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue. Last week, the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference, MLPerf inference, were announced. We won. In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications, NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks. This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads, which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us. Several product announcements this quarter helped extend our AI computing platform into new markets, the enterprise edge. At Mobile World Congress, Los Angeles, we announced a software-defined 5G wireless RAN solution accelerated by GPUs in collaboration with Ericsson. This opens up the wireless RAN market to NVIDIA GPUs. It enables new AI applications as well as AR, VR and gaming to be more accessible to the telco edge. We announced the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. With an ecosystem of more than 100 technology companies worldwide, early adopters include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, NTT East and the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas. Additionally, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing. This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure. Finally, last week, we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers, CIOs and federal employees. At the event, we announced that the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest delivery service with almost 150 billion pieces of mail delivered annually, is adopting AI technology from NVIDIA, enabling 10x faster processing of package data and with higher accuracy. Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $324 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 11% sequentially driven primarily by mobile workstations. NVIDIA RTX graphic and Max-Q technology have enabled a new wave of mobile workstations that are powerful enough for design applications yet thin and light enough to carry. We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities. Over 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs. Just last week, at the Adobe Max Conference, RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps. RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers, driving demand for our RTX GPUs. We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science, AI and VR applications. Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing, public sector, higher education and health care customers. Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $162 million, down 6% from a year ago and down 22% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2. Additionally, we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness. Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In August, Optimus Ride launched New York City's first autonomous driving pilot program powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. Urban settings pose unique challenges for autonomous vehicles given the number of density of objects that need to be perceived and comprehended in real time. Our DRIVE computer and software stack allows these shuttles to safely and effectively provide first- and last-mile transit services. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in auto. Our offering is -- consists of in-car AV computing platforms as well as GPU servers for all AI development and simulation. We believe we are well positioned in the industry with leading end-to-end platform that enables customers to develop, test and safely operate autonomous vehicles, ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robo-taxis. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 63.6%, and non-GAAP was 64.1%, up sequentially, reflecting a benefit from sales of previously written-off inventory, higher GeForce GPUs average selling prices and lower component costs. GAAP operating expenses were $989 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $774 million, up 15% and 6% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $1.45, down 26% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78, down 3% from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We expect revenue to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects expectations for strong sequential growth in data center, offset by a seasonal decline in notebook GPUs for gaming and Switch-related revenue. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 64.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.02 billion and $805 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3, Deutsche Bank's Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya: For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot, Vivek. We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers. As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all -- most -- that is really driven by several factors. The -- as you know, we've been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn't really take that much of the data center capacity. Over the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you're watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections, all of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you're going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning. The second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time. And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we're seeing people do is -- the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and they're getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers. The second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there's a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor, there's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don't have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot. And then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn't own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can't afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this -- so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA's full stack of every single model. And it's managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can't afford to go out there to manage them. And we've seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service. And so those are -- I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it's nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there's like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1/3 of the world's land mass. And so there's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX.\nVivek Arya: Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you're probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October -- into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out?\nJensen Huang: Yes. During Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we're seeing -- what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming -- and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it's so important. I would say that at this point, I think it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects -- the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them. Second, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand-new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I'm excited about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: I have a follow-up if I can as well. Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you had the benefit of selling through some written-off components. So I guess first question is what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter. And how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter? What should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend? And again, I have a quick follow-up.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question. In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time. Over the long term, we do expect gross margins to improve, and we'll continue to see, outside of the benefit that we received, gross margin improvement for the long term.\nJensen Huang: Yes. As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA's really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU -- having the world's best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it's in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can't just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we're a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers. And as a platform company that has a great deal of software intensity, it's natural that the margins would be higher over time.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Very helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen hyperscale -- your hyperscale business within data center grow both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis in this last print. You also mentioned that your visibility is improving. Can you just help us understand what exactly you're seeing in the hyperscale guys because it feels like there's some mixed data points out there? What underpins your improved visibility? Or what are you seeing in that piece of your business?\nJensen Huang: Yes. We had a strong Q3. We're going to see a much stronger Q4. And the foundation of that is AI, it's deep learning inference. That is -- this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train. I mentioned earlier about conversational AI. Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why -- although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated -- we submitted all 5 results -- all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it's really quite a great challenge. And it's one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn't been solved, and we've been working hard at it for the last 6, 7 years now. And so this is really the great opportunity. We've been talking about inference for some time now. Finally, the workloads and a very large diverse set of workloads are now moving into production. And so I'm hoping -- I'm enthusiastic about the progress and seeing the trends and the visibility that inference should be a large market opportunity for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nChristopher Muse: I guess I'd love to follow on, on that last question. So clearly, your commentary, Jensen, here is much more bullish than I've heard you, I think, before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so I guess can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12, 24 months as you see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise, considering, I would think, inference over time could be -- could grow into a large opportunity there as well?\nJensen Huang: Yes. C.J., that's really good. Let me break it down. So when we think about hyperscale, there are three parts: training, inference and public cloud. Training, you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they've been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think what we're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing, training. The second part is an untapped market for us, and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They're very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I've talked about this before, but I've never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only -- the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the -- our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global. We're working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems, conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really, really interesting problems. Now the cloud is the third piece. And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups. And these start-ups, of course, use cloud service providers so that they don't have to invest in their own infrastructure because it's fairly complicated. And so we're seeing a lot of growth there. And so that's just the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth -- 3 areas of growth: training, inference and public cloud. And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups. Then there's the intelligent edge, which we recently ventured into, and we've been building this platform called EGX for some time. And it's cloud native. It's incredibly secure. You can manage it from afar. It's -- the stack is complicated. It's performant. And we saw some -- we've been working with some early adopters. And this last quarter, we announced some of them: Walmart and BMW and Procter & Gamble and the largest logistics company in the world, USPS. And so this new platform, I think, long term, will likely be the largest opportunity. And the reason for that is because of the industries that it serves.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: There are a lot of concerns around China trade tensions, economic slowdown. But history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends and, in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography?\nJensen Huang: Gaming is solid in China, and it is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn't get the technology in there so that it's both delightful to own as well as powerful to enjoy. And so we saw really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China, and RTX adoption has been fast. Your comments make sense because most of the games are free-to-play these days. The primary games that people play are esports, which you want the best gear, but you could -- after you buy the gear, you pretty much enjoy it forever; and mobile, which is largely free-to-play. You invest in some of your own personal outfits. And after that, I think you can enjoy it for quite a long time. And so the gear is really important. One of the areas where we've done really great work, particularly in China, has to do with social. We have this platform called GeForCe Experience. And as an extension of that, there's a new feature called RTX Broadcast Engine. And it basically applies AI to broadcasting your content to share it. You could make movies. You could capture your favorite scenes and turn it into art, applying AI. And one of the coolest features is that you could overlay yourself on top of the game and share it with all the social networks without a green screen behind you. We use AI to stitch you out, basically, to cut you out of the background and irrespective of what noisy background you've got. And so as you know, China has really a super hyper social community -- communities back there and they have all kinds of really cool social platforms to share games and user-generated content and short videos and all kinds of things like that. And so GeForce has that one additional feature that really makes it successful.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I wanted to ask on automotive. Colette, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your legacy infotainment business being down in the quarter. Just curious, what percentage of automotive revenue at this point is legacy infotainment versus the newer AI/ADAS solutions? And more importantly, Jensen, if you can speak to the growth trajectory in automotive over the next 1.5 years, maybe 2, that would be appreciated. And I do ask the question because it feels like we've heard many, many announcements, customer announcements, collaborative work that you're doing with your customers, yet we haven't quite seen sort of a hockey-stick inflection that some of us were expecting a couple of years ago. So just kind of curious when we should -- how we should set our expectations going forward.\nColette Kress: Yes. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems for our automotive business. It is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well, both sequentially as well as year-over-year, as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing, including development services.\nJensen Huang: Let's see. The -- we're the first -- probably the first AV car that's going to be passenger-owned on the road, and I think we've talked about it before, is Volvo. And we're expecting them to be in the late 2020, early 2021 time frame. And I'm still expecting so. And then there's the 2022, 2023 generations. Most -- I would say most of the passenger-owned vehicle developments are going quite well. The industry, as you know, is under some amount of pressure, and so a lot of them have slipped it out a couple of years or so. And this is something that I think we've already spoken about in the past. Our focus, our strategy consists of several areas. One area, of course, is passenger-owned vehicles. The second part is robot taxis. We have developments going with just about every major robot taxi company that we know of. And they're here in the states. They're in Europe. They're in China. And when you hear news of them, we're delighted to see their progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don't carry people, they carry goods. And so we have a major development with Volvo. That was Volvo Trucks. Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are 2 different companies. One of them belongs to Geely, Volvo Cars. Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods. You also see us during various GTCs, I'll mention companies that we're working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You're going to see a whole bunch of things like that because the technology is very similar, and it's starting to -- the development -- the technology we develop for passenger-owned vehicles has started to propagate down into logistics vehicles. I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that, I think, is, at this point, fairly certain. Now our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system, and it's software-defined, it's scalable, as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody's working on AV and they're using AI, and most of them are, there's a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up and they're collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us. And so I'm anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV. And they will be. They will be. This is a foregone conclusion.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Rasgon: I have two data center questions for Colette. The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you're calling it out in Q4 and you didn't call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4?\nColette Kress: Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.\nStacy Rasgon: So I guess to ask the question again, would you define what you saw in Q3 as being strong growth as well?\nColette Kress: I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4, we'll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy.\nStacy Rasgon: Okay. And for my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year. Now -- and that's after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me -- I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what's going on there? What drove that? And what should we expect going forward?\nColette Kress: Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC.\nMitchell Steves: I apologize for any background noise, but I just have one question, just for Jensen. So in 2018, can you give us a rough update on what the GPU utilization was for deep learning application? What it is today? I'm just wondering how the -- how that's advanced over the last couple of year or two.\nJensen Huang: Let's see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now -- we have now sold more -- this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that's used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They're at record levels. And T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago, now it's selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think that's really the major difference that inference is really kicking into gear, and my sense is that it's going to continue to grow quite nicely.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there -- how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU?\nJensen Huang: Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it's really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that's necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it's a VM environment like VMware. And we -- recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner -- we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they're seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we're going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes. And so our strategy is to -- our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we're going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we've done for creating a -- excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software -- run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center. The power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can't do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center's computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they're geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that's really -- this is really the future that we're going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT -- AI and IoT applications\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray.\nHarsh Kumar: I apologize for the background noise. But Colette, maybe you could give us an idea of gaming. In the guidance, it's down. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there?\nColette Kress: I would say, for our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need. So we will have to see how the quarter ends on that. But in both cases, in totality, these businesses have ranged, maybe in totality of the 2, of about $500 million a quarter. And we'll see both of them sequentially decline. Thank you.\nOperator: I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by strong gaming growth and hyperscale demand. We're making great strides in 3 big impact initiatives. The world of computer graphics is moving to ray tracing, and our business reflects that. Some of the biggest blockbuster games this holiday season and beyond are RTX-enabled, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and the best-selling game of all-time, Minecraft. Design applications used by millions of artists and creators are rapidly adopting RTX ray tracing. We're reinventing computer graphics and look forward to upgrading the hundreds of millions of PC gamers to RTX. Hyperscale demand was strong this quarter, and our visibility continues to improve. The race is on for conversational AI, which will be a powerful catalyst for us in both training and inference. And lastly, we have extended our computing platform beyond the cloud to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT, will revolutionize the world's largest industries. We look forward to updating you on our progress in February.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

My name is Christina, and I will be your conference operator today. Welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Simona Jankowski from Investor Relations to begin your conference.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to NVIDIA\u2019s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA\u2019s Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The content of today\u2019s call is NVIDIA\u2019s property. It can\u2019t be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.

All our statements are made as of today, August 15, 2019, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q2 revenue was $2.58 billion, in line with our outlook, down 17% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.31 billion was down 27% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially. We are pleased with the strong sequential growth in the quarter when we launched our RTX SUPER lineup for desktop gamers, wrapped up our greatest ever number of gaming laptops and launched our new RTX studio laptops for creators. In July, we unveiled 3 GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs, delivering the best-in-class gaming performance and power efficiency and real-time ray tracing for both current and next-generation games. These GPUs delivered a performance boost of up to 24% from our initial Turing GPUs launched a year earlier. The SUPER lineup strengthens our leadership in the high end of the market and the response has been great. We look forward to delighting gamers with the best performance in ray tracing as we get into the back to school and holiday shopping seasons. Ray tracing is taking the gaming industry by storm and have quickly come to define the modern era of computer graphics. A growing number of blockbuster AAA titles have announced support for NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Cyberpunk 2077, Watch Dogs: Legion and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. Excitement around these titles is tremendous. GameSpot called Cyberpunk one of the most anticipated games of the decade. NVIDIA GeForce RTX are the only graphic cards in the market with hardware support for ray tracing. They deliver a 2 to 3x performance speed up over GPUs without a dedicated ray tracing core. The laptop business continues to be a standout growth driver as OEMs are ramping a record 100-plus gaming laptop models ahead of the back to school and holiday season. The combination of our energy-efficient Turing architecture and Max-Q technology enables beautifully crafted thin and light form factors that can deliver the performance of high-end gaming desktop or our next-generation console. At Computex in May, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX Studio laptops, a new design artist platform that extends our reach to the large, underserved market of creators. In the age of YouTube, creators and freelancers are rapidly growing population, but they have traditionally not had access to professional-grade workstations through online and retail channels. RTX Studio laptops are designed to meet their increasing complex workflows such as photorealistic ray tracing, AI image enhancement and ultra high-resolution video. Powered by our RTX GPUs and optimized software, RTX Studio laptops deliver performance that\u2019s up to 7x faster than that of the MacBook Pro. A total of 27 RTX Studio models have been announced by major OEMs. Sequential growth also benefited from the production ramp of the two new models of Nintendo Switch gaming console. We are expecting our console business to remain strong in Q3 before the seasonal production slowdown in Q4 when console-related revenue is expected to be fairly minimal, similar to last year. Moving to data center, revenue was $655 million, down 14% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially. In the vertical industries portion of the business, expanding AI workload drove sequential and year-over-year growth. In hyperscale portion, we continue to be impacted by relatively weak overall spending at a handful of CSPs. Sales of NVIDIA GPUs for use in the cloud were solid. While sales of internal hyperscale use were muted, the engineering focus on AI is growing. Let me give some color on each of these areas. We are building a broad base of customers across multiple industries as they adopt NVIDIA\u2019s platforms to harness the power of AI. Public sectors, higher education and financial services were among the key verticals driving growth this quarter. In addition, we won Lighthouse account deals in important industries that are on the cusp of being transformed by AI. For example, in retail, Wal-Mart is using NVIDIA GPUs to run some of its product demand forecasting models, slashing the time to do so in just 4 hours from several weeks on CPUs. By accelerating its data science workflow, Wal-Mart can improve its algorithms, reduce development cycles and test new features. Earlier this week, we announced breakthroughs for the fastest training and inference of the state-of-the-art model for natural language process understanding called BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a breakthrough AI language model that achieves a deeper sense of language, context and meaning. This can enable mere human comprehension in real-time by chat box, intelligent personal assistants and search engines. We are working with Microsoft as an early adopter of these advances. AI computing leadership is a high priority for NVIDIA. Last month, we set records for training deep learning neural network models on the latest MLPerf benchmarks, particularly in the most demanding areas. In just 7 months, we have achieved up to 80% speed-ups enabled by new algorithms and software optimizations across the full stack while using the same hardware. This is a direct result of the productive programming environment and flexibility of CUDA. Delivering AI at scale isn\u2019t just about silicon. It\u2019s about optimizing across the entire high-performance computing system. In fact, the NVIDIA AI platform is getting progressively faster. Every month, we publish new optimization and performance improvements to CUDA-X AI libraries, supporting every AI framework and development environment. All in, our ecosystem of developers is now 1.4 million strong. In setting these MLPerf records, we leveraged our new DGX SuperPOD AI supercomputer, demonstrating that leadership in AI research demands leadership in computing infrastructure. This system debuted in June at #22 on the TOP500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers at the annual International Supercomputing Conference. Used to meet the massive demand for autonomous vehicle development program, it is powered by more than 1,500 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs linked with Mellanox interconnects. We have made DGX SuperPOD available commercially to customers, essentially providing them with the turnkey supercomputer that they can assemble in weeks rather than months. It is roughly 400x smaller in size than other similarly performing TOP500 systems, which are built from thousands of servers. Also at the conference, we announced that by next year\u2019s end, we will make available to the ARM ecosystem NVIDIA\u2019s full stack of AI and HPC software, which accelerates more than 600 HPC applications and all AI frameworks. With this announcement, NVIDIA will accelerate all major CPU architectures, including x86, POWER and ARM. Lastly, regarding our pending acquisition of Mellanox, we have received regulatory approval in the U.S. and are engaged with regulators in Europe and China. The approval process is progressing as expected, and we continue to work toward closing the deal by the end of this calendar year. Moving to pro visualization, revenue reached $291 million, up 4% from our prior year and up 9% sequentially. Year-on-year and sequential growth was led by record revenue for mobile workstations with strong demand for new thin and light form factors. We had a great showing at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry\u2019s biggest annual conference held in Los Angeles. Our researchers won several Best in Show awards. In just a year since the launch of RTX ray tracing, over 40 design and creative applications with RTX technology had been announced by leading software vendors, including Adobe, Autodesk and Dassault systems and many others. NVIDIA RTX technology has reinvigorated the computer graphics industry by enabling researchers and developers to take a leap in photorealistic rendering, augmented reality and virtual reality. Finally, turning to automotive, Q2 revenue was $209 million, up 30% from a year ago and up 26% sequentially. This reflects growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development projects, including one particularly sizable development services transaction that was recognized in the quarter. In addition, in June, we announced a new partnership with the Volvo Group to develop AI and autonomous trucks utilizing NVIDIA\u2019s end-to-end AI platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing. The strategic partnership will enable Volvo Group to develop a wide range of autonomous driving solutions for freight transport, recycling collection, public transport, construction, mining, forestry and more. This collaboration is a great validation of our long-held position that every vehicle, not just cars but also trucks, shuttles, business, taxis and many others, will have autonomous capability 1 day. Autonomous features can bring enormous value to the trucking industry, in particular as the demand of online shopping put ever greater stress on the world\u2019s transport systems. Expectations for overnight or same-day deliveries create challenges that can only be met by autonomous trucks, which can operate 24 hours a day. To help address these needs, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to large-scale simulation to in-car computing. Multiple customers from OEMs like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo to Tier 1s like Bosch, Continental and ZF are already onboard. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025. Moving to the rest of the P&L, Q2 GAAP gross margins was 59.8% and non-GAAP was 60.1%, up sequentially, reflecting higher automotive development services, a favorable mix in gaming and lower component cost. GAAP operating expenses were $970 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $749 million, up 19% and 8% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.90, down 49% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.24, down 36% from a year ago. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect revenue to be $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62% and 62.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $980 million and $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $100 million to $120 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Jefferies conference, hardware and communications infrastructure summit, on August 27 and at the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 25. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for the questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess first question on gaming, how should we think about your outlook into the October quarter vis-\u00e0-vis kind of normal seasonality? How are you thinking about Switch within that? And considering now that you have full Turing lineup as well as content truly coming to the forefront here, how do you think about trends beyond the October quarter? Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. Colette, why don\u2019t you take the Switch question? And then I will take the rest of the RTX questions.\nColette Kress: Sure. From a gaming perspective, the overall Switch or the overall console business definitely is a seasonal business. We usually expect to see production ramping in Q2 and in Q3, with it coming down likely in Q4. So you should see Switch to be a portion definitely of our gaming business in Q3.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. C.J., thanks for your question. RTX as you know is \u2013 first of all, RTX is doing great. I think we have put all the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of games, the blockbuster games that adopted RTX is really snowballing. We announced several 6 games in the last couple of months. There is going to be some exciting announcements next week at gamescom. It\u2019s pretty clear now the future of gaming will include ray tracing. The number of software developers that create \u2013 with creative tools that adopted RTX is really quite spectacular. We now have 40 \u2013 over 40 ISV tools that was announced at SIGGRAPH that have accelerated ray tracing and video editing. And some of the applications\u2019 amazing AI capabilities for image optimization enhancement support RTX. And so looking forward, this is what I expect. I expect that ray tracing is going to drive a reinvigoration of gaming graphics. I expect that the over 100 laptops that we have RTX designed \u2013 RTX GPUs designed into is going to contribute our growth. Notebook gaming is one of the fastest-growing segments of the gaming platform world. The number of notebooks that are able to game is only a few percent, so it\u2019s extremely underexposed. And yet, we know that gamers are \u2013 like the rest of us, they like thin and light notebooks, but they like it to be able to run powerful games. And so this is an area that has grown significantly for us year-over-year, and we\u2019re expecting it to grow through the end of the \u2013 through the second half and through next year. And one of the things that\u2019s really exciting is our RTX Studio line that we introduced recently. We observed, and through our discussions with the PC industry, that the creatives are really underexposed and underserved by the latest technologies. And they want notebooks and they want PCs that have powerful graphics. They use it for 3D content creation and high-definition video editing and image optimization and things like that. And we introduced a brand-new line of computers that we call RTX Studio. Now the OEMs were so excited about it. And at SIGGRAPH, we now have 27 different laptops shipping and more coming. And so I think RTX is really geared for growth. We have great games coming. We got the SUPER line of GPUs. We have all of our notebooks that were designed into that we are ramping and of course, the new RTX Studio line. And so I expect this to be a growth market for us.\nChristopher James: Very helpful. If I could follow-up on the data center side, perhaps you can speak directly just to the hyperscale side, both internal and cloud, and whether you\u2019re seeing any green shoots, any signs of life there and how you are thinking about what that rate of recovery could look like over time?\nJen-Hsun Huang: With the exception of a couple of hyperscalers, C.J., I would \u2013 we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. In the area of training, the thing that\u2019s really exciting everybody, and everybody is racing towards, is training these large gigantic natural language understanding models, language models. The transformer model that was introduced by Google, called BERT, has since been enhanced into XLned and RoBERTa and, gosh, so many different, GP2, and Microsoft\u2019s MASS. And there are so many different versions of these language models. And in the AI, NLU, natural language understanding, is one of the most important areas that everybody\u2019s racing to go to. And so, these models are really, really large. It\u2019s over 1,000x larger than image models that we\u2019re training just a few years ago, and they\u2019re just gigantic models. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we built the DGX SuperPOD so that we could train these gigantic models in a reasonable amount of time. The second area \u2013 so that\u2019s training in the hyperscalers. The second area where we are seeing enormous amounts of activity has to do with trying to put these conversational AI models into services so that they could be interactive and in real time. Whereas photo tagging and photo enhancement is something that you could put off-line and you could do that while you have excess capacity when it\u2019s off of the most busy time of the day. You can\u2019t do that with language and conversational AI. You better to respond to the person in real time. And so the performance that\u2019s required is significant. But more importantly, the number of models necessary for conversational AI from speech recognition to language understanding to recommendation systems to text-to-speech to wave synthesis these 5, 6, 7 models have to be processed in real time \u2013 in series and in real time so that you can have a reasonable conversation with the AI agent. And so these type of activities is really driving interest and activity at all of the hyperscalers. My expectation is that this is going to continue to be a big growth opportunity for us. But more importantly, in addition to that, we\u2019re seeing that AI is \u2013 the wave of AI is going from the cloud to the enterprise to the edge and all the way out to the autonomous systems. The place where we\u2019re seeing a lot of excitement, and we talked about that in the past and we\u2019re seeing growth there, has to do with the vertical industry enterprises that are starting to adopt AI to create new products, whether it\u2019s a delivery robot or some kind of a Chat Bot or the ability to detect fraud in financial services, these applications in vertical industries are really spreading all over the place. There\u2019s some over 4,000 AI start-ups around the world. And the way that we engage them is they use our platform to start developing AI in the cloud. And as you know, we\u2019re the only AI platform that\u2019s available on-prem and in every single cloud. And so they can use our AI platforms for \u2013 in all the clouds, which is driving our cloud computing, external cloud computing growth. And then they can also use it on-prem if their usage really grows significantly. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why our Tesla for OEMs and DGX is growing. And so we\u2019re seeing broad-based excitement around AI as they use it for their products and new services. And these 4,000, 4,500 start-ups around the world is really driving consumption of that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya: Alright thanks for taking my questions. I actually had 2 as well, one quick one for Colette and one for Jensen. Colette, good to see the gross margin recovery getting into October is this 62% to 63% range a more sustainable level and perhaps a level you could grow off of as sales get more normalized levels? And then a bigger question is for Jensen. Again, on the data center side, Jensen, when I look back between \u2013 2015 to 2018, your data center business essentially grew 10x. And then the last year has been a tough one with the slowdown in cloud CapEx and so forth. When do you think your data center starts to grow back on a year-to-year \u2013 on a year-on-year basis? Can that happen sometime \u2013 later this year? And then just longer term, what is the right way to think about this business? Does it go back to prior levels? Does it go at a different phase? This is the one part of the business that I think is toughest for us to model, so any color would be very helpful.\nColette Kress: Great, so let me start first with your question, Vivek, regarding gross margins. Yes, thanks for recognizing that we are moving towards our expectations that, over time, we\u2019ll continue to see our overall volumes improve. Essentially, our business is normalized. We\u2019ve reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters. And this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward, is mix is the largest driver, what drives our overall gross margins and our gross margin improvements.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Vivek, if you look at the last several years, there\u2019s no question our data center business has grown a lot. And my expectation is that it\u2019s going to grow a lot more, and let me explain to you why. Aside from a couple \u2013 a few of uncontrollable circumstances and the exception of a couple of large customers, the overall trend, the broad-based trend, of our data center business is upward, to the right. And it is growing very nicely. There\u2019s a couple of different dynamics that\u2019s causing that on first principles to grow. And of course, one of them is as AI is well known now to require accelerated computing, our computing architecture is really ideal for it. AI is not just one network. It\u2019s thousands of different types of networks, and these networks are getting more and more complex over time, the amount of data you have to process is enormous. And so like all software programs, you cannot predict exactly how the software is going to get programmed. And having a programmable architecture like CUDA and yet optimized for AI like Tensor Cores that we\u2019ve created is really the ideal architecture. We know also that AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. The ability for machines to learn and write software by itself and write software that no humans can write is pretty extraordinary. And the applications of AI, as you guys are watching yourself, are just spreading in every single industry. And so the way we think about AI is in waves, if you will. The first wave of AI is developing the computer architecture, and that was the first part where \u2013 that\u2019s when a lot of people discovered who we are, and we emerged into the world of high-performance computing in AI. The second wave is applying the AI for cloud service providers or hyperscalers. They have a large amount of data. They have a lot of consumer applications. Many of them are not life-critical and so, therefore, the application of an early technology \u2013 early-adoption technology was really viable. And so you saw hyperscalers adopt AI. And the thing that\u2019s really exciting for us is beyond recommendations, beyond image enhancement, the area where we believe the most important application for AI is likely conversational AI. Most people talking and asking questions and talking to their mobile devices and looking for something or asking for directions instead of having a page of \u2013 a list of options, it responds with an answer that is very likely a good one. The next phase of AI is what we call vertical industry enterprise AI. And this is where companies are using it not just to accelerate the business process internally, but they\u2019re using AI to create new products and services. They could be new medical instruments to IoT-based medical instruments to monitor your health. It could be something related to an application that \u2013 used for financial services for forecasting or for fraud detection. It could be some kind of device that delivers pizza to you, delivery bots. And the combination of IoT and artificial intelligence, for the very first time, you actually have the software capabilities to make use of all of these sensors that you\u2019re putting all over the world. And that\u2019s the next phase of growth. And it affects companies from large industrials, transportation companies, retailers, you name it. Health care companies, you name it. And so that phase of growth of AI is the phase that we\u2019re about to enter into. And then the longer term is an industry that we all know to be extremely large, but it takes time because it\u2019s life-critical, and it has to do with transportation. It\u2019s a $100 trillion industry. We know it\u2019s going to be automated. We know that everything that moves in the future will be autonomous or have autonomous capabilities. And that\u2019s just a matter of time before we realize its full potential. And so the net of it all is that I believe that AI is the single most powerful technology force of our time, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all in on it. And we know that acceleration and accelerated computing is the perfect model for that. And it started in the cloud, but it\u2019s going to keep moving out into the edge and through data centers and enterprises and hopefully \u2013 well, eventually, all the way out into autonomous devices and machines in the real world. And so this is a big market, and I\u2019m super enthusiastic about it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I had two as well, one for Jensen and the other for Colette. Jensen, you guys called out inference as a significant contributor to growth in data center last quarter. I think you guys talked about it being a double-digit percentage contributor, curious what you saw from inference in the quarter. And more importantly, if you can talk about the outlook, both near term and long term, as it relates to inference, that\u2019ll be helpful. And then secondly, for Colette, just want to double click on the gross margin question. The sequential improvement that you\u2019re guiding to is a pretty significant number. So I was just hoping if you can kind of break it down for us in terms of overall volume growth mix dynamics, both between segments and within segments and also to the extent DRAM pricing is impacting that, any color on that will be helpful as well. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes, Toshiya, I got to tell you, I\u2019m less good at normal pre \u2013 near-term productions than I am good at thinking about long-term dynamics. But let me talk to you about inference. Our inference business is \u2013 remains robust. It\u2019s double digits. It\u2019s a large part of our business. And \u2013 but more importantly, the two dynamics that I think are near term and that\u2019s going to drive growth, number one is interactive conversational AI, interactive conversational AI inference. If you simply ask a chat bot a simple question, where is the closest pizza and you would \u2013 pizza shop, and you would like to have a conversation with this bot, it would have to do speech recognition, it has to understand what it is that you asked about, it has to look it up in a recommender based on the locations you\u2019re at, maybe your preferences of styles of pizza and the price ranges that you\u2019re interested and how far you\u2019re willing to go, to go get it. It has to recommend a pizza shop for you to go to. It has to then translate that from text-to-speech and then into human \u2013 a human understand a voice. And those models have to happen in just a few \u2013 ideally, a few hundred milliseconds. Currently, it\u2019s not that. And it makes it really hard for these services to be deployed quite broadly and used for all kinds of different applications. And so that\u2019s the near-term opportunity, it\u2019s interactive conversational AI inference. And you could just imagine every single hyperscaler racing to go make this possible because recently, we had some important breakthroughs in machine learning language models. The BERT model that I mentioned earlier is really, really an important development, and it\u2019s caused a large number of derivatives that has improved upon it and so near-term conversational AI inference. But, we are also seeing near term the inference at the edge. There are many types of applications where because of the laws of physics reasons, the speed of light reasons or the economics reasons or data sovereignty reasons, it\u2019s not possible to stream the data to the cloud and have the inference done at the cloud. You have to do that at the edge. You need the latency to be low, the amount of data that you\u2019re streaming is continuous. And so you don\u2019t want to be paying for that line rate the whole time, and maybe the data is of great confidentiality or privacy. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of excitement and a lot of development for edge AI. Smart retail, smart warehouses, smart factories, smart cities, smart airports, you just make a list of those kind of things, basically locations where there is a lot of activity, where safety or cost or large amount of materials is passing through, you could just imagine the applications. All of those really want to be edge computing systems and edge inference systems. And so those are near term \u2013 two near-term drivers, and I think it\u2019s fair to say that both of them are quite large opportunities.\nColette Kress: So to answer your question regarding gross margin in a little bit more detail, probably our largest area that we expect improvement in terms of our mix is our mix return regarding our overall gaming business. We expect to have a full quarter of our SUPER lineup within the next quarter including our RTX as well as our notebook becoming a bigger mix as well as it grows. These drivers are one of the largest reasons why we see that growth in our gross margin. We always think about our component cost, our overall cost of manufacturing, so this is always baked in over time, but we\u2019ll continue to see improvements on that as well.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Again on your data center business, many of your peers on the compute and storage side are seeing spending recovery by cloud and hyperscalers in the second half of this year after a similar weak first half of the year. You guys saw some growth in Q2 driven primarily by enterprise. It seems like you had some broadening out of the customer spending this quarter. Inferencing continues to see strong momentum. Would you guys expect that this translates into a double-digit percentage sequential growth in data center in Q3 off of the low base in Q2?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our hyperscale data center with a few customers don\u2019t give us very much \u2013 we don\u2019t get very much visibility from a handful of customers in hyperscale. However, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth and excitement in data centers. And the way to think about data center, our data center business consists of hyperscale training, internal training, hyperscale inference, cloud computing \u2013 and that\u2019s hyperscale, and that cloud is a public cloud. And then we have vertical industry enterprise, what sometimes we call enterprise, vertical industry enterprise, it could be transportation companies, retailers, telcos, vertical industry adoption of AI either to accelerate their business or to develop new products and services. And then the \u2013 so when you look at our data center from that perspective and these pieces, although we don\u2019t see as much \u2013 we don\u2019t get as much visibility as we like in a couple of the large customers, the rest of the hyperscalers, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth. And so we\u2019re experiencing the enthusiasm and the energy that maybe the others are and so we will keep updating you guys as we go. We will see how it goes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had two. I guess first for Jensen, Volta\u2019s been around now for about 2 years. Do you see signs of demand maybe building up ahead of the new set of nanometer products, whenever that comes out? I guess I\u2019m just wondering whether there\u2019s some element of this is more around product cadence that gets resolved as you do roll out the product. That\u2019s the first question. And then I guess, the second question, Colette, is of the $300 million growth into October, it sounds like Switch is pretty flat, but I\u2019m wondering if you can give us maybe some qualitative sense of where the growth is coming from, is it maybe like two-third gaming and one-third data centers, something like that? Thanks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, Volta data center products can churn that fast. We gamers could churn products quickly because they\u2019re bought and sold one at a time. But data centers data center infrastructure really has to be planned properly, and the build-out takes time. And we expect Volta to be successful all the way through next year. And software still continues to be improved on it. We\u2019re still improving systems on it. And in fact, just 1 year in just 1 year, we improved our AI performance on Volta by almost 2x, 80%. And so, you could just imagine the amount of software that\u2019s built on top of Volta and all the Tensor Cores and all the GPUs connected with NVLink and the large number of nodes that are connected to build supercomputers. The software of building these systems, large-scale systems, is really, really hard. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why you hear people talk about chips, but they never show up because building the software is just an enormous undertaking. The number of software engineers we have in the company is in the thousands, and we have the benefit of having built on top of this architecture for over 1.5 decades. And so, when we\u2019re able to deploy into data centers as quickly as we do, I think we kind of lose sight of how hard it is to do that in the first place. The last time a new processor entered into a data center was an x86 Xeon, and you just don\u2019t bring processors in the data centers that frequently or that easily. And so, I think the way to think about Volta is that it\u2019s surely in its prime, and it\u2019s going to keep continue to do well all the way through next year.\nColette Kress: In regard to our guidance on revenue, and we do guide in terms of the total. You have seen, in this last quarter, we executed a sequential increase really focusing on moving to a normalization of our gaming business. And we\u2019re now approaching the second half of the year getting ready for the back to school and the holidays. So, you should expect also our gaming business to continue to grow to reach that full normalization by the end of Q3. We do expect the rest of our platforms to likely also grow. We have a couple different models on how that will come out. But yes, we do expect our data center business to grow, and then we\u2019ll see on the rest of our businesses as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. I guess the first one is Jensen, if you have any, I guess, high-level qualitative commentary on how the new SUPER upgrades of your Turing platform have been received in the market and how you might think about them progressing through the year. And then, I guess, the second question is a bigger one. Intel\u2019s talked quite openly about One API. The software stack at Xilinx is progressing with Versal ACAP. I mean you guys get a lot of credit for the decade of work that you\u2019ve done on CUDA. But I wonder if you might comment on if you\u2019ve seen any movement in the competitive landscape on the software side for the data center space. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: SUPER is off to a great start. Goodness, SUPER is off to a super start. And if you look at if you do channel checks all over, even though we\u2019ve got a lot of products in the channel and we last quarter was a transitional quarter for us actually. And we didn\u2019t we shipped SUPER later in the quarter. But because the entire ecosystem and all of our execution engines are so primed, we were able to ship a fair number through the channel. And so, and yet, if you do spot checks all around the world, they\u2019re sold out almost everywhere. And the pricing in the spot market is drifting higher than MSRP. That just tells you something about demand. And so that\u2019s really exciting. SUPER is off to a super start for and at this point, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that we\u2019re going to buy a new graphics card, and it\u2019s going to the last 2, 3, 4 years to not have ray tracing is just crazy. Ray tracing content just keeps coming out. And between the performance of SUPER and the fact that it has ray tracing hardware, it\u2019s going to be super well positioned for throughout all of next year. Your question about APIs and software programmability, APIs is just one of the issues. The large issue about processors is how do you program it. The reason why x86s and CPUs are so popular is because they solve the great challenge of software developers: how to program a computer and how to program a computer and how to compile for that computer is a paramount concern to computer science, and it\u2019s an area of tremendous research. Going from single CPU to multi-core CPUs was a great challenge. Going from multi-core CPUs to multi-node multi-core CPUs is an enormous challenge. And yet, when we created CUDA in our GPUs, we went from 1 CPU core or one processor core to a few to now, in the case of large-scale systems, millions of processor cores. And how do you program such a computer across multi-GPU, multi-node? It\u2019s a concept that\u2019s not easy to grasp. And so, I don\u2019t really know how one programming approach or a simple API is going to make 7 different type of weird things work together. And I can\u2019t make it fit in my head. But programming isn\u2019t as simple as a PowerPoint slide, I guess. And I think it\u2019s just time will tell whether one programming approach could fit 7 different types of processors when no time in history has it ever happened.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the strength in the automotive business. Looks like the services piece of that is getting to be bigger, what\u2019s the outlook for that part of the business? And can you give us a sense of the mix between services and components at this point?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. Thanks, Joe. Our approach to autonomous vehicles comes in basically 2 parts. The first part is a full stack, which is building the architected processor, the system, the system software and all of the driving applications on top, including the deep neural nets. The second part of it, we call that a full stack self-driving car computer. The second part of DRIVE includes an end-to-end AV development system. For those who would like to use our processors, use our system software but create their own applications, we created a system that allows basically shares with them our computing infrastructure that we built for ourselves that allows them to do end-to-end development from deep learning development to the application of AV to simulating that application to doing regression testing of that application before they deploy it into a car. And the two systems that we use there is called DGX for training and Constellation for simulation and what is called Replay. And then the third part of our business model is development agreements, otherwise known as NRE. These 3 elements, full stack computer, end-to-end development flow and NRE project development product development consists of the overall DRIVE business. And so, although the cars will take several years to go into production, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in working with us to develop self-driving cars using our development systems and entering into development projects. And so, we\u2019re the number of autonomous vehicle projects is quite large around the world as you can imagine. And so, my sense is that we\u2019re going to continue to do well here. The additional part of autonomous vehicles and where the capability has been derived and is going to seal up more near-term opportunities has to do with things like delivery shuttles, self-driving shuttles and maybe cargo movers inside walled warehouses. Those kinds of autonomous machines require basically the same technology, but it\u2019s sooner and easier to deploy. And so, we are seeing a lot of excitement around that area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the improved performance. At your Analyst Day back a couple of months ago, you had highlighted the installed base opportunity for RTX. And I think at that point in time, you talked about 50% being Pascal base, 48% being pre-Pascal. You also alluded to the fact that you were seeing a positive mix shift higher in terms of the price points of this RTX cycle. So, I\u2019m curious, where do we stand on the current product cycle? And what are you seeing currently as we go through this product cycle on the Turing platforms?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We launched well, first of all, the answer is that RTX adoption is faster than Pascal\u2019s adoption if you normalize to time 0 of launch. The reason for that is Pascal launched top to bottom on the same day. And as you guys know, we weren\u2019t able to do that for Turing. But if we did that for Turing, the adoption rate is actually faster. And to me, it\u2019s a rather sensible. And the reason for that is because Pascal was basically DX12. And Maxwell was DX12. And Turing is the world\u2019s first DXR, the first ray tracing GPU, brand-new functionality, brand-new API and a lot more performance. And so, I think it\u2019s sensible that Turing\u2019s adoption is going to be rapid. The second element of Turing is something that we\u2019ve never talked about before. We\u2019re mentioning it more and more because it\u2019s such an exciting book market for us is notebooks. The install base of Pascal has a very, very little notebook in it. And the reason for that is because, in the past, we were never able to put a high-performance gaming GPU into a thin and light notebook until we invented Max-Q. And in combination with our energy efficiency, we were able to we\u2019re now able to put a 2080 into a laptop, and it\u2019s still beautiful. And so, this is effectively a brand-new growth market for us. And with so few people and so few gamers in the world that are able to game on a laptop, I think this is going to be a nice growth market for us. And then the new market that we introduced and launched this last quarter is called RTX Studio. And this is an underserved segment of the market where consumers, enthusiasts, they could be artists that are working on small firms, they need powerful computers to do their work. They need powerful computers to do rendering and high-definition video editing. And yet it\u2019s underserved by workstations because workstations are really sold on a B2B basis into large enterprises. And so, we aligned all of the OEMs and created a whole new line of notebooks called RTX Studio. And the enthusiasm has been great. We\u2019ve launched 27 different laptops, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the results of that. This is tens of millions of people who are creators. Some of them professionals, some of them hobbyists. And they use Adobe suites, they use Autodesk in their suites and some of them use SolidWorks and some of them use all kinds of renders, like blender. And these are 3D artists and video artists, and this digital content creation is the modern way of creativity. And so, this is an underserved market that we\u2019re excited to go serve with RTX Studio.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Colette. My first question is on data center. So, I know you say that you have a broad-based growth except for a few hyperscalers. But you only grew at 3% sequentially, about $20 million. That doesn\u2019t sound like broad-based growth to me unless like did the hyperscalers get worse or are they just still so much bigger than like the rest of it? I guess, what\u2019s going on in data center? How do I wrap my head around like broad-based growth with relatively minimal growth observed?\nColette Kress: So, to answer your question here, Stacy, on what we refer to when we\u2019re discussing the broad-based growth is the substantial expansion that we have on the types of customers and the industries that we are now approaching. As you know, even a year ago, we had a very, very small base in terms of industry-based hyper excuse me, industry-based AI workloads that they were using. Over this last quarter, we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth as we roll out all different types of AI solutions, both across the U.S. and worldwide, to these overall customers. Our hyperscalers, again, a couple of them, not necessarily growing, some of them are flat and some of them are growing depending on whether or not that\u2019s for cloud instances or whether or not they\u2019re using it for internal use. So, we believe that our continued growth with the industries is important for us for the long term to expand the use of AI and we are just really pleased with what we are seeing in that growth this quarter.\nOperator: I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Jensen for any closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, everyone. We are happy with our results this quarter and our return to growth across our platforms. Gaming is doing great. It\u2019s great to see NVIDIA RTX reinvigorating the industry. GeForce has several growth drivers. Ray traced games continue to gain momentum. A large number of gaming laptops are rolling out, and our new Studio platform is reaching the large underserved community of creators. Outside a few hyperscalers, we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth in data centers. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. More and more enterprises are using AI to create new products and services while leveraging AI to drive ultra efficiency and speed in their business. And with hyperscalers racing to harness recent breakthroughs in conversational AI, we see growing engagements in training as well as interactive conversational inference. RTX, CUDA accelerated computing, AI, autonomous vehicles, the work we\u2019re doing is important, impactful and incredibly fun. We\u2019re just grateful there is so much of it. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks Simona. Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion in line with our outlook and down 31% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business, revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our touring lineup with the launch of mid-range GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point starting at $149. New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650 which bring Turing to the high volume PC gaming side for both desktops and laptops. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal based predecessors leveraging new Shader innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and adaptive shading all with the incredibly power efficient architecture. We expect continued growth in the gaming laptops this year. GeForce gaming laptops are one of the shining spots of the consumer PC market. This year OEMs have built a record of nearly 100 GeForce gaming laptops. GeForce laptops start at $799 and all the way up to an amazing GeForce RTX 2080 4K laptops that are more powerful than even next generation consoles. The content ecosystem for Ray traced games is gaining significant momentum. At the March game developers conference, Ray tracing sessions were packed. Support for Ray tracing was announced by the industry's most important game engines, Microsoft DSR, Epics on unreal engine and unity. Ray tracing will be the standard for next generation games. In March at our GPU technology conference, we also announced more details on our cloud gaming strategy through our GeForce NOW service and the newly announced [indiscernible] alliance. GeForce NOW is a GeForce gaming PC in the cloud for the 1 billion PCs that are not game ready expanding our reach well beyond today's 200 million GeForce gamers. It's an open platform that allows gamers to play the games they own instantly in the cloud on any PC or Mac anywhere they like. The service currently has 300,000 monthly active users with 1 million more on the waitlist. To scale out to millions of gamers worldwide, we announced the GeForce NOW alliance expanding GFN through partnerships with the global telecom providers, SoftBank in Japan and LG UPlus in South Korea will be among the first to launch GFN later this year. NVIDIA, we'll develop the software and manage the service and share the subscription revenue with alliance partners. GFN runs on NVIDIA's edge computing servers as telcos raise to offer the new services for their 5G networks, GFN is an ideal new 5G application. Moving to data center, revenue was $634 million down 10% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending. While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely, others paused or cut back. Despite the uneven demand backdrop, the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call. First, inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer internet companies. As announced at GTC, Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscale such as Google, Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers. A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adopting our GPUs for influence including LinkedIn, Expedia Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The contribution of inference to our data center revenue is now well into the double-digit percent. Second, we expanded our reach in enterprise teaming up with major OEMs to introduce the T4 enterprise and edge computing servers. These are optimized to run the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries for AI and data analytics. Within easy to deploy software stack from NVIDIA and our ecosystem partners, this wave of NVIDIA edge AI computing systems enables companies in the world's largest industries, transportation, manufacturing, industrial, retail, healthcare and agricultural to bring intelligence to the edge where the customers operate. And third, we made significant progress in data center rendering and graphics. We unveiled a new RTX server configuration packing 40 GPUs into an 8-used space and up to 32 servers in a pod providing unparalleled density, efficiency and scalability. With a complete stack, this server design is optimized for three data center graphic workflows rendering, remote, workstation and cloud gaming. The rendering opportunity is starting to take shape with early RTX server deployment at leading studios, including Disney, Pixar and [indiscernible]. In the quarter, we announced our pending acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion, which we believe will strengthen our strategic position in data center. Once complete the acquisition, we will unite two of the world's leading companies in high performance computing. Together NVIDIA's computing platform and Mellanox's interconnects power over 250 of the world's top 500 supercomputers and have as customers every major cloud service provider and computer maker. Data centers in the future will be architect as giant compute engines with tens and thousands of compute nodes, designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance. With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize data center scale workloads, across the entire computing networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating costs for customers. Together we can create better AI computing systems for the cloud to enterprise to the edge. As stated at the time of the announcement, we look forward to closing the acquisition by the end of this calendar year. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $266 million up 6% from a prior year and down 9% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by both desktop and mobile workstations, while the sequential decline was largely seasonal. Areas of strength included the public sector, oil and gas and manufacturing. Emerging applications such as AI/AR/VR contributed an estimated 38% a pro visualization revenue. The real-time Ray tracing capabilities of RTX are a game changer for the visual effects industry and we are seeing tremendous momentum in the ecosystem. At UTC, we announced that the world's top 3D application providers have adopted NVIDIA RTX in their product releases set for later this year including Adobe, Autodesk Chaos group, Dassault and Pixar. With this rich software ecosystem, NVIDIA RTX is transforming the 3D market. For example, Pixar is using NVIDIA RTX Ray tracing on its upcoming films what a digital is using it for upcoming Disney projects and Siemens and x Ray trace studios users will be able to generate rendered images up to 4x faster in their product design workflows. We are excited to see the tremendous value in NVIDIA RTX is bringing to the millions of creators and designers served by ecosystem partners. Finally, turning to automotive, Q1 revenue was $166 million up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next generation AI cockpit solutions, an autonomous vehicle development deals. At GTC we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA's end-to-end platform to develop train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA drive constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus. We also announced the public availability of Drive Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what's possible to achieve in the real world. Constellation will be reported in our data center market platform. And we introduced NVIDIA Safety Force Field, a computational defensive driving framework that shield autonomous vehicles from collisions mathematically verified and validated in simulation Safety Force Field will prevent a vehicle from creating escalating or contributing to an unsafe starting situation. We continue to believe that every vehicle will have an autonomous capability one day whether with driver or driverless. To help make that vision a reality NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing and Toyota is our first major win that validates the strategy. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025. Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q1 GAAP gross margins was $58.4% and non-GAAP was 59% down year-on-year to lower gaming margins and mix up sequentially from Q4 which had $128 million charge from DRAM boards and other components. GAAP operating expenses were $938 million and non-GAAP operating expenses were $753 million up 21% and 16% year-on-year respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020, while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth. Namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.88. We did not make any stock repurchases in the quarter following the announcement of the pending Mellonox acquisition. We remain committed to returning $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases. So far, we have returned $800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. With that let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth for Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectation earlier in the quarter when our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019. The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter and visibility remains low. In gaming, the CPU shortage while improving will affect the initial round of our laptop business. For Q2, we expect revenue to be $2.55 billion plus or minus 2%. We expect a stronger second half than the first half and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2% and 59.5% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, $765 million respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OIME or both expected to be income of approximately $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR Web site. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5; at the RBC Future of Mobility Conference on June 6; and at the NASDAQ Investor Conference on June 13. Our next earnings call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on August 15. We will now open the call for questions. Operator will you please poll.\nQ - Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you've seen in the data center segment. And whether or not, or what you're looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind it. I guess what I'm really asking is kind of what's changed over the last let's call it three months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business three months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter. As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward, continuing with our CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of a pause. So, as we look in terms of -- with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility not the best visibility going forward, but still rock solid to what we think are our benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform. Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscale as well as the enterprises as we think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But, we'll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started three months ago.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the gaming side last quarter you talked about that being down I think it was termed as being down slightly for the full year. Is that still the expectation or how has that changed?\nColette Kress: So, at this time, we don't plan on giving a full year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming all of the still drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in the line. While the drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track. But, we're not providing guidance at this time for the full year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the last earnings call, you had mentioned China gaining demand is a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jen-Hsun had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go forward basis and maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Sure. China looks like fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent's releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now open in Asia and games are available from the West. So, there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There's some 300 million PC gamers in China and. And then, people are expecting it to grow. We're expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1 plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so, things look fine.\nHarlan Sur: Thanks for that. And then, as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look, kind of they get launched October, November timeframe either a total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting you know real-time great racing as well as some of your deal assess capabilities?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Well, it's seasonal second half the year, we expect to see some great games. We won't preannounce anybody else games for them. But, this is this is a great PC cycle because it is the end of the console cycle. And PCs are where the actions at these days. With Battle Royale and Esports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant. Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to Ray tracing. And at this point I think it's fairly safe to say that that the leadership position that we've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next generation gaming Ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have Ray tracing and some of them already announced it and the partnerships that we've developed are fantastic Microsoft DXR is supporting Ray tracing, Unity supporting ray tracing, Epic is supporting Ray tracing, leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting Ray tracing and movie studios, Pixar has adopted -- announced that they're using RTX and will use artifacts to accelerate their rendering of films. And so, Adobe and Autodesk jumped on to RTX and that will bring Ray tracing to their content and their tools. And so, I think at this point it's fair to say that that Ray tracing is the next generation and it's going to be adopted all over the world.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thank you. I guess the first question is for Colette. So, what went into decision to pull for your guidance versus just cutting it. Is it really just fear around how long it could take for you no data center to come back? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Yes. I'll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we are guiding we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter something that we didn't feel was a true representative of our business. And we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward. We are still experiencing I think the uncertainty as a result of the pause in terms of -- with the overall hyperscale data centers. And we do believe that's going to extend into Q2. However, we do know and expect that our Q2 -- assuming our H2 will likely be sizably larger than our overall H1. And the core dynamics of our business at every level is exactly what we expected. Just that said though, we're going to return to just quarterly guidance at this time.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative if not quantitative sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July. How that breaks out is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming. Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yes. So, when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo switch to start again in sizable amount. Once we move into Q2 and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks for taking the question. Jen-Hsun, I had a follow up on the data center business. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing not only from your hyperscale customers which you've talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and the HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side. You guys talk about this pause that you're seeing from your customer base. When you're having conversations with your customers, did they give you a reason as to why they're pausing is it, too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it, optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful too. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Hyperscale are digesting the capacity they have. At this point, I think it's fairly clear that in the second half of last year they took on a little bit too much capacity. And so, everybody is has paused to give themselves a chance to digest. However, our business on inference is doing great. And we're working with CSPs all over the world to accelerate their inference models. Now the reason why recently the inference activity has gotten just off the charts because of breakthroughs in what we call conversational AI. In fact, today I think I just saw it today, but have known about this work for some time. Harry Shum's Group, Microsoft AI Research Group today announced their multitask DNN, general language understanding model and it broke benchmark records all over the place. And basically, what this means is the three fundamental components of conversational AI. which is speech recognition, natural language understanding which this multitask DNN is a breakthrough in and it's based on a piece of work that Google did recently called BERT. And then, text to speech all of the major pieces of a conversational AI are now put together. Of course, it's going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train. And in the case of Microsoft's network was trained on vault to GPUs and these systems require large amounts of memory, the models are enormous takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so, we're seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI and across the board Internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational. So that you can access through phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere. The work that we're doing in industries makes a ton of sense. We're seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to healthcare to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they're collecting and I heard a statistic just the other day from a talk to [indiscernible] that some 90% of today's data was created just two years ago and it's being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world. And so, if you want to put that data to work and you could create the models using our systems, our GPUs for training, and then you can extend that all the way out to the edge. This last quarter, we started to talk about our enterprise server based on T4. This inference engine that has been really successful for us at the CSPs is now going out into the edge and we call them edge servers and enterprise servers. And these edge systems are going to do AI basically instantaneously. It's too much data to move all the way to the cloud. You might have data sovereignty concerns, you want to have very, very low latency, maybe it needs to have multi-sensor fusion capabilities, so it understands the context better. For example, what it sees and what it hears has to be harmonious. And so, you need that kind of AI, those kind of sensor computing at the edge. And so, we're seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it the intelligent edge. Some people call edge computing and now with 5G networks coming, we're seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we're making. Those are the activity that we're seeing.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you. As a quick follow-up on the gaming side, Colette, can you characterize product mix within gaming. You saw in the current quarter, you cited mix as one of the key reasons why gross margins were down year-over-year albeit off a high base going into Q2 in the back half. Would you expect SKU mix within gaming to improve or stay the same? I ask because it's important for gross margins obviously. Thank you.\nColette Kress: Yes. When you look at our sequential gross margin increase that will be influenced by our larger revenue or larger revenue and better mix, which you're correct is our largest driver of our gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo switch back up and that does have lower gross margins than the company average influencing therefore our Q2 gross margin guidance that we provided. As we look forward towards the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. We've talked quite a bit about GeForce now in the prepared remarks and at the Analyst Day. It seems like cloud gaming is going to be a big topic at [83] [ph]. Is that going to be your preferred way to go-to-market with cloud gaming and do you expect to sell GPUs to sort of traditional cloud vendors in non-GeForce NOW fashion?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud. And our strategy for our building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so, we'll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack and when we host the service, we will move toward a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world who would like to provision the service at their edge servers and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with their 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator. In all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low. We have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so, our that's our basic strategy. And we also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers. Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. Amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also Ray tracing. And so, the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that's possible.\nJoe Moore: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jen-Hsun. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at normal levels, when you look at Q2 guidance like all the issues regarding inventory and ratios are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more than normalized run rate for your PC gaming business? And then, Jen-Hsun, on the data center -- NVIDIA has dominated the training market inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There's a lot of talk of software being written more on the framework level. How should we get the confidence that at your lead-in training will help you maintain good lead and inference also? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question. So, let's start with your first part of the question regarding how we reached overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day and at the beginning of the quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: NVIDIA strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition ASR. Our company is focused on accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because the world's body of software is really gigantic and the world's body of software continues to evolve and AI is nowhere near done. We're probably at the first couple of innings of AI of that. And so, the amount of software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve. Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today whether it's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be a classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework in machine learning overall. And there are so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms. This whole body of software doesn't run on a single function accelerator. If you would like the body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so, the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of CUDA, so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and it's being announced being integrated into machine learning pipelines in the cloud and elsewhere. And then, also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that that don't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so, our company is focused on accelerated computing. And speaking of inference that's one of the reasons why we're so successful in inference right now. We're seeing really great pickup. And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application and let's just use one application, one very, very exciting one, conversational AI, you would have to do speech recognition, you would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what did the speeches -- you might have to convert, you have to translate to another language. Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search and then after that you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech. While some of it could be 8-bit integer, some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point in some of it because of the development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point. And so, the mix precision nature and the computational algorithm nature, flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications. To not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not, we run every single model. And if it doesn't currently run well, we'll help you make it run. And so, the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So, our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real workloads. And we're going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is a question for Colette. Colette, you said inference and rendering within data center were both up very strongly, but I guess that has to imply that like the training flash acceleration pieces is quite weak even weaker than the overall. And given those should be adding to efficiency, I'm just surprised it's down that much. Is this truly just digestion? I mean is it share I mean like your competitor is now shipping some parts here? I mean I guess how do we get confidence that just we haven't seen a ceiling on this? I mean do you think given the trajectory you can exit the year above the prior peaks I guess you kind of have to feel given at least the qualitative outlook on the cycle. I guess maybe just any color you can give us on any of those trends would be super helpful.\nColette Kress: So, as we discussed, Stacy. We are targeting many of the hyperscale definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues. Also in terms of the training; the training instances that they will need for the cloud or for internal use, absolutely. We have some that have pods and going through all those period, so that we do believe because this will come back. We do believe as we look out into the future that they will need that overall deep learning for much of their research as well as many of their workloads. So, no concern on that. But right now, we do see a pause. I will turn it over to Jen-Hsun to see if he has additional comments.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Let's see. I think that that when it comes down to training, if your infrastructure team tells you not to buy anything. The thing that suffers is time to market and in some amount of experimentation that allows you to better pause and waiting longer. And then, I should -- I think that for computer vision type of algorithms and recommendation type of algorithms those that posture may not be may not be impossible. However, the type of work that that everybody is now jumping on top of which is natural language understanding and conversational AI and the breakthrough that Microsoft just announced. If you want to keep up with that you're going to have to buy much, much larger machines. And I'm looking forward to that and I expect that that's going to happen. But in the latter part of last year Q4 and Q1 of this year, we did see pause from the hyperscalers. But, I don't expect it to last.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. This is a quick follow-up. I just wanted to ask about the regulatory around Mellanox in the context of what we're seeing out of China now. How do we sort of gauge the risk of potential further deterioration in relationship sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around deal. I we've seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Well, on first principles. The acquisition is going to enable data centers around the world whether it's U.S. or elsewhere China to be able to advance much, much more quickly. Now we're going to invest and building infrastructure technology and as a combined company, we'll be able to do that much better. And so, this is good for customers and it's great for customers in China. The two matters whether it's -- the two matters that we're talking about just are different. One is related to competition in a -- with respect to our acquisition to competition in the market. And the other is related to trade. And so, the two matters are just different. And in our particular case, we bring so much value to the marketplace in China. I mean I'm confident that the market will see that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess a question on the non-cloud part of your datacenter business. If you think about the trends you're seeing in enterprise virtualization and HPC and all the work you're doing around RAPIDS, rendering et cetera. Can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business, I think that's roughly 50% of the mix, so is at a piece that you feel confident can grow in 2019 and any color around that would be appreciated.\nJen-Hsun Huang: We expected to grow in 2019. A lot of our T4 inference work is related to what people call edge computing and it has to be done at the edge because the amount of data that otherwise would be transferred to the cloud is just too much, has to be done at the edge because of data sovereignty issues and data privacy issues. And it has to be done at the edge because the latency requirement is really, really high. It has to respond basically like a reflex and to make a prediction or make a suggestion or stop the piece of machinery instantaneously. And so a lot of that work that we're doing in T4 inference is partly in the cloud, a lot of it is at the edge. T4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess about halfway through the quarter and the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics -- predictive data analytics is quite large. And the size of the data is growing so significantly and with Moore's Law ending, it's really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so, we've been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware and it's called RAPIDS and I appreciate you saying that. And that's being put together in the activity and get hub is just fantastic. As you can see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions because they would like to be able to take that open source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so, I expect the enterprise side of our business both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing to be a really good growth driver for us this year.\nC.J. Muse: As a follow up, real quickly on auto. It's a business that you've talked about more R&D focus. But clearly, I think it surprised positively, what's the visibility like there and how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Our Automotive Strategy has several components. There's the engineering component of it where we -- our engineers and their engineers have to co-develop the autonomous vehicles. And then there's three other components; there's the component of AI computing infrastructure, we call DGX and or any of the OEM servers that include our GPUs that are used for developing the AIs. The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test card. And all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center. And so, we have an infrastructure of what we call DGX that people could use. And so, we're seeing a lot of success there. We just announced this last quarter a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center. And they're all going through a pseudo directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios and we call that Constellation. And then, lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car and we call that drive. And so, these are these are the four components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We're doing great in China. There's a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created, the robot taxis developments around the world largely using NVIDIA technology. We recently announced a partnership with Toyota. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're working on. I'm anxious to announce them to you. But this is an area that that -- is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection delivery drones are all basically use essentially the same technique. And so, this is the this is the foundational work that we do for a larger space that people call the intelligent as your computing at the edge.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year, is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you'd expected given the shortage or is it more just about unit volume. And then, just following up on that. What's your level of confidence and that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?\nJen-Hsun Huang: In Q2, we were -- we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It's improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so, the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly and that's affected our initial ramp. We don't expect it to affect our ramp going forward. And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU which is super energy efficient, in combination made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799 thin and really delightful all the way up to something incredible with a RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use. And the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had -- I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some hundred notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so, I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It's the fastest growing segment. It is very largely under penetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn't really possible to design a notebook that is both great and performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own. And so finally, we've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and create a powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that's really wonderful to own and carry around. And so, this is going to be a really -- this is a fast-growing segment and all the OEMs know it and that's why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes and we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks gaming PCs ramping right now.\nChris Caso: It's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. We've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility and I guess the question is, when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue is next year the year. And then, what would be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution. I presume some at level two plus things you've been talking about would probably most likely there given the amount of volume there, if you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Level 2+ call it 2020, late 2021 or 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019 very, very early for robot taxis, next year substantially more volume for robot taxis 2021 bigger volumes for robot taxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robot taxi because of sensor resolution's, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm all of it put together it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation and so the economics would reflect that. And so that robot taxi is kind of like next year, year after ramp and then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022. Overall, remember that our economics come from four different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it. There's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation, and then the economics of the car. And so, we just announced Constellation, the enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation.\nOperator: And the next question comes from line of Matt Ramsay with Cowan.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I have two questions, one for Jen-Hsun and one for Colette. I guess Jen-Hsun you've done, you said in many forums that move down to the new process noted 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach and I agree with that. But, maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around 7-nanometer franchising in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program? And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least the anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here. And secondly, Colette maybe you could talk us through your expectations. I understand there's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue that maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility. Thank you.\nJen-Hsun Huang: The entire reason for Q4 and Q1 is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency, has nothing to do with Turing in fact. Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was. And it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was. And so, the pause in gaming is now behind us, we're on a growth trajectory with gaming, RTX has took the lead on Ray tracing and is now going to become the standard for next generation gaming support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet. And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented and the last couple of quarters have also intersected with overlapped with the seasonal slowdown that -- not so, but build that the seasonal builds of the Nintendo switch and we're going to go back to normal build cycle. And as Colette said earlier somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we'll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we're off to a great start in Turing and I'm super excited about that. And then, in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom, our Turing architecture spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so, I think we're in pretty good shape. In terms of process notes we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists and it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our current GPUs. And so that the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those two things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.\nColette Kress: And to the second question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year. We're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with the year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in a high single digit. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there. But our year-over-year growth start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this past year. But, I do believe we're on track to meet that goal.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun for any closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks everyone. We're glad to be returning to growth. We are focused on driving three growth strategies. First, RTX ray tracing. It's now clear that ray tracing is the future of gaming and digital design. And NVIDIA RTX is leading the way with the support of Microsoft DXR, Epic, Unity, Adobe and Autodesk. Game publishers like EA, movie studios like Pixar, industry support has been fantastic. Second, accelerated computing and AI computing, the pause in hyperscale spending will pass. Accelerated computing and AI are the greatest forces in computing today and NVIDIA is leading these movements. Whether cloud or enterprise or AI at the edge for 5G or industries NVIDIA is one scalable architecture from cloud to edge is a focal point platform for the industry to build AI upon. Third robotics, some call it embedded AI, some edge AI or autonomous machines. The same computing architecture is used for self-driving cars, pick and place robotics arms, delivery drones and smart retail stores. Every machine that move or machines that watch other things that move whether with driver or driverless will have robotics and AI capabilities. Our strategy is to create an end-to-end platform that spans NVIDIA's DGX AI computing infrastructure to NVIDIA Constellation simulation to NVIDIA AGX embedded AI computing. And finally, we're super excited about the pending acquisition of Mellonox. Together we can advance cloud and edge architectures for HPC and AI computing. See you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter with revenue exceeding $5 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 61%. Full-year revenue was also a record at $16.7 billion, up 53%. Our Gaming business have reached record revenue of $2.5 billion in Q4, up 10% sequentially, and up 67% from a year earlier. Full-year gaming revenue was a record at $7.8 billion, up 41%. Demand is incredible for our new GeForce RTX 30 Series products based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In early December, we launched the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, which joined the previously launched RTX 3090, 3080, and 3070. The entire 30 Series lineup has been hard to keep in stock and we exited Q4 with channel inventories even lower than when we started. Although we are increasing supply, channel inventories will likely remain low throughout Q1. GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards were a holiday sensation do not just do their amazing performance, but also to the rich features, including our second-generation RTX ray tracing technologies and DLSS, AI-powered performance accelerator, which massively boost frame rates in graphically demanding titles. Three dozen games now all support RTX, including the top Battle Royale game, Fortnite; the top role-playing game, Cyberpunk 2077; the top massively multiplayer online game, World of Warcraft; and the best-selling game of all time, Minecraft. RTX has clearly set the new standard in gaming. Building on this momentum at CES in January, we introduced a wave of Ampere architecture gaming products, including our biggest ever laptop launch powered by GeForce RTX 3060, 3070, and 3080 laptop GPUs and with our third-generation Max-Q technology. These new thin and lightweight gaming laptops increased performance and energy efficiency by up to 2x from the prior generation. RTX 3060 laptops start $999 and are faster than the previous generation laptops, which sold for $2,500. The incredible performance, design and price points of these new laptops will delight the growing universe of gamers and creators as well as students and professionals. The gaming laptop market has grown seven-fold in the past seven years and momentum is building. With top OEMs bringing to market a record 70-plus laptop models based on the GeForce RTX 30 series. GeForce laptops as a whole are the fastest-growing and one of the largest gaming platforms. Also at CES, we announced the GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, priced at $329, extending the 30 series desktop liner further into the mainstream. We expect strong demand when it launches this Friday as 60-class GPUs have traditionally been our most popular products. Starting with the 3060, we're taking an important step to maximize the supply of GeForce GPUs for gamers. Users are constantly discovering new applications for our powerful programmable GPUs and cryptocurrency mining is one of them. With rising Ethereum prices, there are indications that minors are behind GPUs. We would like GeForce GPUs to end up with gamers. So we have created a new special software drivers that will detect the Ethereum mining algorithm cutting in half the mining efficiency of the GeForce RTX 3060. We suspect the significant increase in the Ethereum network hash rate observed over the past few months was driven by a combination of previously installed mining capacities that was reactivated as well as new sales of GPUs and ASICs. Since our GPUs are sold to graphics card manufacturers and then onto distribution, we don't have the ability to accurately track or quantify their end use. Analyst estimate suggest that cryptomining contributed 100 million to 300 million to our Q4 revenue, a relatively small portion of our gaming revenue in Q4. Cryptocurrencies have recently started to be accepted by companies and financial institutions and show increased signs of staying power to address industrial Ethereum mining demand, last week we announced a new line of NVIDIA CMPs or cryptomining processors. Shipments will start in March. CMPs lack display outputs and have other optimizations that improve cryptomining power efficiency. CMP products will let us gain some visibility into the contribution of cryptomining to our overall revenue. For Q1, we estimate that CMP will contribute approximately 15 million. We plan to sell these products to industrial miners. We will quantify their contribution each quarter for transparency. Over the past year, it has become clear that we've entered a new era in which gaming is an integral part of global culture. The number of concurrent users on Steam has more than doubled since 2018 and continues to hit new records. In 2020 alone, more than 100 billion hours of gaming content was seen on YouTube and 0.5 billion people watched e-sports. Increasingly, we aren't just gaming. We're also watching sports, attending concerts, creating content and connecting with our friends in virtual environments. Additionally, we are excited about the new experiences like VR. Significantly more content is now available, including arguably the first VR killer app, Beat Saber, and there is now almost 2 million VR users on Steam. And with these powerful structural shifts, we expect our gaming business to remain on a robust growth trajectory. The GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs have kicked off a powerful upgrade cycle and we estimate only around 15% of GeForce gamers on an RTX cost GPU, which is needed to experience the beautiful ray trace graphics of modern games. Moreover, the universe of gamers is rapidly expanding and the reach of GeForce has extended beyond gamers to some 45 million creators. In addition, gaming revenue continues to benefit from a favorable mix shift as gamers and creators keep moving to higher-end GPUs, we expect another great year for GeForce. Earlier this month, we celebrated the one year anniversary of the GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform, which is now over 6 million members strong. GeForce now offers 800 PCs from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud gaming service including any of the most played free to play games, starting with support for windows PCs, Macs, and Android devices we added support in recent months to Chromebooks, iPhones and iPads. GFN has grown globally with more than 65 countries on our service and more \u2013 added regularly by our GeForce NOW alliance partners. Moving to Pro Vis, Q4 revenue was $307 million, up 30% sequentially and down 10% year-on-year and ahead of our expectations full-year revenue was $1.1 billion was down 13%. Strong sequential growth was driven primarily by a recovery in desktop workstations as some customers returned to the office and enterprises resumed purchases that had been deferred by the pandemic. Notebook GPUs grew sequentially to a record as enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Looking ahead, the reopening of businesses will benefit desktop workstations, but longer-term workforce trends will likely shift our mix to notebook GPUs and cloud offerings. Healthcare was a standout vertical in the quarter with significant orders from GE Siemens and Oxford Nanopore technologies, public sector and automotive also so strength. Omniverse are real time 3D collaboration and simulation platform is now an open beta. Over 500 creators and professionals have tested Omniverse through our early access program. Omniverse is one of our most important and exciting platforms. We are divided by its initial acceptance and look forward to sharing more details on its long-term growth opportunity in the coming months. Moving to Automotive; Q4 revenue was $145 million, up 16% sequentially and down 11% year-on-year. Full-year revenue of $536 million, declined 23%. Sequential growth was driven by continued recovering in the global automotive production volumes and growth in AI cockpit revenue. Year-on-year decline reflects the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment. Nvidia has emerged as the industry's leading end-to-end full stack technology provider for self-driving and AI enabled vehicles or in the SOC that drive self-driving platform is built on delivers an unrivaled 254 trillions of operations per second of performance on industry leading power efficiency, helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. Our technology leadership has driven a robust rapidly growing set of opportunities. We have great momentum with an expanding list of electric vehicle OEMs, including NIO, SAIC, Li Auto and Xpeng which are all using the Nvidia drive platform to power their next generation of vehicles. We look forward to growing with them as they continue to scale. Our software defined platforms is the only solution that spans from the data center for training deep neural net and running physically accurate simulations to a full stack in car solutions scaling for ADAS to Level 5 fully autonomous functionality. Autonomous vehicle companies are harnessing this technology. Zoox recently unveiled its Level 5 bi-directional robotaxi powered by Nvidia, and wide launched its next generation countless autonomous truck using NVIDIA Drive Orin. And earlier this year, Mercedes announced a 56-inch wide MBUX Hyperscreen powered by Nvidia AI cockpit technology. This will builds on our momentum with Mercedes first-generation MBUX system, which is now in 1.8 million cars. We are in the early innings of a significant opportunity. We have built a multi-billion dollar design win pipeline for our self-driving the AI cockpit solutions, which will drive a material inflection in revenue over the next few years. Our transformational partnership with Mercedes announced last June demonstrates the power of our evolving business model as we expand our addressable market and layer in software revenue. We are exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity that lies ahead. Moving to data center; revenue was $1.9 billion, which exceeded our expectations was comparable to last quarter and up 97% from the year ago period, which did not include Mellanox. Data center compute revenue was up 45% year-on-year. Full-year data center revenue rose 125% to a record $6.7 billion, including almost 70% growth from data center compute. From a sequential perspective, the data center computes stronger than expected double-digit growth more than offset the anticipated decline in Mellanox revenue, which included a large non-reoccurring network sale to a single OEM in Q3. Compute growth was lead by vertical industries where OEM partners continued ramping up their 100 \u2013 day 100 base servers and our own DGX system sales were strong. Vertical industries were well over 50% of data center revenue across compute and networking with particular strength in super computing, financial services, higher education and consumer internet verticals. Additionally, hyperscale customers continued to deploy the A100 driving both sequential growth and exceptionally strong year-on-year growth in data center compute. The A100 has been adopted by all major cloud customers globally and is being deployed by hyperscale customers for internal workloads. Still we are in the early stages of adoption and expect continued growth this year. The ramp of the A100 has been smoother and accomplished by better visibility than prior generation. It's universal AI training and inference capabilities as well as support for wider set of applications and outstanding performance are driving five customer utilization; a clear sign of the A100's value. Turning to Mellanox. We are seeing continued strong traction and robust momentum across our customer set. Its revenue was up over 30% from Mellanox's Q4 revenue in calendar 2019 when it was still a standalone company. Year-on-year growth in the quarter was led by hyperscale and large consumer internet customers, which grew over 60% from last year with several contributing record revenues. Consistent with our outlook Mellanox had a sequential decline impacted by a non-reoccurring sales to a China OEM in Q3. We expect to return to sequential growth in Q1 driven by strong demand for our high speed networking products, including the ramp of ConnectX adapters with CSPs and all major server OEMs in their upcoming refresh. We also see strong momentum in high-performance computing with HDR InfiniBand products. For example, we won six of the seven supercomputers awarded over the past few months by Euro HPC. Starting next quarter, we will continue to provide color on networking as part of the data center market platform, but we will no longer break out Mellanox revenue separately. Looking forward, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities and data center. Accelerated computing is not only delivering super more loss, gains and performance but there's also an energy efficient and cost effective method of computing and virtually every industry is adopting technology with greater urgency as companies adapt to the new world of more distributed workers and customers. As industries embark on this journey, they are also increasingly focused on combating climate change. To that end, the A100 performed AI computations with one-twentieth the power consumption of CPU's. And powers are saline supercomputer, which is number one on the Green500 list of the world's most efficient supercomputers. Indeed Nvidia's powered machines recently captured 25 of the top 30 spots on the Green500 list. Accelerated computing is not only serving the exponential growth and demand for compute; it can also help bend the power consumption curve. With accelerated computing Nvidia is pioneering a [indiscernible] forward the computing industry. Before I moved to the P&L and outlook, let me give you an update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. In September, we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank Group and a transaction that will create the premier computing company for the age of AI. At that time, we said it would take approximately 18 months to secure regulatory approvals in the U.S., the UK, the EU, China and other jurisdictions. Thorough reviews are typical with the deal of this size. This process is moving forward as expected. We are in constructive dialogue with the relevant authorities and are confident that regulators will see the benefits to the entire tech ecosystem. As we have said, this combination will spur competition together Arm and Nvidia will provide greater choice to the data center ecosystem, a compelling alternative CPU architecture for the market and further enhance Arms' offering in mobile and embedded. Our intention is to increase investment in Arm's existing roadmap, adding resources to stimulate growth in new markets. We love and intent to maintain Arm's open licensing model, a commitment guaranteed both by long-term legally binding contracts, as well as our own interest in ensuring this investment is a profitable one for us. We are on the cusp of new age in which AI fuels industries ranging from healthcare to scientific research to the environment. With this transaction, our vision is to boost Arm's potential, so it can thrive in this new era and grow into promising new markets. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins were 63.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 65.5%. GAAP gross margins declined year-on-year due to amortization of developed technology acquired from Mellanox, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was due to higher margins for gaming GPU and lower IP related costs, partially offset by lower margin mix in our data center portfolio. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 10 basis points year-on-year and was flat sequentially in-line with our expectations. Q4 GAAP EPS was $2.31, up 51% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.10, up 64% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was a record $2.07 billion. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue is expected to be $5.3 billion plus or minus 2% with most of the sequential growth driven by gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.8% and 66% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.67 billion, and $1.2 billion respectively. For the full-year we expect to grow non-GAAP OPEX in the mid-20% range. GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an extent of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending to Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference on March 1st. The Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 3rd; and the Arete Virtual Semis Conference on March 3rd. In addition, we will be hosting a virtual Investor Day on Monday, April 12th following a live stream of Jensen's opening keynote at our GPU Technology Conference. Our earnings call to discuss our first quarter and full \u2013 our first quarter is scheduled for Wednesday, May 26. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, higher-level question for you on the enterprise side. You're now a couple of quarters into the ramp of A100.And curious if you could speak to whether you've seen any surprises here, any areas of specific strength worth calling out? And any changes to how you're thinking about the size of this opportunity?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot. It's Jensen. As you know, A100 is a very different type of GPU. This is our first universal computing GPU. It's great at high-performance computing. It's great at data analytics. It's great at training. And also for our highest GPU, it\u2019s also the first time that is incredible for imprint. It's some 20 times faster than previous generation. We may introduce this some really exciting new computational formats like TF32, TensorFloat-32 for training. And with a multi-instance GPU, turning our GPU 1, GPU to a whole bunch of smaller GPUs, autonomous GPU to improve performance and reducing latency. And so the capability is really quite exciting. We're seeing strength in hyperscalers as they continue to accelerate their adoption of AI. Some of the new applications we've spoken about a couple of times before, the transition to deep learning, the conversational AI, speech recognition to natural language understanding all the way to speech synthesis, which is now based on AI \u2013 based on deep learning. The other area that's growing incredibly fast is the deep learning recommender models. Just about everything that you do on the Internet is based on recommenders. There are hundreds of different recommenders out there, whether you're shopping or recommending music or recommending news or recommending search, and so all the recommending ads. And so all of these different types of applications are driving that. For the first time, we saw our industrial application - industrial data center growing to be larger than hyperscale. And we're seeing industrial applications across scientific computing where simulation-based approaches are now being fused with AI approaches for weather simulation, genomics, molecular dynamics simulation, quantum chemistry, even simulating quantum computing, which is one of the really exciting areas. We're seeing AI being deployed for big data analytics, RAPIDS, which is NVIDIA\u2019s created open source platform for data analytics of Spark 3.0, which NVIDIA really led and is now GPU accelerated. So now you could have big data in the cloud, while doing big data analytics in the cloud on all of the CSP platforms. You could \u2013 we're seeing a lot of excitement around financial services and consumer Internet services are all really growing nicely. And so A100 adoption is just starting. I mean, we're going to see several \u2013 couple of years of continued growth ahead of us, while as AI gets adopted in clouds and industries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification and then a question for Jensen. On the clarification, Colette, I was hoping if you could give a little more color around Q1? Do you still expect data center to grow sequentially in Q1? I know you said that most of the growth will come from gaming, but any color on the data center would be useful? And then, Jensen, the question for you is, in your press release you used the phrase AI driving the smartphone moment for every industry. Could you help us quantify what that means? And where I'm going with that is, is there a number in terms of what percentage of servers are shipping today with your accelerators? And where can that ratio go over time? Is that a fair way of looking at the adoption of your technology and AI?\nColette Kress: So thank you, Vivek. Your question regarding the guidance as we beat into Q1. We had indicated that, yes, a good percentage of our growth between Q4 and Q1 those come from gaming, but we also do expect data center to grow. Most of our sequential growth coming from gaming, but keep in mind, we also expect all of our market platforms will likely be able to grow quarter-over-quarter.\nJensen Huang: Because we are entering in the third phase of AI. The first phase of AI was when we invented the computing platforms, the new chips, the new systems, the new system software, the new middleware, the new way of working, the new way of developing software, which the industry, the world is now starting to call ML Ops. The way that software is developed and the way that is deployed is completely different in the past. In fact, I heard a great term Software 2.0, and it makes a lot of sense. It's a computer that is writing software. The way that you develop software is completely different; the way you compute is different. And that was our first phase, and that that started in a journey that was some eight, nine years ago now. The second phase was the adoption of using this in an industrial way for clouds. And we saw it revolutionize new services; whether it's speech-oriented services or search-oriented services, recommended services, the way you shop, the way you use the Internet is completely different today. And so that's really the second phase and those two phases are still continuing to grow, and you're still seeing the growth associated with that. The third phase is the industrialization of AI. And some of the great examples when I say in terms of smartphone moment, I meant that it's a device with AI, it\u2019s autonomous and it's connected to a cloud service, and it's continuously learning. So some of the exciting example that I saw, that I've seen and we're working with companies all over the world, we have some 7,000 AI startups that we're working with, and almost all of them are developing something like this. And large industrial companies whether it's John Deere or Walmart, they're all developing application kind of like this. And basically it's an autonomous system, autonomous machine. In our case it's called Jetson. It's a robotics machine. That robotics machine is a car and it\u2019s called DRIVE. And it's running an autonomous - an AI application on top and AI is still on top, and this could be \u2013 they could be moving device \u2013 moving things around, it can be picking and placing. It could be just watching a warehouse and monitoring traffic and keeping traffic flow going. It could be connected to a car. And whenever the car \u2013 whenever the fleet of cars needs to be retrained because of a new circumstance that was discovered, the cloud service would do the relearning and then we\u2019d deploy into all of the autonomous devices. And so in the future, we're seeing these industries, whether you're in retail or in logistics or transportation, or farming, ag tech to lawnmowers \u2013 consumer lawnmowers. They're not going to just be products that you buy and use from that point forward, but it likely be a connected device with an AI service that runs on top of it. And so these industries I'm so excited about because it gives an opportunity to change the way that they interact with their customers. Rather than selling something once, they sell something and provide service that's on top of it. And they can stay engaged with the customers. The customers could get a product that's improving all of the time, just like your smartphone. And that's kind of like \u2013 that's kind of the reason \u2013 that's the reason why I've been calling it a smartphone moment for all these industry. And we saw what happened to the smartphone revolution. And then we saw what happened to the smart microphone, the smart speaker revolution, and you're going to see smart lawnmowers, smart tractors, smart air conditioners, smart elevators, smart building, smart warehouses, robotic retail storage and entire store \u2013 the entire retail store is like a robot. And they will all have autonomous capability that are being driven by AI. And so what\u2019s new for the industry therefore. Is that all if the enterprises in the world use to have computers for IT to facilitate our employees and their supply chain. But in the future, all of these industries whether in medical imaging or lawnmowers, you're going to have data centers that are hosting your products just like the CSP. And so that's a brand new industry and we have a platform that we call EGX, which is the 5G Edge AI systems. And we have the autonomous systems we call AGX, which is what goes into adjusting and drives. And between those two systems and the software stack that we have on top of it we're in a great position to help these industries one at a time transformed their business model from a object oriented business model, a thing based business model to a connected device.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, I don't want to be pedantic, I suppose, but I guess on the Q1 guide, you say the gaming is the majority of the growth. Was that an absolute statement or was that a percentage statement? Can you give us some idea of how you'd sort of rank the sequential percentage growth of say gaming versus data center versus other, especially since it sounds like you've got 50 OEMs in crypto specific stuff that will go into the other? And then I guess just briefly, could you give us some indication of where your supply situation and lead times are on your ampere parts within data center? I think you'd said last quarter, they were many months on six months plus, are they still looking like that? And is that sort of a limiting factor at this point in terms of what you can actually ship on the compute side and data center?\nJensen Huang: Colette, you will take one and I'll take the one.\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me start off Stacy in terms of our guidance for Q1, as you know, we're still in the early innings of our Ampere Architecture. Our Ampere Architecture, as it relates to gaming, as well as what it relates to data center. As we articulated in our call we have been really seeing continued uplift of folks adoption of A100 and it's going quite smoothly than what we had seen in prior overall versions. So when we think about our guidance for Q1, there's many different types of conclusions that will happen at the end of the quarter in terms of what we should put all of our platforms can grow. But the majority of the majority of the growth from Q4 to Q1 will likely be gaming.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. You asked the question about normal time, our company \u2013 at the company level where supply constraint, our demand is greater than our supply. And however for data center, so long as the customers more closely with us, and we do a good job planning between my companies, there should be a supply issue for data center. We just had to do a good job planning and we have direct relationships with each one of the royalty of fees and we have direct relationships with all the young ones. And we could do excellent planning between us.  We shouldn't have a supplier. We shouldn't be supply constrained there. But at the company level, we're supply constrained. Demand is greater than supply. And yes, we have enough supply. Yes, we usually have enough supply to achieve that even the outlook. And we had that situation in Q4. We expect that situation in Q1. And we have enough supply to grow through the year. But supply against constraint and demand is really, really great.  And so we just have to do a really good job planning. And meanwhile, one of the things that, that really came through for us is we have the world's best operations team. Our company is really, really have had an amazing operations team. We build the most complex products in the world, the most complex chips, the most complex packages, the most complex systems. And during Q4, they improved our cycle time and during Q1 we expecting them to improve our cycle time again. And we really are blessed to have such an amazing operations team.  And so during these times it really comes in handy. But overall at the company level where we expected them to be greater than supply, we have enough supply to do better in the outlook. And we have enough supply to grow each quarter throughout the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. \nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I had a question on crypto, I guess Jensen, I know that the CMP stuff and the software drivers stuff that you're doing for the 36. And that's going to help a lot, but I think there is like four or five the big currency was in a move or at least a moving or there on a faster move from a proof of work to proof of stake, which is going to be a lot less compute intensive. So I guess the question that I get a lot is how do you assess the degree to which that drives GPUs back into the secondary market? Is there any way to get treated, get kind of a handle on that? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. If you look at the recent cash rates first of all, the transitions is going to takes some time. It can't happen overnight. And people have to build trust in all of the new versions. And so they'll take a little bit of time, but I hope it does. I hope that people use our proof of stake over time. And a little bit of these questions don't have to be answered. However I don\u2019t have the optimism either that it will be all proof of stake, I think that proof of work is a very legitimate way of securing the currency.  And in the beginning while any currency is building its reputation, then take something like a group of work to do so. And so I think proof of work is going to be around for a bit. We developed CMP for this very reason, just so that there are different versions. We have different versions of our products for gaming, for professional visualization, for high performance computing, for deep learning. It stands to reasoning that you have to do a different version for CMP and we can solve it directly the way that we go-to-market would be to go directly to the industrial miners to \u2013 and it\u2019s a great benefit to them. So they don\u2019t have to chasing around spot markets. It\u2019s a great benefit to the gamers. And because they want a game, and the game demand is just probably is off a chart. And so this is visibility really beneficial to everybody. The recent hash rate growth was really a result of several dynamics. The first dynamic is the install base. Most people thought that the \u2013 once the mining \u2013 the GPUs come back into the aftermarket, a small part does that, some people do that, but the vast majority don't keep them. And the reason for that is because obviously they believe in Ethereum and so \u2013 they're industrial miners that's what they do. And so, they're keeping around for when the profitability returns and they could kick start the mining gear. We saw \u2013 that's what we saw in the latter part of last year. We saw the hash rates starting to grow. Most of that was result of the installed miners reactivating their equipment. It wasn't until earlier this year that we started to see a demand in our own GPUs. And when that starts to happen, there are some different dynamics. There's \u2013 the primary source these days come from powerful ASICs. And then there's some that that comes from our GPU and other GPUs in the marketplace. And so, I think that this is going to be a part of our business. It won't grow extremely large, no matter what happens. And the reason for that is because when it starts to grow large more ASICs comes into market, which kind of needs it. And when the market becomes smaller, it's harder for ASICs to sustain the R&D. And so the spot miners, industrial miners come back. And then we'll create CMPs. And so, we expect that to be kind of a \u2013 to be a small part of our business as we go forward. Now, one of the important things is to realize that in the near-term, the \u2013 because we're in the beginning parts of our Ampere ramp, only two quarters into a multi-year cycle. This is also the first time that we've completely changed computer graphics. RTX using ray tracing is completely different than virtualization. And so this is a fundamental change in the way we do computer graphics and the results have been spectacular. There are some 200 million install base in desktops and 50 million in laptop. And the vast majority of them, we've only upgraded approximately I think it's something like 50% of the install base has been upgraded to RTX. And so there is a giant install base and the install base is growing that we need to upgrade to the next generation of computer graphics.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, guys. Thanks for letting me to ask questions. I want to go back to data center. You've been very kind over the last couple of quarters to call out Mellanox both when it was a positive driver and when it was a headwind. I'm kind of curious as you do \u2013 when you look into the fiscal first quarter, is there anything of distinction to mention around Mellanox versus core data center? And I guess as a follow on, the key metric that a lot of investors were looking at is when does the core data center business year-over-year growth starts to reaccelerate? And some of that is just simple math where you're just comping very hard compares from last year. But Jensen how would you think about data center year-over-year growth in the context of a reopening trade or any sort of new applications out there? I mean, what happened \u2013 what helped last time around was the move to natural language AI. Is there another big sort of AI application we should be thinking about as we think about data center growth reaccelerating?\nJensen Huang: We're expecting \u2013 Mellanox was down this last quarter. And our compute business grew double digit and offset \u2013 more than offsets the decline in Mellanox. We expect Q1 to be a growth quarter to Mellanox and we expect this coming year to be quite an exciting year of growth for Mellanox. The business is growing and ethernet is growing for CSPs is growing in InfiniBand for high performance computing and the Switch \u2013 the Switches have grown. Switch business grew 50% year-over-year. And so, we're seeing really terrific growth there. One of the new initiatives and we're going to see success towards the second half because the number of adoptions, the number of engagements has grown as our BlueField DPUs. It's used for virtualization for hyperscalers. It's also used for security. As you know quite well the future of computing and cloud and it's multi-tenant cloud and there's no VPN front door to the cloud. You've got millions of people who are using every aspect of computing. So you need to have distributed firewalls and you can't have it just in one place. The intense focus of security across all of the data centers around the world is really creating a great condition for BlueField, which is really perfect then. And so, I expect our Mellanox networking business to grow very nicely this year. And we expect Q1 to be a great growth quarter for compute as well as Mellanox. The Killer, great driving application for AI are several \u2013 last year you're absolutely right that it with natural language understanding and the transformer model and what is the \u2013 what was the core of \u2013 and other versions like that really, really made it possible for us to enable all kinds of new applications. So you're going to see a natural language understanding do text completion, and it's going to be integrated \u2013 I think it was just announced today that it was going to be integrated into Microsoft Word, and we've been working with them on that for some time. And so there are some really exciting applications out there, but the new ones that came \u2013 that emerged recently are deep learning based conversational AI, where the ASR, the speech recognition as well as the speech synthesis are now based on deep learning, it wasn't before. And they were based on models that ran on CPUs, but now with these deep learning models, the accuracy is much, much higher and it has the ability to also mimic your voice and be a lot more natural. And so, the ability \u2013 these models are much more complex and much larger. The other big huge driver is the recommenders. This is something really worthwhile to take a look at is called deep learning recommender models, and recommenders have historically \u2013 whether it's for shopping and or personalizing websites are personalizing your store, recommending your basket, recommending your music. Historically, it's been \u2013 and use the traditional machine learning algorithms, but because of the accuracy and \u2013 just the extraordinary economic impact that comes from an incremental 1% in accuracy for most of the \u2013 mostly the world's large internet businesses people are moving very rapidly to deep learning based models. And these models are gigantic. They're utterly gigantic. And this is an area that is really driving high-performance computers. And \u2013 so we \u2013 I expect us to see a lot of momentum there. And the last one is the one that I just spoken out, which has to do with industrial 5G and edge, IoT type of applications for all of the different industries whether it's retail or logistics or transportation, agriculture or warehouses to factories. And so, we're going to see AI and robotics in a very large number of applications in industries and we're just seeing so much excitement there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back again on the data center business that you just mentioned, Jensen, that the BlueField-2 product poised to kind of ramp and materialize in the back half of the calendar year. How do you see that \u2013 is it an attach rate? I think there has been discussions in the past about \u2013 all servers could potentially over time incorporate this layer of acceleration. How quickly should we think about that ramp? And then the second question is, can you just at a high level talk about how CPU \u2013 how a CPU strategy you're thinking about that in the context of the broader data center market?\nJensen Huang: Sure. If I could just work backwards, I believe that every single data center node will be outfitted with a GPU someday. And that someday is probably call it five years from now. And the fundamental driver of it is going to be security. Every single application in the data center and every single node in the data center has to be individually secured, zero trust computing, zero or confidential computing or zero trust computing. These initiatives are going to cause every data center to have every single application and every single node would be secured, which means every one of those computers have to have a control plane that is isolated from the application plane. And all the applications cannot share the same resources because that application could be malware, that application could be an intruder. No application could have access to the control plan. And yet today the software defined data centers, the software defined networking, software defined storage, all of the security agents are running in the same processors as the applications and that hasn't changed. You're seeing the cloud \u2013 the CSPs in the world moving in this direction. Every single data center will have to move in that direction. So every node will be a DPU process for the software, for the infrastructure. You're essentially going to see the data center infrastructure would be offloaded from the application point and it will be something like a Bluefield. So I think this is our next multi-billion dollar opportunity, CPS. We support every CPU in the world. And we're the only accelerated computing platform that accelerates every CPU. Ironically, the only CPU that we don't accelerate for AI is ARM, but we want to change them. ARM has such an exciting future because the nature of their business model and the nature of their architecture is perfect for the future of hyperscalers and data centers. You wanted \u2013 you want the most energy efficiency and in every single data center, because every data center is power constrained. We are going to be power constrained in every aspect of computing going forward. And so we would love to build around the own processor and invest in building a great ecosystem around it. And so that all the world's peripherals and all the world's applications can work and \u2013 work on any one of the CPUs that we know today. And I want to start \u2013 we're going to start with high-performance computing and start with \u2013 all the areas that we have a lot of expertise in to build out our platform. And so, you're starting to see one industry leader after another embraced on and I think that's terrific, but now we've got to energize it with all of the ecosystem support. It can't just be on vertical applications, but we want to create a broad general ARM ecosystem.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMark Lipacis: Hi, thanks for taking my question. A question for Jensen, I think. Jensen, if you look at the past computing eras, typically it's one ecosystem that that captures 80% of the value of that computing era and mainframes as IBM and many computers with stack PCs, Wintel, cell phones, Nokia and then Apple. So, if you don't get the ecosystem right then you're splitting 20% of the market with a handful of players. So in this next era of computing parallel processing or AI, I think you've articulated the most compelling architectural vision of the data center of the future with data center scale computing devices with CPUs, GPUs, DPUs integrating to the same box serving all workloads in machine virtualized environment. Can you help us understand where is the market in embracing that vision and where is NVIDIA in building out that the ecosystem for that data center scale competing vision. And then maybe as part of that to what extent is CUDA of the kernel for that ecosystem? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, we're \u2013 I think we've done a great job on building out the platforms for several ecosystems around the world. And the domain that we do incredibly well out on \u2013 the domains that I have to do with accelerated computing, we pioneered this approach. And we brought it to high-performance computing at first and we accelerated scientific computing and we democratized supercomputing for all researchers, anybody who wants to have a supercomputer now can. And computing, it will simply not be the obstacle that somebody's discovery. We did the same for artificial intelligence. We did the same for visualization. We brought \u2013 we expanded the nature of gaining tremendously. Our GeForce today is the largest gaming platform. It\u2019s the largest single largest body of computers that are used for gaming. And in each case, we expanded the market tremendously. We would like to do the same for data center scale computing, as it applies to virtualizing these applications, these applications are also in the process. They've historically required dedicated systems, but they're moving into a virtualized data center environment.  And we are best at doing that. They run on our platform today. We have the ability to virtualize it and put it into the data center and make it remotely available. And so these applications, these domains are some of the most important domains in the world. And so we're in the process of getting them. By doing so and making our architecture available to CSPs and OEMs, we could create this accelerated computing platform available to everybody. And so that's we're seeing our journey doing them. First, creating an architecting this platform, and then putting it literally into every single data center in the world. But we would also like to the next step of our journey is there's the Phase 3 of AI and has to do about \u2013 it has to do with turning every end point into a data center, whether it's a 5G tower, a warehouse or retail store, a self-driving car, a self-driving truck, these are going to be \u2013 they're all going to be essentially autonomous data centers and/or they're going to run AI, but they're going to run a lot more. They're going to do security in real time. Its networking is going to be incredible. It's going to run software to 5G and GPO accelerating 5G, we call areal. And so these platforms are going to become data centers. There'll be secure. The software is protected and we can't tamper with. It if you tamper with it, of course won't run. And so the capability of these clouds will move all the way out to the edge. And we're in the best position to be able to do that. So I did the \u2013 in this new world of post close to Moore's law post in arts gaming in this new world where AI and software that writes software in this new world, where data centers are going to be literally everywhere and they're unprotected. There's no giant building with a whole bunch of people that secured. And in this new world where a software is going to enable this autonomous feature, I think we are a perfectly positioned for it.\nOperator: This is all the time we have for Q&A today. I will now turn the call back to CEO, Jensen Huang.\nJensen Huang: Thanks for joining us today. Q4 have the truly breakout year for Nvidia. The two biggest engines of our business gaming and data center posted powerful growth. Gaming has become the world's largest media and entertainment industry, and will grow to be much larger. And again gamers will create, will play, they'll learn, they'll connect. The medium of gaming can host any type of game and eventually evolve with the countless metaverses.  So I'm for placed on for work. Gaming at simultaneously a great technology and a great business driver for our company. This year, we also closed our Mellanox acquisition and successfully united the amazing talent of our companies. Combined we possess deep expertise in all aspects of computing and networking to drive the architecture of modern data centers. Crowd computing and hyperscalers have transformed the data center into the new unit of computing. Chips on servers are just elements of the data center scale computers now. With our expertise in AI computing full stack accelerated computing, our deep network to computing expertise and cloud to edge platforms, Nvidia is helping to drive a great computer industry transformation. And our planned acquisition of Arm, the world's most popular and energy efficient CPU company will help position and video to lead in the age of AI. This year was extraordinary.  The pandemic will pass, but the world has been changed forever. Technology adoption is accelerating across every industry. Companies and products need to be more remote and autonomous. This will drive data centers, AI and robotics. This underlies the accelerated adoption of Nvidia\u2019s technology. The urgency to digitize, automate and accelerate innovation has never been higher. We are ready. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Q3 was another exceptional quarter with record revenue of $4.73 billion, up 57% year-on-year, up 22% sequentially and well above our outlook. Our new NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture is ramping with excellent demand across our major market platforms. Q3 was also a landmark quarter, both for us and the industry as a whole. As we announced plans to acquire Arm from SoftBank for $40 billion, we are incredibly excited about the combined company\u2019s opportunities and we are working through the regulatory approval process. For today, we will focus our remarks on our quarterly performance. Starting with gaming. Revenue was a record $2.27 billion, up 37% year-on-year, up 37% sequentially, and ahead of our high expectations. Driving strong growth was our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GeForce RTX 30 series of gaming GPUs. The GeForce RTX 3070, 3080 and 3090 GPUs offer up to two times the performance and two times the power efficiency over the previous Turing-based generation. Our second generation NVIDIA RTX combines ray tracing and AI to deliver the greatest ever generational leap in performance. First announced on September 1st and ranging in price from $499 to $1,499, these GPUs have generated amazing reviews and overwhelming demand. PC World called them staggeringly powerful, while Newegg cited more traffic than Black Friday. Many of our retail and e-tail partners sold out instantly, the RTX 30 series drove our biggest ever launch. While we had anticipated strong demand, it exceeded even our bullish expectations. Given industry-wide capacity constraints and long cycle times, it may take a few more months for product availability to catch up with demand. In addition to the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture, we announced powerful new tools for gamers as well as for tens of millions of live streamers, broadcasters, eSports professionals, artists and creators. NVIDIA Reflex is a new technology that improves reaction time in games, reducing system latency by up to 58%. NVIDIA Reflex is being integrated into popular eSports games, such as Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite and Valorant. NVIDIA Broadcast is a universal plugin for video conferencing and live streaming applications that enhances the quality of microphones, speakers and webcams with NVIDIA AI effects such as audio noise removal, virtual background effects, and webcam audio frame. With this, remote workers and live streamers can turn any room into a broadcast studio. Blockbuster games continue to adopt NVIDIA\u2019s RTX ray tracing and AI technology. Epic Games announced that Fortnite, which has more than 350 million players worldwide, is adding NVIDIA RTX real-time ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS AI super-resolution and NVIDIA Reflex, making the game more beautiful and even more responsive. Other major new titles featuring RTX this holiday season include Watch Dogs: Legion, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and much anticipated Cyberpunk 2077. Gaming laptop demand was also strong with double-digit year-on-year growth for the 11th quarter in a row. NVIDIA GeForce laptops support the most demanding applications for creators and designers while doubling as a powerful gaming [indiscernible]. We also have record gaming console revenue on strong demand for the Nintendo Switch. And we continue to grow our cloud gaming service, GeForce NOW, which has doubled in the past seven months to reach over 5 million registered users. GeForce NOW is unique as an open platform that connects to popular game stores, including Steam, Epic Games, and Ubisoft Connect, allowing gamers access to the titles they already own. 750 games are currently available on GFN, the most of any cloud gaming platforms, including 75 free to play games, with more games added every Thursday. GFN supports many popular clients, including PCs, Macs and Chromebooks. Stay tuned for more devices to come in the near future. In addition, GFN\u2019s reach continues to expand through our telco partners in a growing list of countries, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. We are also providing technology that enables the cloud gaming services to an expanding number of partners. Following our earlier announcement with Tencent, Amazon and Facebook are beginning to offer cloud gaming services powered by NVIDIA. Moving to ProViz, Q3 revenue was $236 million, down 27% year-on-year and up 16% sequentially, ahead of our expectations. Sequential growth was driven by strength in notebooks, which posted record revenue, boosted by work-from-home initiatives and a shift to thin and light mobile workstations. This is particularly offset by decline in desktop workstations, which continued to be impacted by the pandemic and drove the year-on-year decline. From an industry demand perspective, stronger verticals including healthcare, public sector, higher education and research, and financial services, we continue to win new business in a number of areas. In healthcare, we added Medtronic for visual surgical applications and [indiscernible] for medical imaging. In technology and media and entertainment, we gained wins for design, rendering and broadcast applications. During the quarter, we announced the Omniverse, the world\u2019s first 3D collaboration and simulation platforms has entered open beta. Omniverse enables the tens of millions of designers, architects and creators to collaborate real time, on-premises or remotely. Fusing the virtual and physical worlds, Omniverse brings together NVIDIA breakthroughs in graphics, simulation and AI. It will help enterprises address evolving requirements as workforces become increasingly distributed. Initial market response from this transformative platform has been phenomenal. Over 400 individual creators and developers in diverse industries have been evaluating Omniverse, and early adopters including Ericsson, BMW, Foster and Partners, and Lucasfilm. The pandemic is accelerating development of AR, VR and mixed reality technologies, which will have a profound impact on how we work and play. For example, our work with NASCAR to enable a variety of AR and VR services at the edge is revolutionizing the racing experience for millions of fans across the globe. With our industry-leading real-time ray tracing graphics, AI and simulation hardware and software stacks, NVIDIA is in a unique position to enable the future of blending the physical and virtual worlds. Moving to automotive, Q3 revenue was $125 million, down 23% year-on-year and up 13% sequentially. Sequential growth was driven by a recovery in global automotive production volumes, as well as continued growth in AI cockpit revenue. The year-on-year decline was due to the expected ramp-down of legacy infotainment revenue. In September, Mercedes-Benz debuted its redesign of S-class sedan, featuring an all new NVIDIA powered MBUX AI cockpit system with an augmented reality heads-up display, AI voice assistant, and rich interactive graphics to enable every passenger in the vehicle to enjoy personalized, intelligent features. Also in September, Li Auto, a leading electric car brand in China announced that it will develop its next generation of vehicles using the software defined NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin platform. Orin delivers nearly 7 times the performance and 3 times the energy efficiency of our previous generation SOC, making it uniquely capable to power next generation autonomous electric vehicles. We have excellent traction with EV startups. Finally, last week NVIDIA and Hyundai Motor Group announced that the automaker\u2019s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will come standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems, starting in 2022. This feature-rich software-defined computing platform will allow vehicles to be perpetually upgraded with the latest AI cockpit features. Now moving to data center. Revenue was a record $1.9 billion, up 162% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, driving growth with a strong ramp of our A100-based platforms, continued growth with Mellanox and record T4 shipments for inference. Let me give you a little bit of color on each. Our new NVIDIA Ampere architecture gained further adoption by cloud and hyperscale customers and started ramping into vertical industries. Over the past weeks, Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Alibaba Cloud announced general availability of the A100, following Google Cloud platform and Microsoft Azure. A100 adoption by vertical industries drove strong growth, as we began shipments to server OEM partners whose broad enterprise channels reach a large number of end customers. We also ramped the DGX A100 server and began shipping NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the first turnkey AI infrastructure. These range from 20 to 140 DGX A100 systems interconnected with Mellanox\u2019s HDR InfiniBand networking and enable customers to install incredibly powerful AI supercomputers in just a few weeks\u2019 time. In fact, we have announced plans to build an 80-node DGX SuperPOD with 400 petaflops of AI performance, called Cambridge-1, which will be in the UK\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer. So, it will be used by NVIDIA researchers for collaborative research within the UK\u2019s AI and healthcare community across academia, industry and startups. It joins other systems in NVIDIA\u2019s complex of AI supercomputers powered by our R&D and autonomous vehicles, conversational AI, robotics, graphics, HPC and other domains. This includes Selene, now the world\u2019s fifth fastest supercomputer and fastest commercial supercomputer and a new NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, which ranks first on the Green500 list of the world\u2019s most energy efficient supercomputers. A great example of the tremendous opportunities for AI in healthcare is our new partnership with GSK, for applying computational to the drug and vaccine discovery process. GSK\u2019s London-based AI hub will utilize biomedical data, AI methods, and advanced computing platforms to unlock genetic and clinical data with increased precision and scale. In addition to this investment in NVIDIA\u2019s DGX A100 system, GSK will have access to NVIDIA\u2019s Cambridge-1, the NVIDIA drug discovery software and NVIDIA scientists. In Q3, the A100 swept the industry standard MLPerf benchmark for AI inference performance, following our suite in the prior quarter\u2019s MLPerf benchmark for AI training. Notably, our performance was in AI inference actually extended compared with last year\u2019s benchmark. For example, in the ResNet-50 test for image recognition, our A100 GPU beat CPU-only systems by 30 times this year versus 6 times last year. Additionally, A100 outperformed CPUs by up to 237 times in the newly added recommend data test, which represents some of the most complex and widely used AI models on the internet. Our winning performance in AI inference is translating to continued strong revenue growth. Alongside the continued ramp of the A100, T4 sales set a record as the NVIDIA AI inference adoption is in full throttle. We estimate that NVIDIA installed GPU capacity for inference across the seven largest public clouds now exceeds that of the aggregate CPU capacity in the cloud, testament to the tremendous performance and TCO advantage of our GPUs. Hundreds of companies now operate AI-enabled services on NVIDIA\u2019s inference platforms, including the A100 or T4 GPU, and our Triton, inference serving software. For example, Tencent uses NVIDIA AI inference to recommend video, music, news and apps, supporting billions of queries per day. Microsoft uses NVIDIA AI inference for grammar correction in Microsoft Office, supporting 0.5 trillion queries a year. And American Express uses it for real-time fraud detection. We also gained tremendous traction in supercomputing. We announced that NVIDIA technology, including Ampere architecture GPUs, and HDR InfiniBand networking will power five systems awarded by EuroHPC, a European initiative to build extra scale supercomputing. This includes CINECA, a university consortium in Italy and one of the world\u2019s most important supercomputing centers, which will use NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform to build the world\u2019s fastest AI supercomputer. CINECA supercomputer named Leonardo advances the age of exascale AI, delivering 10 exaflops of AI performance to enable AI and high-performance computing converge applications use cases. It is built with nearly 14,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and Mellanox HDR 200 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking. And just released top 500 list of supercomputers show that NVIDIA GPUs or network empowered nearly 70%, and 8 of the 10 top supercomputers on the list. Mellanox had another record quarter with double-digit sequential growth well ahead of our expectations, contributing 13% of overall Company revenue. The upside reflected sales to China OEM that will not recur in Q4. As a result, we expect a meaningful sequential revenue decline from Mellanox in Q4, but still growing 30% from last year. Mellanox reached record revenue in both InfiniBand and Ethernet, driven by cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. Strong demand for high-performance interconnects where Mellanox is leader is being fueled by AI increasingly complex applications, which demand faster, smarter, more scalable networks. As the data center becomes the new unit of computing in the age of AI, Mellanox networking is foundational to modern scalable architectures. At GTC in October, we unveiled the BlueField-2 DPU, or data processing unit, a new kind of processor, which offloads critical networking, storage and security tasks from the CPU. A single BlueField-2 DPU can deliver the same data center services that consume up to 125 CPU cores. This frees up valuable CPU cores to run a wide range of other enterprise applications. In addition, it enables zero trust security features to prevent data breaches and cyber attacks and accelerates overall performance. VMware announced that it will offload, accelerate and isolate its industry leading ESXi hypervisor with NVIDIA\u2019s BlueField-2 DPU, boosting vSphere and data center performance and efficiency. We also unveiled our three-year DPU roadmap, unified Mellanox\u2019s leading network capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and the new NVIDIA DOCA or data-center-on-a-chip architecture. Software development kit for building DPU accelerated applications. We believe that over time DPUs will ship a millions of servers, unlocking a $10 billion total addressable market. BlueField-2 is sampling now with major hyperscale customers and will be integrated into the enterprise server offerings of major OEMs. This was our busy period for product launches. Earlier this week at Supercomputing 2020, we announced the new double capacity, A100 80 gigabyte GPUs and DGX systems for organizations to build, train and deploy massive AI models. We also announced the new DGX Station A100, a powerful workgroup server with four A100 GPUs and a massive 320 gigabyte GPU memory for data scientists and AI researchers working in offices, research facilities, labs or at home. All these additions to the NVIDIA Ampere architecture family of products will be available early next year. At SC20, we also announced the next generation NVIDIA Mellanox 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand architecture, giving AI developers and scientific researchers the fastest available networking performance. This doubles data throughput and adds new in network computing engine to provide additional acceleration. Solutions based on this new architecture are expected to sample in the second quarter of calendar 2021. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margin was 62.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 65.5%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year, primarily due to charges related to the Mellanox acquisition, partially offset by product mix. The sequential increase was driven by the absence of non-recurring inventory step-up expense related to the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by 140 basis points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales, including the contribution from Mellanox. Non-GAAP gross margin was down 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations, driven by product mix. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $1.56 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 6% and 42% from a year ago, respectively. Q3 GAAP, EPS was $2.12, up 46% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.91, up 63% from a year ago. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.28 billion. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, Q4 includes a 14th week, which we expect to be incrementally -- addition to revenue and operating expenses. We expect gaming to be up sequentially in what is typically a seasonally down quarter, as we continue to ramp up our new RTX 30 Series products. We expect data center to be down slightly versus Q3. With that, we expect computing products to grow in the mid-single-digit sequentially, more than offset by sequential decline in Mellanox. We expect continued sequential growth in auto and ProViz but not yet returning to year-on-year growth. And we expect a seasonal decline in OEM. Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.8% and 65.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.64 billion and $1.1 8 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We\u2019ll be virtually attending the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on November 30th, Wells Fargo TMT Summit December 1st and the UBS TMT Conference on December 7th. Our earnings call to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 24th. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Can you hear me?\nJensen Huang: Yes.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Hey, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Just Colette, going back to your commentary around Mellanox, it seems like you\u2019re guiding the January quarter to about $500 million, which means the core data center business is still growing nicely, call it, 6%, 7% sequentially. I\u2019m just kind of curious, when you look at the core data center business, I know there\u2019s not a direct correlation to server business. But, we\u2019re clearly going through a cloud digestion in server and core vertical markets, enterprise, the servers are weak. When you look at your core data center business, do you feel as though that\u2019s having an impact, and this is sort of the digestion that you saw kind of in late fiscal \u201820 -- sorry, fiscal \u201819 into \u201820, but you\u2019re doing it still growing significantly year-over-year, or how would you characterize the macro backdrop?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me clarify for those also on the call. Yes, we expect our data center revenue in total to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter. The computing products, NVIDIA computing product is expected to grow in the mid-single-digits quarter-over-quarter as we continue the NVIDIA AI adoption and particularly as A100 continues to ramp. Our networking, our Mellanox networking is expected to decline meaningful quarter-over-quarter as sales to that China OEM will not recur in Q4, though we still expect the results to be growth of 30% or more year-over-year. The timing of some of this business therefore shifted from Q4 to Q3, but overall H2 is quite strong. So, in referring to overall digestion, the hyperscale business remains extremely strong. We expect hyperscale to grow quarter-over-quarter in computing products as A100 continues to ramp. The A100 continues to gain adoption, not only across those hyperscale customers, but again we\u2019re also receiving great momentum in inferencing with the A100 and the T4. I\u2019ll turn it over here to Jensen to see if he has more that he would like to add.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Colette captured it very well. The only thing I would add is that our inference initiative is really gaining great momentum. Inference is one of the hardest computer science problems. Compiling these gigantic neural network computational graphs into a target device really, really -- has proven to be really, really hard. The models are diverse when you count vision to language to speech. And there are so many different types of models being created that model sizes are doubling every couple of months. The latency expectations are increasing all the time, -- or latency is decreasing all the time. And so, the pressure on inference is really great. The technology pressure is really great. And our leadership there is really pulling ahead. We\u2019re in our seventh generation tensorRT. We, over the course of the last couple of years, developed an inference server. It\u2019s called Triton, has been adopted all over the place. We have several hundred customers now using NVIDIA AI to deploy their AI services. This is in the early innings, and I think this is going to be our largest near-term growth opportunity. So, we\u2019re really firing on all cylinders there between the A100s ramping in the cloud, A100s beginning to ramp in enterprise, and all of our inference initiatives are really doing great.\nJohn Pitzer: Jensen, maybe to follow on there just on the vertical markets, clearly work-from-home and COVID this year kind of presented a headwind to new technology deployments on-prem. I\u2019m kind of curious, if we expect sort of an enterprise recovery in general next year, how do you think that will translate into your vertical market strategy? And is there anything else above and beyond that you can do to help accelerate penetration of AI into that end market?\nJensen Huang: Yes. John, that\u2019s a good point. I mean, it\u2019s very clear that the inability to go to work is slowing down the adoption of new technology in some of the verticals. Of course, we\u2019re seeing rapid adoption in certain verticals, like for example using AI in health care to rapidly discover new vaccines and early detection with outbreaks and robotic applications. So, warehouses, digital retail, last mile delivery, we\u2019re just seeing just really, really great enthusiasm around adopting new AI and robotics technology. But in some of the more traditional industries, new capabilities and new technologies are slow to deploy. One of the areas that I\u2019m really super excited about is the work that we\u2019re doing in remote work and making it possible for people to collaborate remotely. We have a platform called Omniverse. It\u2019s in early beta. The feedback from the marketplace has been really great. And so, I\u2019ve got a lot more to report to you guys in the upcoming months around Omniverse. And so -- but anyways, I think, when the industry recover, we serve -- our fundamental purpose as a company is to solve the greatest challenges that impact the industry where ordinary computers can\u2019t. And these challenges are -- serve some of the most important applications in the verticals that we address. And they\u2019re not commodity applications. They\u2019re really impactful, needle-moving applications. So, I have every confidence that when the industries recover, things will get designed. Cars will be designed, and planes will be designed, and ships will be designed, and buildings will be designed. And we\u2019re going to see a lot of design, and we\u2019re going to see a lot of simulation. We\u2019re going to see a lot of robotics applications.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: You talked about in your prepared remarks limited availability of capacity components. You suggested perhaps a few months to catch up. Curious if you can speak to the visibility that you have for both, gaming and data center into your April quarter?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Colette, do you want me to take that real quick and maybe you can help me out?\nColette Kress: Yes, absolutely.\nJensen Huang: So, C.J., first off, we have a lot of visibility into the channel, as you know, especially for gaming. And we know how many weeks of inventory is in what parts of the channel. We\u2019ve been draining down the channel inventory for Turing for some time. And meanwhile, we\u2019ve also expected a very, very successful launch with Ampere. And even with our bullish demand expectation and all of the Amperes that we built, which is one of the fastest ramps ever, the demand is still overwhelming. And this I guess in a lot of ways is kind of expected, the circumstances are -- it\u2019s been a decade since we\u2019ve invented a new type of computer graphics. I mean, two years ago, we invented [indiscernible] and it set the industry on course to create the type of images that we see today. But, it\u2019s very clear that the future is going to look something much, much more beautiful. And we invented NVIDIA RTX to do that. And it has two capabilities, one based on ray tracing and the other one is based on artificial intelligence image generation. The combination of those two capabilities is creating images that people are pretty ecstatic about. And at this point, it\u2019s defined the next-generation content. And so when we -- it took us 10 years to invent it. We launched it two years ago and took our second generation to really achieve the level of quality and performance that the industry -- that they really expect. And now, the demand is just overwhelming. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to ramp fast. And this is going to be one of our most successful ramps ever. And it gives our installed base of some 200-million-plus GeForce gamers the best reason to upgrade in over a decade. And so, this is going to be a very large generation for us is my guess. And then, with respect to data center, we\u2019re ramping into A100. A100 is our first generation of GPUs that does several things at the same time. It\u2019s universal. We position it as a universal because it\u2019s able to do all of the applications that we in the past had to have multiple GPUs to do. It does training well. It does inference incredibly well. It does high-performance computing. It does data analytics. And so, it\u2019s able -- the Ampere architecture is able to do all of this at the same time. And so, the utilization for data centers is -- and the utility is really, really fantastic, and the reception has been great. And so, we\u2019re going to ramp into all of the world\u2019s clouds. I think, starting this quarter, we\u2019re now in every major cloud provider in the world, including Alibaba or Golan, [ph] and of course the giants, the Amazon, the Azure and Google Clouds. And we\u2019re going to continue to ramp into that. And then, of course, we\u2019re starting to ramp into enterprise, which in my estimation, long term will still be the largest growth opportunity for us, turning every industry into a AI, turning every company into AIs and augment it with Al and bringing the iPhone moment to all of the world\u2019s largest industries. And so, we\u2019re ramping into that, and we\u2019re seeing a great deal of enthusiasm.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: You said that the extra week was contributing incrementally to revenue and OpEx. Can you give us some feeling for how much is contributing to revenue and OpEx in Q4? And does that impact, at least on the revenue side, differ, say between like gaming and data center? And then, how should we think about it impacting seasonality into Q1 as that extra week rolls off?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me try this one, Jensen. Yes, we\u2019ve incorporated that 14th week into our guidance for both, revenue and OpEx. We will likely have incrementally positive impact on revenue, although it is tough to quantify, okay? Our outlook also reflects incremental OpEx for Q4 in primarily two different areas in terms of compensation and depreciation. And given that our employees with such a material power of our OpEx, it will -- it can be close to one-fourteenth of the quarter. Now, when we look a little bit farther, we should think about the incremental positive in both, gaming and data center from that extra week as there hopefully will be extra supply, but not likely as much as one-fourteenth of the quarter of revenue as enterprise demand is essentially project-based, and game demand though is tied to the number of gaming that gamers that might be shopping for the overall holiday. So, again, still very hard for us to determine at this time. Normally, between Q4 and Q1 there is seasonality in gaming, seasonality downward. But, we\u2019ll just have to see as we are still supply-constrained within this Q4 to see what that looks like. From an OpEx standpoint, we\u2019ll probably expect our OpEx to be relatively flattish as we move from Q4 to Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth. Jensen, my question is on competition from internally designed products by some of your larger cloud customers, Amazon and Google and others. We hear about competition from time to time. And I wanted to get your perspective. Is this a manageable risk? Is the right way to think that they are perhaps using more of your product in their public cloud, but they are moving to internal products for internal workloads? Just how should we think about this risk going forward? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Vivek. Most of the cloud vendors, in fact, I believe all of the cloud vendors use the same infrastructures largely for their internal cloud and external cloud, or have the ability to or largely do. And, there\u2019s -- the competition, we find to be really good. And the reason for that is this. It just suggests that acceleration -- they make it very clear, that acceleration is right path forward for training and inference. The vast majority of the world\u2019s training models are doubling in size every couple of months, and it\u2019s one of the reasons where our demand is so great. The second is inference. The vast majority of the world\u2019s inference is not on CPUs. And nothing is better than the whole world recognizing that the best way forward is to do inference on accelerators. And when that happens, our accelerator is the most versatile. It is the highest performance. We move the fastest. Our rate of innovation is the fastest because we\u2019re also the most dedicated to it, we\u2019re most committed to it, and we have the largest team in the world to it. Our stack is the most advanced, giving us the greatest versatility and performance. And so, we see spots of announcement here and there. But, they\u2019re also our largest customers. And as you know that we\u2019re ramping quite nicely at Google, we\u2019re ramping quite nicely at Amazon and Microsoft and Alibaba and Oracle and others. And so, I think, the big takeaway is that -- and the great opportunity for us if you look at the vast amount of workload -- AI workload in the world, the vast majority of it today is still on CPUs. And it\u2019s very clear that this is going to be an accelerated workload. And we\u2019re the best accelerator in the world. And, this is going to be a really big growth opportunity for us in near term. In fact, we believe it\u2019s our largest growth opportunity in near term. And we\u2019re in the early innings of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and great job on the quarterly execution. The Mellanox networking connectivity business was up 80% year-over-year. I think, it was up about 13%, 14% sequentially. I know there was upside in October from one China customer, but it did grow 70% year-over-year last quarter, and you\u2019re still expecting 30% year-over-year growth next quarter. If I remember correctly, I think, InfiniBand is about 40% of that business; Ethernet Cloud is about 60%. Jensen, what are the big drivers, especially since we\u2019re in the midst of a cloud spending digestion cycle? And I just saw that the team announced their next-gen 400-gig InfiniBand solution, which should drive another strong adoption cycle with your supercomputer customers. When does this upgrade cycle start to fire?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Let\u2019s see. Our data center business consists of supercomputing centers, which is small, high-performance computing, which is a much larger part of super computing, much larger than supercomputing, and then hyperscale and enterprise, which about 50-50. Of the data center business, the accelerated computing part is not very much associated with digestion than others. It\u2019s much more associated with workloads and our new product cycles, the TCO that we bring in and AI inference, the type of models that the cloud service providers are deploying, whether they\u2019re deploying new AI models, based on deep learning, and how much of it that we -- how much of those workloads that we\u2019ve completed, the porting to our accelerators and ready it for deployment. And so, those are the factors associated with accelerated computing. It\u2019s really about the apps, it\u2019s really about the workloads and really driven by AI. On the other hand, the networking part of our business is more connected to CPU business because they\u2019re much more broad-based. The networking part of our business is driven by this idea of new hyperscale data center architecture called disaggregation. It\u2019s software disaggregation, not necessarily hardware disaggregation. Software disaggregation, where this type of software called Kubernetes orchestrate microservices that are deployed across the data center. So, one service, one application isn\u2019t monolithic running on one computer anymore. It\u2019s distributed across multiple computers and multiple nodes, so that the hyperscale data centers can more easily scale up and scale out according to the workloads and according to the demand on the data center. And so, this disaggregation has caused the networking between the compute nodes to be of all vital importance. And because Mellanox is the lowest-latency, highest-performance, highest-bandwidth network that you can get the TCO benefit at the data center scale is really fantastic. And so, when they\u2019re building out data centers, Mellanox is going to be much more connected to that. In the enterprise side of it, depending on new CPU cycles, it could affect them. If a CPU cycle were to delay a little bit, it would affect them by a quarter, it would pull-in by a quarter -- it would affect them by pull-in of a quarter. And so, those are kind of the dynamics of it. I think, that the net-net of it is that it\u2019s a foregone conclusion at this point that AI is going to be the future of the way software is run. AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. And acceleration is the best path forward. And so, that\u2019s what drives our computing business. And the networking business has everything to do with the way architecture of data centers, cloud data centers, which is architected with micro services now. And that\u2019s what foundationally drives their -- our networking work business demand. And so, we\u2019re really well-positioned in these two fundamental dynamics because as we know, AI is the future and cloud computing is the future. Both of those dynamics are very favorable to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask a question that was asked before in a bit of a different way. If I look at the core business, excluding Mellanox, the core data center business, it was up about 6% sequentially the past two quarters, and your guidance sort of implies up about that much again in January, which is certainly good, and there is some cloud digestion. But, of course you have Ampere still ramping as well, which should be a pretty good tailwind. So, there seems to be some offsetting factors. So, I guess, I wonder if you feel like your core data center revenue is still being constrained right now by some market digestion. And kind of how you sort of balance or handicap these two factors? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Our growth is -- in the near term is more affected by the cycle time of manufacturing and flexibility of supply. We are in a good shape to -- and all of our supply is -- informs our guidance. But, we would appreciate shorter cycle times; we would appreciate more agile supply chains. But, the world is constrained at the moment. And so, we just have to make the best of it. But, even in that condition - even in that condition, we\u2019ve -- all of that is building for our guidance, and we expect to grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and also congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to kind of the Mellanox question. I know prior to the acquisition, Mellanox was growing maybe in the mid to high-20% range. These last two quarters, it\u2019s grown over 75%. I guess, the simple question is how do you think about the growth rate for Mellanox going forward? And on that topic, we started to hear you talk more about BlueField and data processing units. I think, in your commentary, you alluded to server OEM design wins incorporating these DPUs. What are you looking at, or when should we think about the DPU business really starting to inflect and become a material driver for the business? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Long term, every computer in the world will be built like a data center. And every node of a data center is going to be a data center in itself. And the reason for that is because we want the attack surface to be basically zero. And today, most of the data centers are only protected as a periphery. But in the future, if you would like cloud computing to be the architecture for everything and every data center is multi-tenant, every data center is secure, then you\u2019re going to have to secure every single node. And each one of those nodes are going to be a software-defined networking, software-defined storage, and it\u2019s going to have per application security. And so, the processing that it will need to offload, the CPUs, is really quite significant. In fact, we believe that somewhere between 20% to 40% of today\u2019s data centers -- cloud data centers is the capacity, the throughput, the computational load is consumed running basically the infrastructure overhead. And that\u2019s what the DPUs intended -- was designed to do. We\u2019re going to offload that, number one; and number two, we\u2019re going to make every single application secure. And confidential competing, zero trust computing will become a reality. And so, the importance is really quite tremendous. And I believe therefore that every single server in the world will have a DPU inside someday, just because we care so much about security and just because we care so much about throughput and TCO. And it\u2019s really the most cost-effective way of building a data center. And so, I expect our DPU business to be quite large. And so, that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re putting so much energy into it. It\u2019s a programmable data center on a chip, think of that way, and data center infrastructure on a chip. It is the reason why we\u2019re working with VMware on taking the operating system in the data center, the software-defined operating system in the data center, putting bring it on BlueField. And so, this is a very important initiative for us. I\u2019m very excited about it, as you can imagine.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Yes. Thank you very much. Colette -- and I apologize if I missed it, but for Mellanox, do you expect it to get back to the growth trajectory on a sequential basis in the April quarter? And I\u2019m assuming that the shortfall in the current quarter is from a pull-in from Huawei?\nColette Kress: So, our impact to our Q4 guidance for Mellanox, yes, is impacted by a sale to a China OEM for Mellanox. That will not recur in Q4. And as we look forth into Q1 of April, we\u2019re going to take this a quarter at a time and provide thoughts and guidance for that once we turn the corner to the new fiscal year.\nJensen Huang: At the highest level, Colette, I think, the -- it\u2019s safe to say that high-speed networking is going to be one of the most important things in cloud data centers as we go forward. And the vast majority of the world\u2019s data center is still built for the traditional hyper-converged architecture, which is all moving over to microservices-based disaggregate --software-defined disaggregated architectures. And that journey is still in its early days. And so, I fully expect future cloud data centers -- all future data centers are going to be connected with high-speed networking inside. They call it east-west traffic. And, all of the traffic will be secured. And so, imagine building firewalls into every single server. And imagine every single transaction, every single transmission inside the data center to be high speed and fully encrypted. And so, pretty amazing amount of computation is going to have to be installed into future data centers. But, that\u2019s an accepted requirement now. And I think, our networking business, Mellanox is in the early innings of growth.\nOperator: Your final question today comes from the line of William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019ve given us some pieces of this puzzle. But, I\u2019m hoping maybe you can address directly the sort of SKU-by-SKU rollout of Ampere. We know that we didn\u2019t have a ton of SKUs last quarter. There were more in this quarter that you just announced. Now, you\u2019re doing sort of this refresh it sounds like with double the memory on the A100. Is the T4 going to be refreshed? And if so, when does that happen? And, are there other, either systems or chips that are still waiting for the Ampere refresh that could potentially contribute to an extended cycle as we look at the next year?\nJensen Huang: Yes. In terms of the total number of SKUs that we\u2019ve ramped of Ampere, we\u2019re probably somewhere along a third to a half of the SKUs at this point, maybe a little bit less. Yes, it\u2019s less. The way that you could think through it, you could reverse engineer it, it is like this. You know what our gaming lineup looks like for desktops. And so, traditionally, we try to have a new architecture in every single segment. And we\u2019ve not gone below 499 yet. And so, there\u2019s a very big part of the marketplace that we\u2019re still in the process of addressing. And then, the second thing is laptops. None of the Ampere architecture has launched for laptops. And then, there\u2019s workstations. And you do the same thing with desktops and workstations and laptops workstations. And none of those have gone out yet. And then, there\u2019s data center. And our data center business for cloud, you\u2019ve seen some of the early versions of it, A100. But, then, there\u2019s cloud computing for graphics, there\u2019s cloud gaming. For those enterprise, edge enterprise applications, enterprise data analytics applications. And so, there\u2019s a fair number of exciting new products we still have in front of us.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A for today. I now turn the call back to Ms. Jankowski for closing remarks.\nSimona Jankowski: Actually, that will be for Jensen.\nOperator: My apologies.\nJensen Huang: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Simona. This was a terrific quarter. NVIDIA is firing on all cylinders. And the RTX has reinvented graphics and has made real-time ray tracing the standard of next generation content, creating the best ever reason to upgrade for hundreds of millions of NVIDIA gamers. AI, where software writes software no humans can, is the most powerful technology force of our time and is impacting every industry. NVIDIA AI again swept MLPerf training and now inference as well, extending our leadership in this important new way of doing computing. NVIDIA AI\u2019s new Triton inference server, a platform that I will speak a lot more about in the future and a lot more frequently because it\u2019s important, and our full stack optimized platform are gaining rapid adoption to operate many of the world\u2019s most popular AI-enhanced services, opening a major growth opportunity. Data centers are the new unit of computing. Someday, we believe there will be millions of autonomous data centers distributed all over the globe. NVIDIA\u2019s BlueField DPU programmable data center on a chip and our rich software stack will help place AI data centers in factories, warehouses, 5G base stations and even on wheels. And with our pending acquisition of Arm, the company that builds the world\u2019s most popular CPU, we will create the computing company for the age of AI, with computing extending from the cloud to trillions of devices. Thank you for joining us today. I wish all of you happy holidays. And please do stay safe, and I look forward to seeing you guys next time.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another extraordinary quarter. The world continued to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and most of our employees continue to work from home, but through the team\u2019s agility and dedication, we successfully combined Mellanox into NVIDIA while also delivering a very strong quarter. Revenue was $3.87 billion, up 50% year-on-year, up 26% sequentially and well ahead of our outlook. Starting with gaming, revenue was $1.65 billion, was up 26% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially significantly ahead of our expectations. The upside is broad-based across geographic regions, products and channels. Gaming\u2019s growth amid the pandemic highlights the emergence of a leading form of entertainment worldwide. For example, the number of daily gamers on Steam, a leading PC game online distributor, is up 25% from pre-pandemic levels and NPD reported that U.S. consumer spending on videogames grew 30% in the second calendar quarter to a record $11 billion. NVIDIA\u2019s PCs and laptops are ideal for the millions of people who are now working, learning and gaming at home. At the outset of the pandemic, many retail outlets were closed and demand shifted to online channels. As the quarter progressed and the stores reopened, retail demand picked up, iCafes largely reopened and online sales continued to thrive. Gaming laptop demand is very strong as students and professionals turn to GeForce-based systems to improve how they work, learn, and game from home. We ramped over 100 new models with our OEM partners focused on both premium and mainstream price points. In the premium laptop segment, we delivered unparalleled performance with the GeForce RTX 2080 and the 2070 SUPER GPUs [indiscernible] form factors. We also brought ray tracing to gaming laptops for the first time at price points as low as $999 with the GeForce RTX 2060. In the mainstream segment, we brought the GeForce GTX to laptop price points as low as $699. Momentum continues for our Turing architecture, which enables stunning new visual effects in games and is driving powerful upgrade cycle among gamers. Its RTX technology adds ray tracing and AI to programmable shading and has quickly redefined the new standard for computer graphics. DLSS used the AI capabilities of Turing to boost frame rates by almost 2x, while generating crisp image quality. RTX support in blockbuster games continues to grow, including Mega-Hit DEATH STRANDING, the highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and the upcoming release of Watch Dogs. These games join Minecraft and other major titles that support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS. We are in the midst of a 21-day countdown campaign promoting a GeForce special event on September 1, with each day highlighting a year in the history of GeForce. We don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise, but we encourage you to tune in. We are very pleased with the traction of our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service now in its second quarter of commercial availability. GFN offers the richest content to any game streaming service through partnerships with leading digital game stores, including Valve Steam, Epic Games and Ubisoft Uplay. GeForce NOW enables users with underpowered PC, Macs or Android devices to access powerful GPUs to play their libraries of PC games in the cloud, expanding the universe of gamers that we can reach with GeForce. Just yesterday, we announced that GFN is now supported on Chromebooks further expanding our reach into tens of millions of users. In addition to NVIDIA\u2019s own service, GFN is available or coming soon to a number of telecom partners around the world, including SoftBank and KDDI in Japan, Rostelecom and Beeline in Russia, LG U+ in South Korea and Taiwan Mobile. Moving to Pro Vis, in Q2 was $203 million in revenue, down 30% year-on-year and down 34% sequentially, with declines in both mobile and desktop workstations. Sales were hurt by lower enterprise demand amid the closure of many offices around the world. Industries negatively impacted during the quarter, include automotive, architectural engineering and construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment and oil and gas. Initiatives by enterprises to enable remote workers drove demand for virtual and cloud-based graphic solutions. Accordingly, our Q2 vGPU bookings accelerated increasing 60% year-on-year. Despite near-term challenges, we are winning new business in areas such as healthcare, including Siemens, Philips and General Electric and the public sector. We continue to expand our market opportunity with over 50 leading design and creative applications that are NVIDIA RTX-enabled, including the latest release from Foundry, Chaos Group, and Maxon. These applications provide faster ray tracing and accelerated performance, improving creators\u2019 design workflows. The pandemic will have a lasting impact on how we work. Our revenue mix going forward will likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as NVIDIA laptops and virtual workstations that enable remote work and virtual collaboration. Moving to automotive, automotive revenue was $111 million, down 47% year-over-year and down 28% sequentially. This was slightly better than our outlook of a 40% sequential decline as the impact of the pandemic was less pronounced than expected, with auto production volumes starting to recover after bottoming in April. Some of the decline is also due to the roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue, which remained a headwind in future quarters. In June, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz, which starting in 2024 will launch software-defined intelligent vehicles across an entire fleet in using end-to-end NVIDIA technology. Mercedes will utilize NVIDIA\u2019s full technology stack, including the DRIVE AGX computer, DRIVE AV autonomous driving software and NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure spanning from the core to the cloud. Centralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and upgrade advanced software features as they are developed. With over-the-air updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending majority of ownership with each software upgrade. This is a transformator announcement for the automotive industry making the turning point of traditional vehicles becoming high-performance updatable data centers on wheels. It\u2019s also a transformative announcement for NVIDIA\u2019s evolving business model as the software content of our platforms grows positioning us to build a recurring revenue stream. Moving to data center, data center is a diverse, consist of cloud service providers, public cloud providers, supercomputing centers, enterprises, telecom and industrial edge. Q2 revenue was a record $1.75 billion, up 167% year-on-year and up 54% sequentially. In Q2, we incorporated a full quarter of contribution from the Mellanox acquisition, which closed on April 27, the first day of our quarter. Mellanox contributed approximately 14% of company revenue and just over 30% of data center revenue. Both compute and networking within data center set a record with accelerating year-on-year growth. The biggest news in data center this quarter was the launch of our Ampere architecture. We are very proud of the team\u2019s execution in launching and ramping this technological marvel especially amid the pandemic. The A100 is the largest chip ever made with 54 billion transistors. It runs our full software stack for accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads. Our software leases include CUDA 11, the new versions of over 50 CUDA-X libraries and a new application framework for major AI workloads, such as Jarvis for conversational AI and Merlin for deep recommender systems. The A100 delivers NVIDIA\u2019s greatest generational leap ever, boosting AI performance by 20x over its predecessor. It is also our first universal accelerator unifying AI training and inference and powering workloads, such as data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics, 5G services and graphics. The first Ampere GPU, A100, has been widely adopted by all major server vendors and cloud service providers. Google Cloud platform was the first cloud customer to bring it to market making it the fastest GPU to come to the cloud in our history. And just this morning, Microsoft Azure announced the availability of massively scalable AI clusters, which are based on the A100 and interconnected with 200-gigabyte-per-second Mellanox InfiniBand networking. A100 is also getting incorporated into offerings from AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Tencent Cloud. And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world, including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch, with 30 systems expected this summer and over 40 more by the end of the year. The A100 is already winning industry recognition in the latest A100 training benchmark, MLPerf 0.7 NVIDIA set 16 records, sweeping all categories for commercially available solutions in both per chip and outscale performance based on the A100. MLPerf offers the industry\u2019s first and only objective AI benchmark. Since the benchmark was introduced 2 years ago, NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference. NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest TOP500 list of the fastest supercomputers. The ranking, released in June, showed that 8 of the world\u2019s top 10 supercomputers use NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S. and Europe. NVIDIA now combined with Mellanox powers two-thirds of the top 500 systems on the list compared with just less than a half for the two companies in total 2 years ago. In energy efficiencies, systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they are nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs measured by gigaflops per watt. The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA\u2019s own new Selene supercomputer, which debuted as number seven on the TOP500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier. Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than 4 weeks using NVIDIA\u2019s open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years. This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks and it is a reference design that\u2019s available for our customers to quickly build a world class supercomputer. We also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics, one of the largest and fastest growing enterprise workloads. We enabled end-to-end acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June. Spark is the world\u2019s leading data analytics platform used by more than 500,000 data scientists and 16,000 enterprises worldwide. And we have two major milestones to share. We have now shipped a cumulative total of 1 billion CUDA GPUs and the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem just reached 2 million. It took over a decade to reach the first million and less than 2 years to reach the second million. Mellanox has fantastic results across the Board in its first quarter as part of NVIDIA. Mellanox revenue growth accelerated with strength across Ethernet and InfiniBand products. Our Ethernet shipments reached a new record. Major hyperscale build drove the upside in the quarter as growth in cloud computing and AI is fueling increased demand for high-performance networking. Mellanox networking was a critical part of several of our major new product introductions this quarter. These include the DGX AI system, the DGX SuperPOD clusters for our Selene supercomputer and the EGX Edge AI platform. We also launched the Mellanox ConnectX-6 Ethernet NIC, the 11th generation product of the ConnectX family and is designed to meet the needs of modern cloud and hyperscale data centers, where 25, 50 and 100 gigabyte per second is becoming the standard. We expanded our switch networking capabilities with the addition of Cumulus Networks, a privately held network software company that we purchased in June. Cumulus augments our Mellanox acquisition in building out open modern data center. The combination of NVIDIA accelerated computing, Mellanox networking and Cumulus software enables data centers that are accelerated, disaggregated and software-defined to meet the exponential growth in AI, cloud and high-performance computing. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 58.8% and non-GAAP gross margin was 66%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year and sequentially due to costs associated with the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by almost 6 points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales and lower automotive sales. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $1.62 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.04 billion, up 67% and 38% from a year ago, respectively. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.99, up 10% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 76% from the year ago. Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.57 billion. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus 2%. With that, we expect gaming to be up just over 25% sequentially, with data center to be up in the low to mid-single digits sequentially. We expect both pro vis and auto to be at similar levels out in Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.5% and 65.5% respectively plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.54 billion and $1.09 billion respectively. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx is tracking in line with our outlook of $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the BMO Virtual Technology Summit on August 25, Citi\u2019s 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 9, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Technology Conference on September 14 and the Evercore\u2019s Virtual Memo Forum, The Future of Mobility, on September 21. We will also host a financial analyst Q&A with Jensen on October 5 as part of our next virtual GTC. Our earnings call to discuss our third quarter\u2019s results is scheduled for Wednesday, November 18. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Jensen, I am wondering how much of the strength that you are seeing in gaming and data center is maybe more temporary because of COVID or some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into hopefully sooner rather than later into a more normalized period for the industry?\nJensen Huang: Yes, Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn\u2019t see pull-ins and we are in the beginning of our brand new product cycle with Ampere and so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, with all that\u2019s happening around the world and it\u2019s really unfortunate but it\u2019s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time \u2013 spending their time in videogames. The thing that people haven\u2019t realized about videogames is that it\u2019s not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you are spending time with your friends, you are using it to create to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people. And so \u2013 and then of course, it\u2019s just an incredibly fun way to spend time even by consumption of the video \u2013 of a videogame. And so there is just so much that you could do with videogames now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. And PC is now the single largest entertainment platform \u2013 is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s not just about gaming. There\u2019s just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. With data center the things that \u2013 the structural change that\u2019s happening in data center are coupled with different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud, the way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it\u2019s really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It\u2019s a type of software that really wants acceleration. And NVIDIA\u2019s GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it. And then the last reason about the data center is the \u2013 this architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that\u2019s driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. And so, because of this type of architecture, two components, two types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was \u2013 is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into this \u2013 in a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run. That transition is called east-west traffic. And the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that\u2019s what Mellanox is fantastic at. And so, we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that\u2019s why \u2013 that\u2019s the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven. And that\u2019s the benefit of our GPUs. And then, lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that\u2019s where Mellanox comes in. And so, I think that this is \u2013 the dynamics that I am describing are permanent, and it\u2019s just been accelerated to the present, because of everything that\u2019s happening to us. But this is the future, and it\u2019s not \u2013 there\u2019s no going back. It\u2019s \u2013 and we just found everything accelerated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Jensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you have been radical on that for some time. And when you have been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly picking that approach. So, I guess, the question is why do you think you won\u2019t have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this, talk about you and ARM. So, I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system. But we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining it to Vivek just now that a microservice that we are enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. And so, the data center is running \u2013 the entire data center is running an application. I mean, that\u2019s pretty remarkable thing. And that happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that, as a computing company, we have to be a data center scale company and we architect from that starting. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink, with eight processors being fully synchronized across the computing node, and we created the DGX. We recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that\u2019s why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it\u2019s GPUDirect or, recently, the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all in one holistic way. And then in the last \u2013 in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world\u2019s first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world\u2019s first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be one GPU or, with NVlink, 8 GPUs combined, working together. So you could think of them as being titled, so those 8 GPUs are working harmoniously together or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don\u2019t need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so, whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes, create a larger GPU using NVLink, or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you would like. You made a comment about \u2013 you asked a question about ARM. We have been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it\u2019s autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we are in. And then, recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so, we worked with the ARM team very closely. They are really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it\u2019s incredibly energy-efficient. And because it\u2019s energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so, anyways, we love working with the ARM guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just building on some prior questions. The first one, I was just curious if you could help us appreciate kind of the installed base of the gaming GPU business, relative to where we are at the Turing upgrade cycle, what do we see still on prior generations, be it Pascal or before? And then secondly, I was wondering, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How that \u2013 how has that changed over the last 3 months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are \u2013 we are still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we are in, is the world\u2019s first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses \u2013 the RTX technology fuses three fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics, and we added two new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene \u2013 objects in scene super, super fast. And that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a complicated problem. It\u2019s a super complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that\u2019s really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it\u2019s even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it\u2019s also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that\u2019s called RTX. And Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we are in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they are going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it\u2019s really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.\nAaron Rakers: And then on the data center visibility?\nColette Kress: Yes. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you have seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we are still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It\u2019s ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than a quarter of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess two questions. If I look at your outstanding inventory purchase obligations, grew 17% sequentially. Is that \u2013 as you prepare for the September 1 launch? And can you kind of comment on gaming visibility into the back half of the year? And then the second question, Jensen, I know you are very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. I would love to hear if there\u2019s any particular platforms over the last 3 months where you have made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks so much, C.J. We are expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now, they are hanging out with friends. They are using it to create other content. They are using, game captures, create art. They are sharing it with the community. It\u2019s a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described, require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems and \u2013 but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so, the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. And the second thing is that RTX, it\u2019s a home run. We really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it\u2019s really, really the next level. It\u2019s not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so, for the last 15 years, we have been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there\u2019s never been a giant leap like this. And RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. And then the third factor is the console launch. There\u2019s \u2013 people are really \u2013 the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And because of the gaming \u2013 because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home, I think it\u2019s going to be the most amazing season ever. We are already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has \u2013 about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom. I mean \u2013 which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean, they are on their way to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so, I am super excited for them. And so, I think it\u2019s going to be quite a huge second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJensen Huang: Colette, I felt like I didn\u2019t \u2013 I missed C.J.\u2019s second question. Can we jump on and answer it?\nColette Kress: I think your \u2013 I think the question was regarding our inventory purchases on that piece. Is that the part that you are referring to?\nJensen Huang: Yes, that\u2019s the one. Yes.\nColette Kress: Yeah. Keep in mind, C.J., that when you think about the complexity of the products that we are building, we have extremely long lead times, both in terms of what we produce for the data center, our full systems that we need to do, as well as what you are seeing now between the sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 for overall gaming. So, all of that is in preparation for the second half. Nothing unusual about it other than, yes, we have got to hit those revenue numbers that are in our Q3 guidance.\nC.J. Muse: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman and Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking the question. I had one for Jensen and another one for Colette. Jensen, just following-up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next call it, 6 to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess the breadth that you have built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months? And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins, you are guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what\u2019s driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thank you. So and thanks for the question. The \u2013 our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence in all the services are \u2013 that are in \u2013 by the cloud service providers. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we are seeing anywhere from 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so, in the last three years, we have seen somewhere between 1,000x to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. And so, the.1 trend that we are \u2013 we are probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the \u2013 and I remember C.J.\u2019s question now, and I\u2019ll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how \u2013 what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand. And there are three big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding. The ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it\u2019s called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos and there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to \u2013 that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous. And so, the first one is natural language understanding, the second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean, we are going to have conversational engines that are just super clever. And they can predict what you\u2019re about to ask. They\u2019re going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the three pillars that I just described. And I haven\u2019t even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate. And breakthroughs that we\u2019re seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so, the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we\u2019re indexed to AI. The second, we\u2019re indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. And then the third thing that we\u2019re indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I have just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. NVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal. And these three facts that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based, and scale-up-based. And so, these \u2013 bare-metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they are at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they are at the intersection of all of that. And I just described three dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we\u2019re really indexed to. And then lastly, when somebody adopts \u2013 when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we are in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It\u2019s the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it\u2019s \u2013 it reduced \u2013 it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so, we\u2019re in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we\u2019ve ever had. And so, we are going to keep on racing through the second half.\nColette Kress: Okay. And, Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix, but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So, keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter over quarter for our overall console shipments. We are going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into data center a little bit. This is a question for Colette. So, in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what\u2019s driving the trajectory? Are you more demand- or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you\u2019d have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now?\nColette Kress: Yes. Stacy, so thanks for the question. Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we\u2019re seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we are very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that\u2019s how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it\u2019s not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100, T4. And we are also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So, I hope that helps you understand our statements on where we are at in terms of the Q3 guidance. We will see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more to that.\nJensen Huang: Well, when we are ramping, we sure love to have more and sooner. And \u2013 but this is our plan, and we are executing to the plan. It is a very complicated product, as Colette mentioned. It is the most complicated.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. Got it. And just a quick follow-up, within the data center guidance, how do you think about like the core data center sequential growth versus Mellanox?\nColette Kress: Yes. So, in terms of moving from Q2 to Q3, we believe that most of the actual growth that we will receive in that single \u2013 low single-digits to mid-single-digit growth will likely stem from NVIDIA compute will be the largest driver of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could ask a longer-term question about the \u2013 how you guys see the importance of process technology. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion around that in the CPU domain. But you guys haven\u2019t really felt the need to be first on seven-nanometer, and you have done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA?\nJensen Huang: Yes. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, alright? And so, process technology we have a really awesome process engineering team. World-class. Everybody will recognize that it\u2019s absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that is ideal for us. It\u2019s a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. Then the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We are paid for architecture. And there\u2019s a vast difference between our architecture and the second-best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the \u2013 in the transistor side. And so, it must be more complicated than that. And so, we put a lot of energy into that. And then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it\u2019s really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you\u2019re a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what\u2019s underneath it, nor do you care. And so, what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are lot of code in there. And so, what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world\u2019s best processors, and we use the world\u2019s best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world\u2019s best packaging. We\u2019re the world\u2019s first user of cobots. And whether it\u2019s \u2013 I think we are\u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure we are still the highest volume by far of 2.5D and 3D packaging. And so, we start from a great chip. We start from a great chip, but we don\u2019t end there. That\u2019s just the beginning for us. Now we take this thing all the way through systems, the system software, algorithms, networking, all the way up to the entire data center. And the difference is absolutely shocking. we built our data center, Selene, and it took us four weeks. We put up Selene in four weeks\u2019 time. It is the seventh-fastest supercomputer in the world, one of the fastest AI supercomputers in the world. It\u2019s the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world, and it broke every single record in MLPerf. And that kind of shows you something about the scale that we work and the complexity of the work that we do. And this is our \u2013 the future. It\u2019s for \u2013 the future is about data centers.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. Jensen Huang, I turn the call back over to you.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. The accelerated computing model we pioneered has clearly passed the tipping point. Adopting of NVIDIA computing is accelerating. On this foundation and leveraging one architecture, we have transformed our company in three dimensions. First, NVIDIA is a full-stack computing platform company, offering the world\u2019s most dynamic industries, the chips systems, software and libraries like NVIDIA AI to tackle their most pressing challenges. NVIDIA \u2013 second, NVIDIA is a data center-scale company with capabilities to architect, build and operate the most advanced data centers. The data center is the new computing unit. With this capability, we can create modern data center architectures that are computer maker partners, and then scale out to the world\u2019s industry. Third, NVIDIA is a software-defined company today, with rich software content like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA virtual workstation in the cloud, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Drive that will add recurring software revenue to our business model. In the coming years, AI will revolutionize software. Robotics will automate machines, and the virtual and physical worlds will become increasingly integrated through VR and AR. Industry advancements will accelerate, and NVIDIA-accelerated computing will play an important role. Our next GTC will be coming on October 5, again from my kitchen. Join me. I have some exciting developments to share with you. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 1, "year": 2021, "date": "2020-05-22 04:29:09", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Josh, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to NVIDIA's Financial Results Conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. With me on the call today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website. The webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent.  During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. These are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may vary materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release, our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, May 21, 2020, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.  During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.  With that, let me turn the call over to Jensen.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Simona. Before Colette describes our quarterly results, I'd like to thank those who are on the front lines of this crisis, first responders, health care workers, service providers, who inspires every day with their bravery and selflessness. I also want to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our colleagues here at NVIDIA. Despite many challenges, they have barely broken stride during one of the busiest periods in our history.  Our efforts related to the virus are focused in 3 areas. First, we're taking care of our families and communities. We've pooled in raises by 6 months to put more money in our employees' hands, and NVIDIA and our people have donated thus far more than $10 million to those in need.  Second, we're using NVIDIA's unique capabilities to fight the virus. A great deal of science being done on COVID-19 uses NVIDIA technology for acceleration when every second counts. Some of the many examples, including sequencing the virus, analyzing drug candidates, imaging the virus at molecular resolution with cryo-electron microscopy and identifying elevated body temperature with AI cameras.  And third, because COVID-19 won't be the last killer virus, we need to be ready for the next outbreak. NVIDIA technology is essential for the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system, a system that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the spread of disease and continuously test and monitor.  We are racing to deploy the NVIDIA Clara computational health care platforms, Clara Parabricks can accelerate genomics analysis from days to minutes. Clara Imaging will continue to partner with leading research institutes to develop state-of-the-art AI models to detect infections, and Clara Guardian will connect AI to cameras and microphones and hospitals to help overloaded staff watch over patients.  We completed the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27. Mellanox is now NVIDIA's networking brand and business unit and will be reported as part of our data center market platform, and Israel is now one of NVIDIA's major technology centers.  The new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full-stack expertise in data center architectures and tremendous scale to accelerate innovation. NVIDIA Mellanox are a perfect combination and position us for the major forces shaping the IT industry today, data center scale computing and AI.  From micro service cloud applications to machine learning and AI, accelerated computing and high-performance networking are critical to modern data centers. Previously, a CPU compute node was the unit of computing. Going forward, the new unit of computing is an entire data center. The basic computing elements are now storage servers, CPU servers and GPU servers, and are composed and orchestrated by hyperscale applications that are serving millions of users simultaneously. Connecting these computing elements together is the high-performance Mellanox networking. This is the era of data center scale computing. And together, NVIDIA Mellanox can architect end to end. Mellanox is an extraordinary company, and I'm thrilled that we're now one force to invent the future together.  Now let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Jensen. Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe, we had a very strong quarter. Q1 revenue was $3.08 billion, up 39% year-on-year, down 1% sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms.  Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.34 billion was up 27% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. We are pleased with these results, which exceeded expectations in the quarter, marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19. Let me give you some color. Early in Q1, as the epidemic unfolded, demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period. As the virus spread globally, much of the world started working and learning from home, and gameplay surged. Globally, we have seen 50% rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform, driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user.  With many retail outlets closed, demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally. Gaming laptops revenue accelerated to its fastest year-on-year growth in 6 quarters. We are working with our OEMs, channel partners to meet the growing needs of the professionals and students engaged in working, learning and playing at home. In early April, our global OEM partners announced a record new 100 NVIDIA GeForce-powered laptops with availability starting in Q1 and the most to ship in Q2. These laptops are the first to use our high-end GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs, which have been available for desktop since last summer.  In addition, OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $999, a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX, including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities. These launches are well-timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate.  The global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA Nintendo Switch and our console business, driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft, the world's most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube. Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections. Light that reflects, refracts and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog. Reviews for it are off the charts. Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner, and PC World said it was glorious to behold.  Our RTX technology stands apart, not only with our 2-year lead in ray tracing but with its use of AI to speed up and enhance games using the Tensor Core silicon on our RTX class GPUs. We introduced the next version of our AI algorithm called Deep Learning Super Sampling. In real time, DLSS 2.0 can fill the missing bits from every frame, doubling performance. It represents a major step function from the original, and it can be trained on nongaming-specific images, making it universal and easy to implement.  The value and momentum of our RTX GPUs continue to grow. We have a significant upgrade opportunity over the next year with the rise and tide of RTX-enabled games, including major blockbusters like Minecraft and Cyberpunk. Let me also touch on our game streaming service, GFN, which exited beta this quarter. It gives gamers access to more than 650 games with another 1,500 in line to get onboarded. These include Epic Games, Fortnite, which is the most played game on GFN; and other popular titles such as CONTROL, Destiny 2 and League of Lighting in the fall. Since launching in February, GFN has added 2 million users around the world, with both sign-ups and hours of gameplays boosted by stay-at-home measures. GFN expands our market reach to the billions of gamers with underpowered devices. It is the most publisher-friendly, developer-friendly game streaming service with the greatest number of games and the only one that supports ray tracing.  Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue was $307 million, up 15% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated in Q1 driven by laptop workstations and Turing adoption.  We are seeing continued momentum in our ecosystem for RTX ray tracing. We now have RTX support for all major rendering visualization and design software packages, including Autodesk Maya, Dassault's CATIA, Pixar's RenderMan, Chaos Group's V-Ray and many others. Autodesk has announced that the latest release of VRED, its automotive 3D visualization software, supports NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This enables designers to take advantage of RTX to produce more like-life designs in a fraction of the time versus CPU-based systems. Over 45 leading creative and design applications now take advantage of RTX, driving a sustained upgrade opportunity for Quadro-powered systems while also expanding their reach.  We see strong demand in verticals, including health care, media and entertainment and higher education, among others. Higher health care demand was fueled in part by COVID-19 related research at Siemens, Oxford and Caption Health. Caption Health received FDA clearance for an update to its AI-guided ultrasound, making it easier to perform diagnostics-quality cardiac ultrasounds. And in media and entertainment, demand increased as companies like Disney deployed remote workforce initiatives.  Turning to automotive and robotic autonomous machines. Automotive revenue was $155 million, down 7% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. The automotive industry is seeing a significant impact from the pandemic, and we expect that to affect our revenue in the second quarter as well, likely declining about 40% from Q1.  Despite the near-term challenges, our important work continues. We believe that every machine that moves someday will have autonomous capabilities. During the quarter, Xpeng introduced the P7, an all-electric sports sedan with innovative Level 3 automated driving features, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. Our open, programmable, software-defined platform enables Xpeng to run its proprietary software while also delivering over-the-air updates for new driving features and capabilities. Production deliveries of the P7 with NVIDIA DRIVE begin next month.  Our Ampere architecture will power our next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE platform called Orin, delivering more than 6x the performance of Xavier Solutions and 4x better power efficiency. With Ampere scalability, the DRIVE platform will extend from driverless robotaxis all the way down to in windshield driver assistant systems sipping just a few watts of power. Customers appreciate the top-to-bottom platform all based on a single architecture, letting them build one software-defined platform for every vehicle in their fleet.  Lastly, in the area of robotics, we announced that BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA as a robotics platforms to automate their factories, utilizing logistic robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies.  Turning to data center. Quarterly revenue was a record $1.14 billion, up 80% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Announced last week, the A100 is the first Ampere architecture GPU. Although just announced, A100 is in full production, contributed meaningful to Q1 revenue and demand is strong. Overall, data center demand was solid throughout the quarter. It was also broad-based across hyperscale and vertical industry customers as well as across workloads, including training, inference and high-performance computing. We continue to have solid visibility into Q2.  The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over our 8 generations of GPUs, boosting performance by up to 20x over its predecessor. It is exceptionally versatile, serving as a universal accelerator for the most important high-performance workloads, including AI training and inference as well as data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.  Beyond its leap performance and versatility, the A100 introduces new elastic computing technologies that make it possible to bring rightsized computing power to every job. A multi-instance GPU capability allows each A100 to be partitioned into as many as 7 smaller GPU instances. Conversely, multiple A100 interconnected by our third-generation NVLink can operate as one giant GPU for ever larger training tasks. This makes the A100 ideal for both training and for inference. The A100 will be deployed by the world's leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.  We launched and shipped the DGX A100, our third-generation DGX and the most advanced AI system in the world. The DGX A100 is configurable from 1 to 56 independent GPUs to deliver elastic software-defined data center infrastructure for the most demanding workloads from AI training and inference to data analytics.  We announced two products for edge AI: the EGX A100 for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers; and the EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers. Supported by full AI optimized cloud, native and secure software, the EGX platform is built for AI computing at the edge. With the EGX, hospitals, retail stores, farms and factories can securely carry out real-time processing of the massive amounts of data streaming from trillions of edge sensors. NVIDIA EGX makes it possible to securely, deploy and manage and update fleets of servers remotely. EGX is also ideal for the massive computational challenge of 5G networks, which we are working on with our partners like Ericsson and Mavenir.  Additionally, we announced CUDA 11 and other important software harnessing the A100's performance and universality to accelerate three of the most complex and fast-growing workloads: recommendation systems, conversational AI and data science.  First, NVIDIA Merlin is a deep recommender application framework that enables developers to quickly build state-of-the-art recommendation systems, leveraging our pretrained models. With billions of users and trillions of items on the Internet, deep recommendators are the critical engine powering virtually every internet service.  Second, NVIDIA Jarvis is a GPU-accelerated application framework that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy and run end-to-end real-time conversational AI applications that understand terminology unique to each company and its customers using both vision and speech. Demand for these applications are surging. Amid the shift to working from home, telemedicine and remote learning.  And third, in the field of data science and data analytics, we announced that we are bringing end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark, an analytics engine for big data processing that uses more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide. Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark pipeline, from extracting, transforming and loading the data to training to inference, delivers the performance and the scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI. Adobe has achieved a 7x performance improvement and a 90% cost savings in an initial test using GPU-accelerated data analytics with Spark.  Our accelerated computing platform continues to gain momentum, underscored by the tremendous success of GTC Digital, our annual GPU technology conference, which shifted this spring to an online format. More than 55,000 online developers and AI research registered for the online event, which includes hundreds of hours of free content from AI practitioners and industry experts who leverage NVIDIA's platforms.  Our ecosystem is now 1.8 million developers strong. Times like these truly test a computing platform's metal in the utility it brings to scientist racing for solutions. Researchers around the world are deploying our GPU computing platform in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists are combining AI simulation to detect changes in pneumonia cases, sequence, the virus and seek effective biomolecular compounds for a vaccine or treatment.  The first breakthrough came from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and National Institute of Health, who used the GPU-accelerated application to create the first 3D atomic scale map of virus using NVIDIA GPUs. This was followed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who screened 8,000 compounds to identify 77 promising drug targets using the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit, which is powered by more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs.  The V100 GPUs at Oak Ridge are in high demand as they can analyze 17 million compound protein combinations in a day. They'll help understand the virus spread pattern, the University of California, San Diego, researchers ported their microbiomic analysis software to GPUs in the San Diego supercomputing cluster of 500x analysis speed up from what some people are more susceptible to the virus.  Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins was 65.1% and non-GAAP was 65.8%, up sequentially and year-on-year, primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $821 million, up 10% and 9% year-on-year, respectively. Q1 GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 130% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.80, up 105% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $909 million.  Before I turn to the outlook, let me make a few comments on our Mellanox acquisition. Beyond the strong strategic and cultural fit that Jensen has discussed, Mellanox has exceptionally strong financial profile. The company reported revenue of $429 million in its March quarter, accelerating to 40% year-on-year growth, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the mid- to high 60% range. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing.  With that, let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox. We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19. We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40% on a sequential basis and Pro Viz to decline sequentially. In gaming, while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores, we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-tail channels. Overall, the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict, given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy. Overall, we expect second quarter revenue to be $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%. The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue. We are providing this breakout to help with comparability between Q1 and Q2. But going forward, it will become an integrated part of our data center market platform.  GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are nonrecurring.  GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion, and $1.04 billion, respectively. The sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. For the full year, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs also influence.  GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an increase of approximately $50 million and $45 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.  New this quarter, we have also posted an investor presentation summarizing our results and key highlights. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. Next Thursday, May 28, we will webcast a presentation and Q&A with Jensen on our recent product announcement moderated by Evercore. We will also be at Cowen's TMT Conference on May 27; Morgan Stanley's Cloud Secular Winners Conference on June 1; BoFa's Technology Conference on June 2; Needham's Fourth Automotive Technology Conference on June 3 and Nasdaq Investor Conference on June 16.  Operator, we will now open for questions. Can you please poll for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Congratulations on a solid quarter. Colette, I'm curious of your commentary around visibility in the data center side, that that's comments over the last couple of quarters, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to maybe what it was last quarter? And how do we think about the visibility in the context of trends maybe into the back half of the calendar year.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Will, for the question. You are correct. We have indicated a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see improved visibility after we came out of the digestion period in the prior overall fiscal year. As we move into Q2, we still have visibility and solid visibility into our Q2 results for overall data centers. So at this time, I'd say they are relatively about the same of what we had seen going into the Q1 period. And we think that is a true indication of their excitement about our platform and most particularly our excitement regarding A100, and that's launched and its additional products.  Now regarding the second half of the year, as you know, we have seen broad-based growth in both the hyperscale and the vertical industries, both of them in terms of at record levels. In our Q1 results. And we see in terms of inferencing continuing to grow as well, as well as we're also expanding in terms of edge AI. Our strong demand of the A100 products, including the Delta Board, but also in terms of our DGXs, was just starting an initial ramp. However, we do guide only 1 quarter at a time. So it's still a little bit too early for us to give a true certainty in terms of the macro situation that's in front of us. But again, we feel very good about the demand for A100.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: I first wanted to follow-up on your gaming commentary. You sort of mentioned a couple of offsets. COVID potentially still a headwind, e-tail or tailwind and maybe offsetting each other. Were you trying to suggest that those did offset completely and gaming was kind of flattish into Q2? Because I know it has a typical seasonal pattern switches typically up. I guess what were you trying to say with those kind of factors? And what are the kinds of things we should be thinking about when it comes to seasonality, Colette, into Q2 around that business segment?\nColette Kress: So let me start, and I'll see if Jensen also wants to add on to it. I think you're talking about our sequential between Q1 and Q2. Some of the...\nStacy Rasgon: Yes. That's right.\nColette Kress: Right. Some of the pieces that we had seen related to COVID-19 in Q1 may carry over into Q2. COVID-19, in fact, had an impact in terms of our retail channels as well as our iCafes. However, as we discussed, efficiently, moved to overall e-tail. We have normally been seasonally down in desktop between Q1 and Q2, and that will likely happen. But we do see the strength in terms of laptops and overall consoles as we move for Q1 to Q2. So in summary, we do expect grow sequentially between Q1 and Q2 for our overall gaming business. And I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has additional commentary.\nJensen Huang: No, that was great. That was fantastic.\nStacy Rasgon: Yes. I guess just to follow up on that, though, if it's growing. I mean like in prior years, we've seen it grow like very strong double digits. Obviously, the mix of the business was different back then. But do you think that the kind of -- I mean are we thinking kind of it's up somewhat? You don't -- is there any chance that it could be up like on -- for what we've seen in terms of like typical levels in the past? Like can you give us any sense of magnitude, that would be really helpful?\nColette Kress: Yes. I think when we think about that sequential growth, we'll probably be in the low -- moving up to probably the mid-single digits in terms of -- that's what our guidance right now, and we'll just have to see how the quarter goes.\nStacy Rasgon: Yes. That's very helpful.\nJensen Huang: Stacy, the thing that I would add is this. I would say, I think the guidance is exactly what Colette mentioned. But if you look at the big picture, there's a few dynamics that are working really well in our favor. First, of course, is that RTX and ray tracing is just the home run. Minecraft was phenomenal. We have 33 games in the pipe that has already been announced or shipping. Just about every game developers signed on to RTX and ray tracing, and I think it's a foregone conclusion that this is the next generation. This is the way computer graphics is going to be in the future. And so I think RTX is a home run.  The second, the notebooks that we create is just doing great. We got 100 notebooks in gaming. We have 75 notebooks designed for either mobile workstations or what we call NVIDIA studio for designers and creators. And the timing was just perfect. With everybody needing to stay at home, the ability to have a mobile gaming platform and a mobile workstation, it was just perfect timing. And then, of course, you guys know quite well that our Nintendo Switch is doing fantastic. There are the Top 3 games in the world. The top games in the world today are Fortnite, Minecraft and Animal Crossing. All 3 games are NVIDIA platforms. And so I think we have all the dynamics working in our favor. And then we just got to see how it turns out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: I wanted to ask about the rollout of Ampere how quickly does that roll in the various segments between hyperscale as well as on the DGX side as well as on the HPC side. And is it a smooth transition? Is there -- I remember when you launched Volta, there was a little bit of a transitional pause. Just can you tell us how you see that ramping up with the different customer segments?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot, Joe. So first of all, taking a step back. Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers. It wasn't the case when we first launched Volta. If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way, and it was really focused on training. It was focused on training and high-performance computing. We didn't come until later with the inference version called T4.  But over the course of the last 5 years, we've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers. If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive. Deep learning is now pervasive. The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense. It didn't used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric. But today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs. The number of workloads that we've accelerated since in the last 5 years have expanded tremendously, whether it's imaging or video or conversational AI or deep recommender systems that probably unquestionably, at this point, the most important machine learning model in the world. And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse.  And so that's really -- that's contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere. When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center, it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it. They have a large amount of workload that's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. And as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation. We're forward compatible or backwards compatible. Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100. And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth. On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter. It was sequentially up. And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment. A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business.  All the way out to the edge, which had a great quarter. Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it's a very small part of the high-performance computing. But that's also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers. And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown. The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion. And so I think we're ramping into a very receptive market with a really fantastic -- with a really fantastic product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Just a quick clarification. Colette, 66% kind of the new baseline for gross margin? And then the question, Jensen, for you, is give us a sense for how much inference as a workload and payer as a product are expected to contribute? I'm just curious where you are in terms of growing in the inference and edge AI market? And where are we kind of in the journey of Ampere penetration?\nColette Kress: So let me start on the first question regarding the gross margin and our gross margin as we look into Q2. We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%. This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that. The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox. Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well. But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward. However, it's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go. But we're very pleased with the overall guidance right now at 66% for Q2.\nJensen Huang: Accelerated computing is just at the beginning of its journey. If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments. First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI. Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product. When you're watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song. All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend. All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today. It's the reason why they're collecting so much data. The more data they can collect, the more they could predict your preference, and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet.  It used to be largely based on CPU approaches. But going forward, it's all based on deep learning approaches. The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics. And so this is very, very big deal. And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping. Second is cloud. And as you know, cloud is a $100 billion market segment of it today, growing about 40% into $1 trillion opportunity. Cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen.  The two powers that is really -- the force -- the two forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing. We're perfectly, perfectly positioned to benefit from these two powerful forces. So the second is cloud computing. And that journey is -- has a long ways to go. Then the third is industrial edge. In the future, today -- it's not the case today. But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry. And whether it's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry. And there'll be trillions of sensors, and they'll be connected to little micro data centers. And those data centers will be in the millions. They'll be distributed all over the edge.  And that journey has just barely started. We announced 3 very important partners in 3 domains. And they're the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI. We announced Walmart for smart retail. We announced the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest mail sorting service and logistics service. And then we announced this last quarter, BMW, who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics, automated factory of the future. And so these 3 applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into. And that is just really at its early stages. And so I think it's fair to say that we're really well positioned in the 2 fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence. And the segments that it's going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets. Hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI.\nOperator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: I guess if I could ask two. Colette, can you help us with what you think the growth rate for Mellanox could look like in calendar '20? And then Jensen, a bigger picture question for you and really not specific to health care, more broad-based. But how do you think about the long-lasting impact of COVID on worldwide demand for AI?\nColette Kress: C.J., can you help me? You cut out in the middle of your sentence to me. Can you repeat the first part of it for me?\nChristopher Muse: No, sorry about that. I'm curious if you could provide a little handholding on what we should think about for growth for Mellanox in calendar '20?\nColette Kress: At this time, it's a little early for us. And as you know, we generally just go 1 quarter out, and we're excited to bring the Mellanox team on board so we can start beginning the future of building products together. For the overall margin, their overall performance over the last couple of quarters, they had a great last year. They had a great March quarter as well. And we're just going to have to stay tuned to see equally with them what the second half of the year looks for them. Okay?\nJensen Huang: Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. This pandemic is really quite tragic, and it's reshaping industries and markets. And I think it's going to be structural. I think it's going to remain. And I think your question is really good because now it's a good time to think about where to double down. There's a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I say it, it'll be very sensible. The first is that the world's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud, that is going to accelerate. Every single company can't afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient. And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is going to provide them the resilience they need. And so that's one.  And when the world moves and accelerates into this $1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation, which is now $100 billion into that journey, it's growing 40% a year, I wouldn't be surprised to see that accelerate. And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that. The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system. The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar. And yet in the future, our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable. It's going to be infectious disease. And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods? And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company. We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day.  And that's what you need to do. You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP. And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring. And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up. National labs are going to be gearing up. The third part is AI and robotics. We're going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely. NVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs. And without those robots helping us in our labs, we'll have a hard time getting our work done. And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak. All kinds of robotics applications are being dreamed up right now to help society forward in the case of another outbreak.  And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people work from home, it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games. I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society. And so these are some of the trends, I would say. I would say cloud computing, AI. I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay. And these dynamics are really good for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had one for Colette and then one for Jensen as well, if I may. Colette, I wanted to come back to the gross margin question. You're guiding July essentially flat sequentially, despite what I'm guessing is better mixed with non-ops coming in and automotive guided down 40% sequentially. I guess the question is, what are some of the offsets that are pulling down gross margins in the current quarter? And sort of related to that, how should we be thinking about the cadence and OpEx going forward, given the 6-month pull in that you guys talked about on the compensation side? And then one quick one for Jensen. I was hoping you could comment on the current trade landscape between the U.S. and China. I feel like you guys shouldn't be impacted in a material way directly nor indirectly. But at the same time, given the critical role you play in scientific computing, I can sort of see a scenario where some people may claim that you guys contribute to efforts outside of the U.S. So if you can kind of speak on that -- speak to that, that will be helpful.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Toshiya, for your question. So regarding our gross margins in the second quarter, our second quarter guide at 66% is up sequentially from even a record level in terms of what we had in terms of Q1. This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically, when we transition to a new architectures, margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the onset but tend to kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower. But also, we're going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles, which may offset those two. But overall, there's nothing structural to really highlight other than our mix in business and the ramp of Ampere and its transition.\nJensen Huang: Let's see, the trade tension. We've been living in this environment for some time, Toshiya. And as you know, the trade tension has been in the background for coming up on a year, probably gotten longer. And China's high-performance computing systems are largely based on Chinese electronics anyhow. And so that's -- I think our condition won't materially change going forward.\nColette Kress: So Toshiya, let me respond to your second question that you had for me, which was regarding to our OpEx and our decision to pull forward our overall local into Q2. This is something that we've normally done later in the year. We felt it was prudent during the current COVID-19. Although our employees are quite safe. We just wanted to make sure that their family members also were safe and had the opportunity to have cash upfront. It is about a couple of months, about 4 months earlier than normal, and it is incorporated in our guidance for Q2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis: A question coming back to the A100. I'm trying to understand how this kind of fits into the evolution of your solution set over time and the evolution of the demand for the applications. Is -- and I guess if I think about it going back, you had a solution, which is largely training based. And then you kind of introduced solutions that were targeted more inferencing. And now you have a solution, it sounds to my understanding that it solves both inferencing and training efficiently. And so I guess I'm wondering is 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line, is this part of the kind of general purpose computing or acceleration framework that you had talked about in the past, Jensen, where Ampere is kind of like an Ampere-class product? Or is this -- would you still -- should we still expect to see inferencing-specific solutions in the market and then training-specific solutions and then an Ampere solution for a different class application? If you could provide a framework for thinking about Ampere in those context, I think that would be helpful.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks for the call, Mark. Good Question. I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it. There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time. The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training. Deep learning training. And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up. It's like a supercomputer architecture. It's like a -- it's like a weather simulation architecture. You're trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up.  And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms. And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs. And so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals. Cloud renting was really quite ideal. And then we started to get into inference, and we're on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0.  Along the way, we've been able to accelerate more and more. And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that's out there. And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called [indiscernible], reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day. It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks. And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine. Scale out, it's for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds. And so notice, I've said 3 different architecture in a data center today. Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100. And so the ability to predict workload is so hard, and therefore, the utilization of these systems will be spiky.  And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things. So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history. I mean I don't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x. And it's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward. The second, it's the first architecture that is unified. We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center. From data processing, it's called ETO; the engine, which many of you probably know, it's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data. It used to be Hadoop, but now it's Spark. Spark is used all over the world, 16,000 customers.  We finally have the ability to accelerate that. And then it's -- Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference. And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload. And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic. You could reconfigure it. You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs. Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta. I mean it's really quite extraordinary. And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it's elastic. You could use in the cloud, you could use a for inference, you could use it for training. And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about. And now you could have 1 acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Actually I had two, I guess, Jensen, first for you. Just on the data center business, things have been very strong recently. Obviously, there's always concerns that customers are pulling in CapEx, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility into July. But I guess last time, most folks also thought that your kind of attrition really was so low that you would be immune into any digestion, but that wasn't the case. So I guess I'm wondering, if things are different now with A100 and whatnot, but my question is how do you handicap your ability to this time, maybe get through any digestion on the CapEx side? And then I guess, second question, Colette, stock comp had been running like 220 a quarter, and the guidance implies that it goes to like 460 a quarter. So it goes up a lot. Is that all executive retention? And is that sort of the right level as you look into 2021?\nJensen Huang: Colette, did you want to handle that first? And then I'll do the...\nColette Kress: Sure. So let me help you out on the overall GAAP adjustments, so the delta between our GAAP OpEx and our non-GAAP OpEx. If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses. Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation. We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox, and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items. So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox. There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox. But for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for three quarters, which is influencing the stock-based compensation.\nJensen Huang: Tim, there are several differences between our condition then and our condition today. So the first -- the first difference is the diversity of workload we now accelerate. Back then, we were early in our inference. We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning. And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video.  The natural language understanding the conversational AI to now a gigantic movement towards deep recommender systems. And so the number of different models that are being trained is growing. The size of the models are gigantic. Recommendation systems are gigantic. They're training on models that are hundreds. The data sizes, hundreds of terabytes. Terabytes, hundreds of terabytes. And it would take tens of -- hundreds of servers to hold all of the data that is needed to train these recommender systems. And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models. We didn't inference recurring elements at a time, which is probably the most important model today. Text language models, speech models are all recurrent, Euronet models. And so those models were early for us at the time. So number one is the diversity of workload. The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing.  I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition. From where we are today, it's only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry. It's going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting. We're also much more diversified out of the clouds. At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning. And today, hyperscale only represents about half. And so we've diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries. And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference. And as I mentioned earlier, we're working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so I think the conditions are a little different. And then what I would say lastly is Ampere. I mean we are -- we've ramped a few weeks. Even though it was quite significant, it was a great ramp. The demand is fantastic. It is the best ramp we've ever had. The demand is the strongest we've ever had in data centers. And we're starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp. And so -- those are some of the differences. I think the conditions are very different.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Jensen, the team has showed the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, like, for example, when you guys move from Volta DGX-1 to Volta DGX-2, you guys didn't change the GPU chipset. But by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things, you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance per GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center skilled implementation, how does Mellanox' Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Great. Thanks a lot, Harlan. I appreciate the question. So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it's really successful. People love it. It's the most advanced AI instrument in the world. If you're a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument. And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have. And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking. High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand. And the reason for that is because the problems we're trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is. And so it has to be distributed.  And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable. There's reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind. And so -- and it's not just about the link speed. It's not mostly. I mean we just have a deep appreciation for software. It's a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design. And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class. And that's the reason why they're in 60% of the world's supercomputers. That's why they're in 100% of the AI supercomputers. And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none. Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up. And you're absolutely right. Now the question is why scale out? And the reason for that is this.  This is the reason why they're doing so well. The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center. That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes. And you could rank it however you desire. And these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it's a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center. And because it's broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again. And that's the reason why they're doing so well. By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously. And so it's the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter. It's the reason why they've been growing 27% per year.  And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they're low latency, they're incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it's Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases. And so they're -- it's a really fantastic stack. And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node. The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center. In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center. It's so incredible. It's just utterly incredible. You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center. And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security.  Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing. And so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch. And then the second thing is we'd like to be able to innovate across the entire stack. You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks. And the reason for that is because software creates markets. You can't create new markets like we're talking about, whether it's computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI. All of that requires software stacks. It takes software to create markets. And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that. They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack. And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers. And so we're super, super excited about the team. And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack.\nOperator: Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.\nWilliam Stein: Jensen, I'd like to focus on something you said. I think it was in one of your earlier responses, you said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I'm sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely, let's say, REX and REXs CPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that?\nJensen Huang: Yes. I appreciate the question. And this, for computer architecture geeks and people who follow history, you know well that in the entire history of time, there are only two computing architectures that has made it so far, which is one of them is x86. The other one's ARM in any reasonable way. And if you get an ARM computer, you get an x86 computer, you can program it. And in fact, there's no such thing as an accelerated computing platform until we came along. And today, we're the only computing -- accelerated computing platform that you could really largely address. We're in every cloud. We're in every computer company. We're in every country.  We have every single size, and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics. This journey took 20-some-odd years. Inside our company, it took 20-some-odd years. And the we've been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company. And we made a general purpose. We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg, C for graphics, and then it became CUDA. And we've been working on accelerated computing for quite a long time. And I think at this point, it's a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and is well beyond it. The number of developers this year that support -- that we supported was almost 2 million developers around the world, and it's growing what appears to be exponentially. And so I think accelerated computing is now well established. NVIDIA-accelerated computing is well established. It's common sense, and people who are designing data centers expect to put accelerated computing in it. The question is how much? How much accelerated computing do you use? And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it?  And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the three pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI. And the other two pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data. And so these three ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training. But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models. And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system. It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way. It's the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything. And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer's perspective.  On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there's no way they could possibly make money. And so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company. And that engine is gigantic. It is just a gigantic engine. And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics. The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference. So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies. And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is. But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration. And so I'm looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all the reasons that I just mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Just two quick ones. Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as OpEx, but just given the full year guide, there's sort of a lot to unpack. And you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there's an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there's Mellanox and how you're thinking about investing in that asset. I guess I'm just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on OpEx as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities? Or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you're thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well? How do I understand that? And then, Jensen, just a quick one for you. It kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like health care. But in the other verticals, has the sort of shelter in place kind of hurt engagement? And could we actually come out of COVID with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets?\nColette Kress: Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Let's start from the first perspective on the overall OpEx for the year. We've guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees. We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct. We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me, not this quarter, this year. And that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings, and you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly though, we are investing in our business. We see some great opportunities. You've seen some good results from our investment, and there's more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses. So there's nothing different structurally, but just this onset of Mellanox and are investing together, I think, we'll produce long-term great results.\nJensen Huang: And as usual, John, you know that we're investing into the IT industry's largest opportunities, cloud computing and AI. And then after these 2 opportunities is edge AI. And so we're looking down the fairway with some pretty extraordinary opportunities. But as usual, we're thoughtful about the rate of investment, and we're well-managed. And NVIDIA's leadership team are excellent managers, and you could count on us to continue to do that. Simona, what was John's question? Could you just give me one hint? I haven't...\nJohn Pitzer: Just the idea of engagement levels in verticals, just with shelter in place. Has that hampered...\nJensen Huang: Oh yes. Right. Yes, right. Yes, right. A few -- some of the industries have been affected. We already mentioned automotive industry. The automotive industry has been grounded to a halt. Manufacturing hasn't largely stopped. And you saw that in our guidance. We expect automotive to be down 40% quarter-to-quarter. It's not going to remain that way. It's going to come back. And nobody knows what level is going to come back to you and how long, but it's going to come back. And there's no question in my mind that the automotive industry, they're hunkered down right now, but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. They have to, or they'll be extinct. It's not possible not to have autonomous capability in the future of everything that moves.  Not so that it could just completely drive without you. That a nice benefit, too. But mostly because of safety and comfort and just a joy of what seems like the car is reading your mind. And of course, you're still responsible for driving it and -- but it just seems to be coasting down the road, reading your mind and helping you. And so I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer, Tesla, is enjoying. And the industry is going to go after it. The future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies. And they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets. And so they're going to go after it. And so this is -- I'm certain that this is going to come back. And well, I have every confidence is going to come back. And let's see, the energy sectors are -- have been impacted. The retail sector has been impacted. There's -- those aren't large industries for us.  The impact in some of the industries is accelerating their focus in robotics. Like, for example, on the one hand, BMW has obviously impacted in manufacturing, which is the reason why they're moving so rapidly towards robotics. They have to figure out a way to get robotics into their factories. So same thing with retail. You're going to see a lot more robotic support in retail, you're going to see a lot more robotic support in warehouses, in logistics. And so during this time, when the market -- when the industry is disrupted and impacted, it allows the market leaders to really lean into investing into the future. And so when they come back, they'll be coming back stronger than ever.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay: Two different topics, Jensen. Well, first of all, congrats on Ampere. It's a heck of a product. The first question...\nJensen Huang: Thank you, Matt. I'm so proud.\nMatthew Ramsay: The first question is it might have been a little bit hard to talk when the deal was pending about this topic, but now that it's closed, maybe you could talk a little bit about opportunities to innovate on and customize the Mellanox stack and the balance of having an industry standard. And the second one is E3 canceled, Computex moved around. At the same time, there's obviously stay-at-home gaming demand. Just how you think about gaming product, launch logistics? And any comments on there would be really helpful.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt. I appreciate your questions. I'll go backwards because it's kind of cool. On the one hand, I do miss that we can't engage the developers face to face. It's just so much fun. GTC is doing all their work and the hundreds of papers that are presented, I learned so much each time. And frankly, I really enjoyed the analyst meeting that we have. And so there's all kinds of stuff that I missed about the physical GTC, but here's the amazing thing. We had almost -- the GTC kitchen keynote. I did it from my kitchen just right behind me, and the kitchen keynote has been viewed almost 4 million times. And the video is incredible. And so I think our reach is -- could be quite great. And so I'm not too -- we've got an amazing marketing team, and we just -- we've got great people. They're going to find a way to reach our gamers. And whenever we launch something next, you know that gamers are going to be and our customers are going to be -- our end markets are going to be really excited to see it. And so I'm very confident that we're going to do just fine. Matt, what was the question before? I should never do backwards.\nMatthew Ramsay: Just the industry standard versus customization of Mellanox opportunity.\nJensen Huang: I see. Okay. Yes. There's -- we work so closely with Mellanox over the years. And on the day that we announced GTC, you could see the number of products that we have working together. The product synergies are really incredible, and the product synergies include a lot of software development that went in and a lot of architectural development that went in. DGX comes with 9 Mellanox, Matt, as I mentioned. If you look at our data center, we ship -- before we ship DGXs to the customers, we ship it to our own engineers. And the reason for that is because every single product in our company has AI in it. From Jarvis to Metropolis to Merlin to DRIVE to Clara to Isaac to -- right? All of our products has AI in it, and we're accelerating frameworks for all of the AI industry.  And Ampere comes with a brand-new numerical format called Tensor Float 32. And TF32 is just a fantastic medium medical format and the performance is incredible. And we had to get it integrated in with the industry standard frameworks. And now Tensor Float comes standard with Tensor Flow -- with TF -- NVIDIA TF32, and PyTorch come standard with TF32. And so we need our own large-scale data center. And so the first customer we ship to was ourselves. And then we started shipping as quickly as we could to all of the customers. You saw that in our data center, in our supercomputer. We have 170 -- 170 state-of-the-art, brand-new Mellanox switches. And almost 1,500 -- 200 gigabit per second Mellanox mix. And 15 kilometers of cables, fiber optic cables. And that is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world today, and it's based on Ampere.  And so we have a great deal of work that we did there together. We announced our first edge computer between us and Mellanox in this new card, we call it the EGX A100. It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox' CX-6 Dx, which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing. It's incredible security and has a single route of trust, and it's virtualized. And so basically, we -- this EGX A100, when you put it into a standard center x86 server, turns that server into a cloud computer in a box. The entire capability of a cloud, of a state-of-the-art cloud, which is cloud native, it's secure, it has incredible AI processing, it's now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box. The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable. And so you could see all the different product synergies that we have in working together. We could have done Spark acceleration without the collaboration with Mellanox. They worked on this piece of networking software called UCX. We worked on nickel together. It made possible the infrastructure for large-scale distributor computing. I mean just the list goes on and on and on. And so we -- the two teams have great chemistry. The culture -- it's a great culture fit. I love working with them. And right out of the chute, you saw all of the great product synergies that are made possible because of the combination.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: It's coming. Let me just -- thank you. We had a great and busy quarter. With our announcements, we highlighted several initiatives. First, computing is moving to data center scale where computing and networking go hand in hand. The acquisition of Mellanox gives us deep expertise and scale to innovate from end to end. Second, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Our Ampere generation offers several breakthroughs. It is the largest ever generational leap 20x in training and inference throughput; the first unified acceleration platform for data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, training and inference; and the first elastic accelerator that can be configured for scale-up applications like training to scale-out applications like inference. Ampere is fast, it's universal and it's elastic. It's going to re-architect the modern data center. Third, we are opening large new markets with AI software application framework, such as Clara for health care, DRIVE for autonomous vehicles, Isaac for robotics, Jarvis for conversational AI, Metropolis for edge IoT, AERIAL for 5G and Merlin with the very important recommender systems. And then finally, we have built up multiple engines of accelerated computing growth. RTX computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and data center scale computing from cloud to edge. I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We had an excellent quarter with revenue up 53% year-on-year to $7.6 billion. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Full year revenue was a record $26.9 billion, up 61%, compounding the prior year's growth of 53%.  Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.4 billion rose 6% sequentially and was up 37% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 61%. Gaming has become the top entertainment medium that continues to show strong momentum. Just last month, Steam hit a record 28 million concurrent users, up 50% in two years. Record desktop revenue in the quarter was led by our growth in our GeForce RTX 30 Series products with continued strength in the high end. At CES, we announced the RTX 3050 GPO, which hit retail in late January, bringing NVIDIA RTX and AI technologies to more mainstream audiences. Laptop gaming revenue also set a record, driven by the ramp of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti GPUs, which were also announced at CES. These leverage our fourth-generation Max-Q technology to enable quiet thin and light gaming laptops. All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA and tier architecture RTX 30 Series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators driving the future of design, innovation and virtual world.  In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 Series GPUs, Studio laptops future support for NVIDIA software with Omniverse, Tundus and Broadcast. Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low. NVIDIA RTX ecosystem continues to expand with over 30 new RTX games and applications added this quarter, including blockbuster hit like Battlefield 2042, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty: Vanguard and God of War. In addition, several new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low-latency impact.  Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, so we have limited visibility into how much of this impacts our overall GPU demand. Nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are light cache rate to help direct GeForce supply to gamers. Cryptomining processor revenue was $24 million, which is included in OEM and other.  We continue to expand the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming ecosystem with new hit titles, including EA's Battlefield IV and Battlefield V. At CES, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate GeForce NOW in its smart TVs starting in Q2 of this year. This follows last month's beta release of the GeForce NOW for LG smart TVs. In addition, we teamed up with AT&T to bring GeForce NOW to 5G mobile devices in the U.S. We also added our first GFN data center in Canada.  Moving to pro visualization. Q4 revenue was $643 million was up 11% sequentially and up 109% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $2.1 billion was up 100%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a shift to higher-value workstation and the continued ramp of our NVIDIA healthcare architecture. We believe strong demand is fueled by continued build-outs for hybrid work environment as well as growth in key workloads, including 3D design, AI and rendering. For example, Sony Pictures ImageWorks is using NVIDIA RTX to accelerate ray-tracing for rendering-related applications. Motion is using NVIDIA RTX for AI to assist in predictive maintenance of the vehicles. And Duke Energy is using NVIDIA RTX for AI and VR to map, view and maintain energy facilities.  NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise software entered general availability. And while it's still in early days, customer feedback so far has been very positive, with multiple significant enterprise licensees already signed. In addition to software licenses, Omniverse also drives computing opportunity for NVIDIA RTX in laptops, workstations and on-prem servers and the cloud. Omniverse can be used by individuals for free and by enterprise teams via software subscriptions.  At CES, we made the free version of Omniverse for individual's general availability. Omniverse allows creators with RTX GPUs to connect leading 3D design applications to a single scheme and superset their work with AI and physics. We also announced early access to Omniverse Cloud, which adds one-click capability to collaborate with other artists, whether across the room or across the globe.  For digital twin applications, we announced the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robot platform using Omniverse and securely orchestrated and cloud delivered with the platform optimizes operational efficiency and accelerate deployment from logistics remods. It consists of several NVIDIA AI technologies and SDKs, including data for high-precision mapping, metropolis or situational awareness and reop for real-time route optimization.  Moving to automotive. Q4 revenue was $125 million, declined 7% sequentially and 14% from the year ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our Orion-based product platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1 with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year and momentum building into calendar 2023 [Technical Difficulty]  I will now hand it over to Jensen to provide more color on this morning's automotive news.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. Earlier today, we announced a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly develop and deliver fleets of software-defined cars. Starting in 2025, all new Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles will have next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled software and services built on the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. DRIVE Orin will be the AI computer brain running our DRIVE AV and DRIVE IX software. And the DRIVE Hyperion sensor network will be the central nervous system. This new vehicle architecture will enable a wide spectrum of active safety, automated driving and parking systems. Inside the vehicle, the system will deliver AI features, including driver and occupant monitoring and advanced visualization of the vehicles surroundings. We are very much looking forward to partnering with Thierry Bollor\u00e9, JLR's CEO, and his team to reinvent the future of luxury cars. Our full stack end-to-end approach is a new business model that offers downloadable AV and AI services to the fleet of JLR vehicles with a shared software revenue stream for both companies over the life of the fleet.  This partnership follows the template of our announcement with Mercedes-Benz. Our shared software revenue opportunity with both OEMs will scale with the size of their NVIDIA-powered fleet, which, combined, can exceed 10 million cars over a decade. Colette, back to you.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Jensen. Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.3 billion grew 11% sequentially and 71% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $10.6 billion was up 58%. Data center growth in the quarter was once again led by our compute products on strong demand for NVIDIA AI. Hyperscale and cloud demand was outstanding, with revenue more than doubling year-on-year. Vertical Industries also posted strong double-digit year-on-year growth led by consumer Internet companies.  The flagship NVIDIA A100 GPU continue to drive strong growth. Inference-focused revenue more than tripled year-on-year. Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton and France server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production. Data center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere architecture-based product for fast-growing AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep learning recommendation systems as well as cloud executing.  For example, Block Inc., a global leader in payment, uses conversational AI in its Square Assistant to schedule appointments with customers. These AI models are trained on video GPUs in AWS and perform inference 10x faster on the AWS GP service and on our CPUs.  Social media company Snap used NVIDIA GPUs and Merlin deep recommendator software to improve inference cost efficiency by 50% and decrease latency to 2x. For the third year in a row, industry benchmarks show that NVIDIA AI continues to lead the industry in performance. Along with partners like Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA such records in the latest benchmarks for AI training across 8 popular AI workloads, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and detection. NVIDIA AI was the only platform to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility as well as our performance.  The numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just 2 months, thanks to continuous innovations across the full stack in AI algorithms, optimization tools and system software. Over the past 3 years, they saw performance gains of over 20x powered by advances we have made across our full stack offering GPUs, networks, systems and software.  The leading performance of NVIDIA AI is sought after by some of the world's most technically advanced companies. Meta Platforms unveils its new AI supercomputer research, SuperCluster, with over 6,000 A100 GPUs moved to an NVIDIA -- Meta's early benchmarks showed its system can train large natural language processing models 3x faster and run computer vision jobs 20x faster than the prior system.  In a second phase later this year, the system will expand to 16,000 GPUs that Meta believes will deliver 5x of mixed precision AI performance. In addition to performance at scale, Meta cited extreme reliability, security, privacy and flexibility to handle a wide range of AI models as its key criteria for the system. We continue to broaden the reach and ease the adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries. Our ecosystem of NVIDIA-certified systems expanded with Cisco and Hitachi -- which joined Dell, HewlettPackard Enterprise, Insper, Lenovo and Supermicro, among other sever manufacturers.  We released version 1.1 of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, allowing enterprises to accelerated annual workloads on VMware, on mainstream IT infrastructure as well. And we expanded the number of system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Forrester Research in its evaluation of Enterprise AI infrastructure providers recognized NVIDIA in the top category of leaders. An example of a partner that's helping to expand our reach into enterprise IT is Deloitte, a leading global consulting firm, which has built its center for AI computing on NVIDIA DGX Superpod. At CES, we extended our collaboration to AV development, leveraging our own robust AI infrastructure and Deloitte's team of 5,500 system integration developers and 2,000 data scientists to architect solutions for truly intelligent transportation.  Our networking products posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, driven by exceptional demand across use cases ranging from computing, supercomputing and enterprise to storage. adopters-led growth driven by adoption of our next-generation products and higher-speed deployments. While revenue was gated by supply, we anticipate improving capacity in coming quarters, which should allow us to serve with significant customer demands we're seeing. Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industry seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA.  Now let me turn it back over to Jensen for some comments on Arm.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. Last week, we terminated our efforts to purchase Arm. When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believe that would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide. We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal.  NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before. Our focus is accelerated computing. We are on track to launch our Arm-based CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our 3-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs and DPUs. Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job. And together with partners in the computer industry, offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time.  Back to you, Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Jensen. We're going to turn to our P&L and our outlook. For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Investor Relations lean. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect sequential growth to be driven primarily by Data Center. Gaming will also contribute to growth. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the Arm write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.6 billion. For the fiscal year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses at a similar percent as in fiscal 2022.  GAAP and non-GAAP other operating, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. Non-GAAP tax rate are expected to be 11% and 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.  In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in person on March 7. We will also be hosting a virtual Investor Day on March 22, alongside the GPU Technology Conference. This will follow Jensen's opening keynote, which we invite you to tune into. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 27.  We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs & Company. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen and Colette, I wanted to ask about Data Center. Colette, based on your guidance, you're probably guiding Data Center growth on a year-over-year basis to accelerate into the April quarter. You talked about hyperscale cloud growing more than 2x and enterprise verticals growing strong double digits in the January quarter. Can you kind of speak to the drivers for April and perhaps speak to visibility into the second half of the fiscal year as well in Data Center? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Sure.\nColette Kress: I'll start, and I'll turn it over to Jensen. For Q1, our guidance can include an acceleration of Data Center from where we left in terms of Q4. We will have growth across several of our market platforms within Q1, both Data Center, Gaming and probably a couple of others. But yes, there is expected to be accelerated growth as we move into Q1. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk about the drivers that we see for the quarter and also for the full year.\nJensen Huang: Yes. We have several -- first of all, Toshiya, great to hear from you. We have several growth drivers in data centers. There's hyperscale, public cloud, enterprise core and enterprise edge. We're seeing growth across the entire spectrum. There are several different use cases that are particularly exciting, large language models -- language, understanding models triggered by the invention of transformers, which is probably one of the most important AI models that's been invented in some time. And conversational AI used for customer service, chat bots, a whole bunch of customer service applications. It can be web-based. It could be point-of-sale base. It could be cloud-based.  Recommender systems, deep learning-based recommender systems are making groundbreaking improvements. And cloud graphics, all of the work that we're doing and putting rendering or putting simulations up in the cloud, cloud gaming, Android cloud gaming, are really driving adoption in the cloud. And so many different use cases across all of the different platforms in data centers.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nChristopher Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess another question on the data center side. Curious if you can speak to supply constraints on the wafer side and whether that played a role in terms of capping revenues in the January quarter and how you see that becoming less of a headwind for you as you proceed through the year?\nColette Kress: Thanks, C.J., for the question. I'll start on the data center supply. As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the Data Center business has been supply constrained. We're improving every single day. And we do expect to improve supply each quarter as we enter into fiscal year '23 here. So that is probably the key area within our Data Center. But from time to time, there can be other focused on do -- so I'll turn the rest of the question to Jensen in terms of how about the rest of the year as well.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Colette captured it well. We are supply constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. As you know, our data center product line consists of GPUs and mix, Bluefield DPUs, Quantum and spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GPU board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. And so we have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale, to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry standard servers, commodity servers for enterprise use and supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and quantum switches. And so the application space is quite broad.  We saw demand constrained pretty much across the entire range. Our operations team did a fantastic job this year, both in executing in all of these complicated products, but also in expanding our supply base. We expect supply to improve each and every quarter going forward. And this quarter, this coming quarter, the Q1 -- the April quarter is, based on guidance that Colette just made, is consistent with an increasing supply base. We expect to still be demand constrained, but our supply base is going to increase this quarter, this next quarter and pretty substantially in the second half.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Grace now that the strategy kind of separated from the acquisition of Arm. The -- what are your aspirations there? Is it going to be primarily oriented to the DGX and HX Systems business versus merchant chips? Just how are you thinking about that opportunity long-term?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Joe. We have a multiple-arm projects ongoing in the company from - connected from devices to robotics processors such as the new Orin that's going into autonomous vehicles and robotic systems and industrial automation, robotics and such. Orin is doing incredibly well. It started production. And as we mentioned earlier, it's going to drive an inflection point starting in Q2, but accelerating through Q3 and the several years after as we ramp into all of the electric cars and all of the robotic applications and robotaxis and such.  We also have Arm projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of CPU developments around the Arm architecture. One of the things that's really evolved nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. And it's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. And so you're going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us. And Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. But our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs. If it's an x86 from any vendor. So long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics and such. And so we love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications, and we intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Just on the inventory purchase obligations, I think this was the fourth quarter in a row where you've seen greater than 30% sequential growth and is the first quarter where that number is now eclipsing kind of your quarterly revenue guidance. And so I guess I'm trying to figure out to what extent is this just a reflection of how tight things are across the semi industry? To what extent is this the poker tale of kind of how bullish you are on future demand?  And relative to your commentary, that supply starts to get better throughout the year, should we expect that number to start to level off? Or as the mix moves more to data center and more to longer cycle times, more complicated devices should that number continue to grow?\nJensen Huang: The factors, the drivers that you mentioned in the supply chain, we expanded our supply chain footprint significantly this year to prepare us for both increased supply base and supply availability in each one of the quarters going forward, but also in preparation for some really exciting product launches. As mentioned, Orin ramping into autonomous vehicles is brand new. This is the inflection point of us growing into autonomous vehicles. This is going to be a very large business for us going forward. It was already mentioned, Grace is a brand-new product that has never been on NVIDIA's road map. And we already see great success with customers who love the architecture of it and desperately in need of the type of capability that Grace brings. And this should be a pretty exciting year for new product launches. And so we're preparing for all of that laying the foundation for us to bring all those exciting products to the marketplace.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Obviously, there's a lot more talk from you about software. And I think it's still kind of a little bit of a black box for live investors. And I know, Jensen, that you've talked about software as a medium to basically open up new markets. But I'm wondering maybe if you can sort of quantify how big the software licensing revenue is today and maybe when you might start to break it out like you did data center, which really got the stock moving in a huge, huge way.\nJensen Huang: Yes. NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system to the system software, the acceleration engines and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse.  These are applications that sit on top of system software and are really valuable to the marketplace. The way to think about our software licensing -- so we've always been a software-driven business. But for the very first time, we have packaged licensable software on -- available to customers. The way that we license software for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is per node of server. There's some 20 million, 25 million servers that are installed in the world today in enterprises, not including clouds. We believe that every single server in the future will be running AI software. And we would like to offer an engine that enables enterprises to be able to use the most advanced the most trusted, the most utilized AI engine in the world. And so that is essentially the target market, if you will, for NVIDIA AI.  The NVIDIA Omniverse is targeting -- is designed for creators contributing content to a virtual world and connect it to robots that are contributing to content in a virtual world. And so it's based on connections. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. And those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. And those are -- so the Omniverse business model is per connection per year.  And in the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver, if it's AB software or parking software or cabin-based AI software, whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics of that. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. But basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car.  And so you could imagine, with 10 million cars, with a modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. And so our business opportunity is based on those factors. But our software business really, really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse and DRIVE. And so I watch the spot, I think this is going to be a very significant business opportunity for us, and we look forward to reporting on it.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Jensen, in the past, you mentioned about 10% or so adoption rate for AI among your customer base. I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve that you tend to differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers? And then kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also?\nJensen Huang: Yes. The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. But whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection, in cases of consumer pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI, where people are calling chat bots. But in the future, every website will have a chat bot, every phone number will have a chat bot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, we'll have a chat bot. And so customer service will be heavily, heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's a fast food or a quick service, businesses are going to have chat bots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents.  And so all of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs, computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service.  The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about an AI much, much more so than a recording, which obviously is not intelligent and therefore it's difficult to, if you will, call your manager or call somebody to provide services that they can't. And so the number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. I think we're -- we remain early days in our adoption. It's incredible how fast it has grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. It pretty much says that almost all future software will be written with AI or by AI. And when it's done, it will be an AI. And we see it in all these different industries. And so I'm pretty certain we're in the early innings yet of AI, and this is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known.  With respect to capital, we -- as you know, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process, and we'll go through that, and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth and sustaining our growth and accelerating our growth, and we'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings. We're just delighted to have so much capital. And so just to put it out there.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Can you guys talk about how the launch of the RTX 3050 is going so far? And maybe more broadly, your view of where we are in the product cycle on gaming?\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Michael. Let's see. We -- RTX is an unqualified home run. RTX completely reinvented modern computer graphics. It made -- it brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our processors, but also engage the powerful Tensor for processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. And if not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and of course, cameras and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. And so RTX was a game changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics. And it was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform from Omniverse.  We're about, I think, about 1/3 of the way through upgrading an installed base that is growing. You know that video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. And Steam over the last 2 years has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. And in just the last couple of years, a brand-new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred million dollar business. I think it's close to $1 billion that they're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it.  And so the overall gaming market is growing and it's growing quite nicely. But the thing that, in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire installed base, the growing of our installed base because gaming is growing. There are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. And we now are seeing across the board people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home. In addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is really, really doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. So 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. In live video broadcast video, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. And so 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content, it's actually used now for all forms of digital content creation. And so RTX has all of these different drivers working behind it, and we're definitely in the early innings of RTX.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.\nStacy Rasgon: So you said that the growth in the next quarter is about $450 million, give or take, driven by Data Center. Can you give us some feeling for how that growth is being driven by units versus pricing versus mix and how those drivers might differ between Gaming and Data Center, if at all, for Colette?\nColette Kress: It's really early in the quarter to determine, Stacy, our exact mix that we will have based on the unit and an ASP -- our overall growth quarter-over-quarter going into Q1 will be driven by data center primarily. We will see a little bit of growth there in gaming. I think that's important to understand that even after Q4 holiday moving into Q1, we'll still probably see growth in gaming, which is different in terms of what we've seen seasonally. We will probably have growth in automotive as well sequentially between Q4 and Q1. There are still some areas that are so constrained. We are working again to try and improve that for every quarter going forward, but that's how you should look at our earnings for Q1 primarily from Data Center.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid results and execution. The networking connectivity portfolio addition has been pretty solid for the NVIDIA team, especially in enabling scaling of your GPU systems, improving connectivity bottlenecks in yours and your customers' accelerated compute platforms. So in a year where spending is growing 30%. You've got a strong networking upgrade cycle, which is good for your NIC products and just continued overall good attach rates, if the team can unlock more supply, will the networking connectivity business grow in line or faster than the overall Data Center business this year?  And then for Jensen, have you driven synergies between Mellanox's leadership in networking connectivity? And for example, leveraging their capabilities for your internally developed NVLink connectivity and switching architectures?\nJensen Huang: Yes, absolutely. If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX and DGX Super Pine and the research supercomputer that was just installed in Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving some -- moving computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with Synchronoss and Precision Timing so that we could create Omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space time, these things are just simply not possible. The work that we're doing to bring cloud-native secure multi-tenancy to supercomputing wouldn't have been possible.  The number of innovations, that are countless. And so I am so thrilled with the combination and so through what the work the Mellanox team are doing. We've accelerated road maps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design. BlueField's road map has been accelerated probably by about a year. The switch in -- the quantum switch and the spectrum switch, the SerDes are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet and InfiniBand and NVLink, absolutely the best servers in the world. And so the list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. And so I'm super thrilled with that.  With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. And the reason for that -- the reason for that is twofold. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox, Mellanox is highly heavyweight in the upper end of networking, where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. And so it's sensible that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than the last-generation networking. And Mellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world class.  The second reason is because the areas where the overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast, which related to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. And so those different applications are growing faster than the core. And so it would be sensible that we have the opportunity as we expand our supply base to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes. Jensen, I maybe wanted to expand on some of the things that you were just speaking about in your last answer with respect to the Data Center business. It's not often maybe ever that you have both x86 server vendors having new big platform upgrades in the same year, which will probably happen later this year. There's a lot going on there, PCIe, some CXL stuff. I wonder if you could talk a bit about your Data Center business broadly and what you feel might be memory and I/O constrained currently that these systems might unlock for you both in the cloud and enterprise side, but also in the DGX business.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Matt. The -- there are several bottlenecks, and let me just highlight some of them. One of the largest bottlenecks is memory speed. And memory speed, that's the reason why we use the fastest memories in the world, HBM and GDDR, et cetera, et cetera. We are the largest consumers of the fastest memories in the world and not even by -- there's not -- with no close second that I know. And so our consumption of fast memories is important to the work that we do.  The second is networking performance. It is the reason why we have the fastest networks. It is also the reason why we have the most fastest networks in any system. We will have, for example, 8 InfiniBand at the highest speeds connected right into HGX or DGX server. And so the work that we do in GPU direct memory, RDMA, the work that we do with GPU direct storage, the work that we do with in-network computing and all reductions and moving data around inside the network is absolutely world-class. This is an area that we are just -- I am just incredibly proud.  All of that is so that we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is on CPU and 8 GPUs. And the fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. This year, we expect a transition in PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that. And that's something that we're very good at. And we'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years. And all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world, and we'll take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. But we have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Co.\nRajvindra Gill: Yes. Congrats on the good quarter and guide. Colette, question on the gross margin and to Jensen's point about really creating a software business driven by Omniverse, DRIVE and Enterprise. When you're kind of contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your kind of more of a longer-term margin profile.\nColette Kress: Yes. Thanks for the question on gross margin and the long term. When we think about the long-term gross margin, we have incorporated software in many of our platforms even today, meaning our high-value platforms in data center or [indiscernible] of our business have really helped us with our gross margins to this point, and we've done a really solid job of managing that and the growth over the years. I believe these businesses will continue to be a growing opportunity for us, but now also with the ability to package up -- So as that scales with our Enterprise customers, in the Data center and with our already procured deals, a lot of work we've got a great opportunity in the future and [indiscernible] margin -- so we're going to work on that. We've set the stage for having been able to package it up to be able to sell it separately to create the business model, to create the partners that are helping us sell it. But yes, we do believe this will be a driver in the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, everyone. The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics and some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform optimized across the full stack, architecture for data center scale is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of the NVIDIA operations team as we make substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. And this year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE.  NVIDIA DRIVE is a full stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping and the autonomous driving application service. Our data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics robotaxis, shuttles and trucks. EV companies have selected our Orin chip across the world. And our partnership with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover has opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet.  NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. Today's Internet is 2D and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of Internet will be 3D and AI will be connected to the physical world. We created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse.  We can't wait to share more of our progress at next month's GTC, learn about new chips, new computing platforms, new AI and robotic breakthroughs and the new frontiers of Omniverse. Hear from the technologists of Deloitte, Epic Games, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Pfizer, Sony, Visa, Walt Disney, Zoom and more. This GTC promises to be our most exciting developers conference ever.  We had quite a year, yet nothing makes me more proud than the incredible people who have made NVIDIA one of the best companies to work for and the company where they do their lives' work. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 was an outstanding quarter with revenue of $7.1 billion and year-on-year growth of 50%. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 42% from a year earlier. Demand was strong across the board. While we continued to increase desktop GPU supply, we believe channel inventories remain low. Laptop GPUs also posted strong year-on-year growth, led by increased demand for high-end RTX laptops. NVIDIA RTX technology is driving our biggest ever refresh cycle with gamers, and continues to expand our base with creators. RTX introduced groundbreaking real-time ray tracing and AI-enabled super resolution capabilities, which are getting adopted at an accelerating pace. More than 200 games and applications now supports NVIDIA RTX, including 125 with NVIDIA DLSS. This quarter alone, 45 new games shipped with DLSS. And NVIDIA Reflex Latency Reducing Technology is in top esports titles, including Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Overwatch. In addition, the Reflex ecosystem continues to grow with Reflex technology now integrated in almost 50 gaming peripherals. NVIDIA studio for creators keeps expanding. Last month at the Adobe MAX Creativity Conference, Adobe announced two powerful AI features for Adobe Lightroom and the Lightroom Classic, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. In addition, several of our partners launched new studio systems, including Microsoft, HP and ASUS. We estimate that a quarter of our installed base has adopted RTX GPUs. Looking ahead, we expect continued upgrades as well as growth from NVIDIA GeForce users, given rapidly expanding RTX support and the growing popularity of gaming, esports, content creation and streaming. Our GPUs are capable of crypto mining, but we don't have visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. In Q3, nearly all of our Ampere architecture gaming desktop GPU shipments were lite hash rate to help steer GeForce supply to gamers. Crypto mining processor revenue was $105 million, which is included in our OEM and other. Our cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, has two major achievements this quarter. First, Electronic Arts brought more of its hit games to the server. And second, we announced the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier, priced at less than $100 for six months. GeForce Now membership has more than doubled in this last year to over 14 million gamers for streaming content from 30 data centers in more than 80 countries. Moving to Pro Visualization. Q3 revenue of $577 million was up 11% sequentially and up 144% from the year ago quarter. The sequential rise was led by mobile workstations with desktop workstations also growing, as enterprises deployed systems to support hybrid work environment. Building on the strong initial ramp in Q2, Ampere architecture sales continue to grow, leading verticals, including media and entertainment, healthcare, public sector and automotive. Last week, we announced general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for simulating physically accurate 3D world and digital twins. Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible. Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin and Sony Pictures. More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December. There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in the global market. Moving to Automotive. Q3 revenue of $135 million declined 11% sequentially and increased 8% from the year ago quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by AI cockpit revenue, which has negatively been impacted by automotive manufacturers supply constraints. We announced that self-driving truck start-up, Kodiak Robotics; auto maker, Lotus; autonomous bus manufacturers, QCraft; and EV start-up, WM Motor, have adopted NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for their next-generation vehicles. They join a large and rapidly growing list of companies adopting and developing on NVIDIA DRIVE, including auto OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, NAVs, trucking companies, mobile taxis and software start-ups. Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $2.9 billion grew 24% sequentially and 55% from the year ago quarter with record revenue across both hyperscale and vertical industries. Strong growth was led by hyperscale customers, fueled by continued rapid adoption of Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs for both internal and external workloads. Hyperscale compute revenue doubled year-on-year, driven by the scale out of natural language processing and recommendator models and cloud computing. Vertical industry growth was also strong, led by consumer Internet and broader cloud providers. For example, Barco Cloud deployed NVIDIA GPUs for its launch of AI services, such as tech analysis, speech recognition, computer vision and anomaly detection. We continue to achieve exceptional growth and influence, which again outpaced our overall Data Center growth. We have transitioned our lineup of infant-focused processes to the Ampere architecture, such as the A30 GPU. We also released the latest version of our Triton Inference Server software, enabling compute-intensive inference workloads such as large language models to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance. Over 25,000 companies worldwide use NVIDIA AI inference. A great new example is Microsoft Teams, which has nearly 250 million monthly active users. It uses NVIDIA AI to convert speech to text real time during video calls in 28 languages in a cost-effective way. We reached three milestones to help drive more mainstream enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI. First, we announced the general availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite with AI tools and frameworks that enables the hundreds of thousands of companies running NVIDIA, running vSphere to virtualize AI workloads on NVIDIA-certified systems. Second, VMware announced a future update to vSphere with Tanzu that is fully optimized for NVIDIA AI. When it's combined with NVIDIA AI enterprise, enterprises can efficiently manage cloud-native AI development and deployment on main stream data center servers and clouds with existing IT tools. And third, we expanded our launch cloud program globally with ethernet as our first digital infrastructure partner. NVIDIA LaunchPad is now available in nine locations worldwide, providing enterprises with immediate access to NVIDIA software and infrastructure to help them prototype and test data science and AI workloads. LaunchPad features NVIDIA-certified systems and NVIDIA DGX systems running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack. In networking, revenue was impacted as demand outstripped supply. We saw momentum toward higher speed and new generation products, including ConnectX-5 and 6. We announced the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second end-to-end networking platform, consisting of the Quantum-2 switch the ConnectX-7 network adapter and the BlueField-3 DPU. The NVIDIA Quantum-two, which is available from a wide range of building infrastructure and system vendors around the world. Earlier this week, the latest top 500 list of supercomputers showed continued momentum for our full stack computing approach. NVIDIA's technologies accelerate over 70% of the systems Muslims on the including over 90% of all new systems and 23 of the top 25 most energy-efficient systems. Turning to GTC. Last week we hosted our GPU Technology Conference, which had over 270,000 registered attendees. Jensen's keynote has been viewed 25 million times over the past eight days. While our Spring GTC is focused on new chips and systems, this edition focused on software, demonstrating our full computing stack. Let me cover some of the highlights. Our vision for Omniverse came to life at GTC. We significantly expanded this ecosystem and announced new capabilities. Omniverse replication is an engine for producing data to train robots, replicating augment real-world data with massive, diverse and physically accurate synthetic data sets to both accelerate development of high-quality, high-performance AI across computing demand. NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar is our platform for generating interactive AI avatars. It connects several core NVIDIA SDKs including switch AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines and simulation. Applications including automated customer service, virtual collaboration and content solution. Replicator ad avatar joined several other announced features and capabilities for Omniverse, including AI, AR, VR and simulation-based technologies. We introduced 65 new and updated software development page, bringing our total to more than 150 serving industries from gaming and design to AI, cybersecurity, 5G and robotics. One of the STKs is our first four licensed AI model, NVIDIA Riva, for building conversational AI applications. Companies using Riva during the open beta include RingCentral for video conference live captioning and Pig An for customer service chatbots. NVIDIA Riva Enterprise will be commercially available early next year, for launch. We introduced the NVIDIA's NeMo Megatron optimized for training large language models on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure. This combination brings together production-ready, enterprise-grade hardware and software in both vertical industries, develop language and industry-specific dropbox, personal systems, content generation and summarization. Early adopters include SiDi, JD.com and VinBrain. We unveiled BlueField DOCA 1.2, the latest version of our GPU programming lender with new cybersecurity capabilities. DOCA is to our GPUs as CUDA is to our GPUs. It enables developers to build applications and services on top of our BlueFiled DOCAs. Our new capabilities make BlueField the ideal platform for the industry to build their own zero trust security platforms. The leading cybersecurity companies are working with us to provision their next-generation firewall service on BlueField, including Checkpoint, Juniper, Borgne, F5, Palo Alto Networks and VMware. And we released Clara Holoscan, a edge AI computing platform for medical instruments to improve decision-making tools in areas such as robo-assisted surgery, interventional radiology and radiation therapy planning. Other new or expanded SDKs or libraries unveiled at GTC include ReOpt for AI optimized logistics Quantum for quantum computing, Morpheus for cybersecurity, Modulus for physical-based machine learning and Crunet Numeric, a data center scale mass library to bring accelerated computing to the large and growing Python ecosystem. All in, NVIDIA's computing platform continues to expand as a broadening set of SDK enable more and more GPU-accelerated applications and industry use cases. CUDA has been downloaded 30 million times, and our developer ecosystem is now nearing 3 million strong. The applications they develop on top of our SDK and the cloud to edge computing platform are helping to transform multitrillion dollar industries from healthcare to transportation to mental services, manufacturing, logistics and virtual. In Automotive, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur, AI software platforms that enhance a vehicle's performance, features and safety. Live Concierge build on Omniverse Avatar functioned as an AI-based in-vehicle person-assistance, but enables automatic parking, summoning capabilities. It also enhanced safety by monitoring the driver throughout the duration of the drive. DRIVE Chauffeur offers autonomous capabilities, relieving the driver of constantly having to control the car. It will also perform address to address driving when combined with DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform. For robotics, we announced Jetson AGX Orin, the world's smallest, most powerful and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous mission and embedded computing at the Edge. Built on our Ampere architecture, Jetson AGX Orin provides 6 times the processing power of its predecessor and delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to a GPU-enabled server that fits into the palm of your hand. Jetson AGX Orin will be available in the first quarter of calendar 2022. Finally, we revealed plans to build Earth-2, the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to confronting climate change. The system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the U.K.'s most powerful AI supercomputer that we built for corporate research. Earth-2 furnishes all the technologies we've invented up to this moment. Let me discuss Arm. I'll provide you a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. Arm with NVIDIA is a great opportunity for the industry and customers with NVIDIA's scale, capabilities and robust understanding of data center computing, acceleration and AI. We assessed Arm in expanding their reach into data center, IOT and PCs and advanced Arm's IP for decades to come. The combination of our companies can enhance competition in the industry as we work together on further building the world of AI. Regulators at the U.S. FTC have expressed concerns regarding the transaction and we are engaged in discussions with them regarding remedies to address those concerns. The transactions has been under review by China Antitrust Authority, pending the formal case initiation. Regulators in the U.K. and the EU have declined to approve the transaction in Phase 1 of their reviews on competition concerns. In the U.K., they have also voiced national security concerns. We have begun the Phase 2 process in the EU and U.K. jurisdictions. Despite these concerns and those raised by some Arm licensees, we continue to believe in the merits and the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, to its licensees and to the industry. We believe these concerns and those raised by some Arm licensees -- we continue to believe in the merits and benefits of the ongoing acquisition. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was up 260 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to higher end mix within desktop, notebook, GeForce GPUs. The year-on-year increase also benefited from a reduced impact of acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by growth in our Data Center Ampere architecture products, which is particularly offset by mix in gaming. Non-gaming gross margin was up 150 basis points from a year earlier and up 30 basis points sequentially. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.97, 83% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.17, up 60% from a year ago, adjusting for our stock split. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier and down from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayment for long-term supply agreement. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect sequential growth to be driven by Data Center and Gaming, more than offsetting a decline in CMP. Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.3% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.02 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $275 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary. Other information is also available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Credit Suisse 25th Annual Technology Conference in person on November 30th. We will also be at the Wells Fargo Fifth Annual TMT Summit virtually on December 1st, the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6th, and the Deutsche Bank Virtual Auto Tech Conference on December 9th. Our earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 16. With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we have Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Aaron, your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the results. I guess, I wanted to ask about Omniverse. Obviously, a lot of excitement around that. I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it, 12 months and how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse. I know you've talked about $40 million total 3D designers, I think that actually doubled what you talked about back in August. So I'm just curious of how we at finance line should probably think about that opportunity materializing?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks. Omniverse success will be defined by, number one, developer engagement, connecting with developers around the world; two, applications being developed by enterprises; three, the connection -- designers and creators among themselves. Those are the nearest term -- and I would say that in my type of definition, etc. Near term also, it should be revenues and Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote and I'll highlight a few of them right now. One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect 3D and digital design world. Think of Adobe as a world, think of the Autodesk as a world, think of Revit as a world. These are design world in the sense that people are doing things in it, they are creating things in it and they have to run database. We made it possible for these worlds to be connected for the very first time and for it to be shared like in cloud documents. That's not been possible ever before and we can now share work with each other, you can see each other's work, you can collaborate. And so in the world of remote working, Ominverse's collaboration capability is going to be really appreciated and that should happen right away. We would like to see that happen in very near term. And that drives of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales. The second use case is digital twins. And we show in these following examples of how several companies using Omniverse to create a digital twin of a city so that they could optimize radio placements and radio energy used for beamforming. You saw BMW using it for their factories. You're going to see people using it for warehouse, logistics warehouse to plan and to optimize their warehouses and deploying the robots. And so digital twin applications are absolutely immediate. And then remember, robots has several clients. There is the physical robot that you saw and a physical robot would be a self-driving car and physical robots would be the car itself, turning it into a robot, so that it could be an intelligent assistant. But I demonstrated probably the -- in my explanation, the largest application of robots in the future and its avatars. We built Omniverse Avatars to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology for computer vision, for speech recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation and speech synthesis, recommender systems, all of that integrated into one system and running in real time. That Avatar system is essentially a robotic system and the way that you use that is, for example, with $25 million or so retail stores, restaurant, places like airports and train stations, office buildings and such, where you're going to have intelligent Avatars doing a lot of assistance. They might be doing check out, they might be doing check in, they might be doing customer support and all of that can be done with Avatars, as I've demonstrated. So the virtual robotics application, digital buys of Avatars, it is going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity. So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse is one of the main users and the main users could be one of the 20 million creators or 20 million designers and the 40 million creators and designers around the world and they share Omniverse, each one of the main users would be a $1,000 per user per year. But don't forget that intelligent use or intelligent users that have been connected through Omniverse will likely be much larger as digital buyers than humans. So I mentioned 40 million, but there are 100 million cars. And these 100 million cars will have the capability to have something like in Omniverse Avatar and so those 100 million cars could be $1,000 per car per year. And in the case of the 25 million or so places where you would have a digital avatar as customer support or check out smart retail or smart warehouses or smart whatever it is, those avatars also would each individually be a new account and so they would be $1,000 per Avatar per year. And so those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us and I demonstrate the applications in related keynotes. And then of course behind all of that, call it a couple of hundred million digital agents, intelligent agents, some of them humans, some of them robots, some of them Avatars adds $1,000 per agent per year. Behind it are, NVIDIA GPUs in PC, NVIDIA GPU in cloud, and NVIDIA GPUs in Omniverse servers. And my guess would be that the hardware part of it is probably going to be about half and then the licensing part of it is probably about half of the time. So this is really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we've ever seen. And the reason why it's taken so long for us to manifest is because it requires three fundamental technologies to come together, I guess four fundamentals technologies to come together. First of all, it's video graphic; second is physics simulation, because we're talking about things in world that has to be believable, so it has to obey the laws of physics; and then third is artificial intelligence, as I demonstrated and illustrated just now. And all of it runs on top of an Omniverse computer that has to do not just AI, not just physics, not just computer graphics, but all of it. And so long term why people are so excited about it is, at the highest level what it basically means is that that long-term when we engage in that, which is largely 2D today, long-term every query would be 3D and instead of just querying information, we would query and interact with people and Avatars and things and places and all of these things are in 3D. So hopefully one of these days that we will probably realize it as fast as we can every transaction that goes on to internet touches a GPU and today that's a very small percentage, but hopefully one of these days it will be a bit of a high percentage. So I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Mark, your line is open.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, it seems like every year there seems to be a new set of demand drivers for your accelerated platform, accelerated processing ecosystem, there's gaming, then neural network and AI and then blockchain and then ray tracing. And five or six years ago, you guys showed a bunch of virtual reality demos, which were really exciting at your Analyst Day, excitement died down, now it seems to be resurfacing particularly with Omniverse Avatar capability and Facebook shedding light on the opportunities. So the two questions from that are, how close is your Omniverse Avatar to morphing into like a mass market technology that everybody uses daily? You talk about like -- you said that everybody is going to be a gamer, everybody is going to be a Omniverse Avatar user. And maybe the bigger picture is, is it reasonable to think about new killer app coming out every year? Is there a parallel that we should think about with previous computing markets that we could think about for the computing area that we're entering right now? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I really appreciate that. Chips are enablers, but chips don't create markets, software creates market. At this point, I explain over the years that accelerated computing is very different than general purpose computing and the reason for that is because you can't just write into compiler and compile quantum physics into a chip. I mean, it doesn't. You can't just compile Schrodinger's equation and have it distributed across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and have a new SaaS. You just -- you can't do that for computer graphics, you can't do that for artificial intelligence, you can't do that for robotics, you can't do that for the most of the interesting applications in the world and because we really run out of steam with GPUs and that people are saying that not because it's not true, it is abundantly clear that the amount of instruction in parallel that you can squeeze out of a system is although not zero is incredibly hard, it's just incredibly hard. And there is another approach and we have been advocating accelerated computing for some time and now people really see the benefit of it, but it does requires a lot of work and yet the work basically says for every domain, for every application we have -- for every application in large domain that you'll use, you have to have a whole stack. And so whenever you want to open a new market by accelerating those applications or that domain of applications, you have to come up with a new stack and the new stack is hard, because you have to understand the application, you have to understand the algorithms, the mathematics, you have to understand computer science to distribute it across, to take something that was single threaded and make it multi-threaded and make something that we've done sequentially and make it process in parallel. You break everything, you break storage, you break networking, you break everything. And so it takes a fair amount of expertise and that's why we're saying that over the years, over the course of 30 years we have become a full-stack company, because we've been trying to solve this problem practically through decades. And so that's one. But the benefit, once you have the ability, then you can open new markets and we played a really large role in democratizing artificial intelligence and making it possible for anybody to be able to do it. Our greatest contribution is I hope when it's all said and done that we democratized scientific computing, so that researchers and scientists, computer scientists, data scientists, scientists of all kinds were able to get access to this incredibly powerful tool that we call computers to do advance research. And so every single year we're coming up with new stacks and we got a whole bunch of stacks we are working on and many of them are working on in plain sight, so that you see it coming, you just have to connect it together. One of the areas that we spoke about this time, of course, was Omniverse and you saw the pieces of it being built over time, and it took half a decade to start building Omniverse, but it built on a quarter century of work. In the case of the Omniverse Avatar, you could literally point to MERLIN, the recommender; Megatron, the language -- large language model; Riva, the speech AI, all of our computer vision AIs that have been demonstrating over the years, natural speech synthesis that we see every single year with I AM AI the opening credits, how we're using, developing an AI to be able to speak in a human way so that people feel more comfortable and more engaged with the AI. Face, eye tracking, Maxine and all of these technologies are connected together. They were all built in pieces, but we integrated it, we have the intentions of integrating it and to create what it's called Omniverse Avatar. And now you asked the question, how quickly will we deploy this? I believe Omniverse Avatar will be in drive-thrus and restaurants, fast food restaurants, check out with restaurants, in retail stores, all over the world within less than five years. And we're going to need it in all kinds of different applications, because there is such a great shortage of labor and there is such a wonderful way that you can now engage in Avatar and it could -- it doesn't make mistakes, it doesn't get tired and it's always on and we made so that it's cloud native and so when you saw the keynote, I hope you'd agree that the interaction is instantaneous and the conversational forum is so enjoyable. And so anyway, I think what you highlight is, one, accelerated computing is a full-stack challenge. Two, it takes software to open new markets. Chips can't open new markets. If you build another chip, you can steal somebody's share, but you can't open new market and it takes software to open new market. NVIDIA switch with software, and that's one of the reasons why we could integrate such large market opportunities. And then last with respect to Omniverse, I believe it's a near-term opportunity that we've be working on for some three, four, five years.\nOperator: For our next question, we have C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And I guess not an Omniverse question, but I guess, Jensen, I'd like your commitment that you will not use Omniverse to target the sell-side research industry. As my real question, can you speak to your Data Center visibility into 2022 and beyond? And within this outlook, can you talk to traditional cloud versus industry verticals and then perhaps emerging opportunities like Omniverse and others? Would love to get a sense of kind of what you're seeing today. And then as part of that, how you're planning to secure foundry and other supply to support that growth? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thank you, C.J. First of all, we have secured guaranteed supply, very large amounts of it, quite a spectacular amount of it from the world's leading foundry in substrate and packaging and testing certain companies, the integral part of our supply chain. And so we have done that and feel very good about our supply situation, particularly starting in the second half of this year and going forward. I think this whole last year was a wakeup call for everybody to be much more mindful about not taking the supply chain for granted and we were fortunate to have such good partners, but nonetheless we've secured our future. With respect to Data Center, about half of our Data Center business comes from the cloud and cloud service providers and the other half comes from enterprise, what we call enterprise companies and they're in all kinds of industries. And about 1% of it comes from supercomputing centers, because so 50% or so cloud, 50% or so enterprise and 1% supercomputing centers. And we expect next year, the cloud, the cloud service providers to scale out their deep learning and their AI workloads really aggressively and we're seeing that right now. We built a really fantastic platform and -- number one. Number two, the work we've been doing with TensorRT, which has the run time that goes into the server that's called Triton is one of our best pieces of work. We're just so proud of it. And we said nearly four years ago, three-and-half years ago that Inference is going to be one of the great computer science challenges, and it's really proving to be so. And the reason for that is, because sometimes it's throughput, sometimes it's latency, sometimes interactivity on the type of models we have with Inference. It's just all over the map, it's not just computer vision or image recognition, it's all over the map. And the reason for that is there's many different types of architectures, there's so many different ways to build different applications and so the application is complicated. And finally there is just a wonderful people working. We're now on our 8th generation on that. It's adopted all over the world. Some 25,000 companies are now using NVIDIA AI and recently at GTC we announced two very, very big things. One, we remind everybody that we -- just this month before we have tried to support now just in every generation of NVIDIA GPUs, of which there are so many versions to be managing without trying how would you possibly deploy AI across the entire fleet of NVIDIA servers, NVIDIA GPU servers that are all over world and so it's almost an essential tool just to operate and take advantage of all of NVIDIA's GPU that are in datacenter. Two, we support CPUs. And so it's no longer necessary for someone to have two Inference servers. You can just have one Inference servers, because the NVIDIA version is already essential. Now everybody could just use Triton and every single server in the Data Center could be part of the Inference capacity and then we did something else that was really big deal at GTC, which is the so-called Forced Inference Library, called FIL, that basically the most popular machine learning systems in Inference models are based on trees and decision trees and boosted gradient trees and people might know it as XGBoost. And trees all over the place, in fraud detection, in recommender systems and utilized in companies all over the world, because it's just self-explanatory. You can build upon it, you don't worry about regressions. It could build bigger and bigger trees. And we -- this GTC we announced that we support that as well. And so all of the sudden, all of that workflow that runs on CPU is not only do they run on Triton, it becomes accelerated. And the last -- the next thing that NVIDIA will announce, with the tremendous interest in large language models, Triton now also supports multi-GPU and multi-node Inference, so that we could take something like an OpenAI GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron 530B or anybody's giant model that's been developed all over the world in all these different languages, in all these different domains, in all these different fields of science and what -- in industry where we can now influence it in real time. And I demonstrated it in one of the demos, there was a question answering model that the team built and it was able to basically answer questions in real-time. And so that is just a giant venture and these are the type of workloads that's going to make it possible for us to continue to scale out and build on these, so. So back to your original question, I think next year is going to be quite a good year for Data Center. Customers are very mindful of securing their supply for their scale out and so we have a fair amount of visibility and more visibility commonly than ever at Data Center, but in addition to that, Triton is just in adoption everywhere. And then, finally, our brand-new workloads, which is built on top of AI and graphics and simulation, which is Omniverse, and we saw the examples that I gave, these are real companies doing real work and one of the areas that has severe shortages around the world is customer support, just genuine severe shortages all over the world, and we think the answer is Omniverse Avatar. And it runs in Data Center, you could easily adapt Omniverse Avatar to do drive-thrus or retail check out or customer service, and I demonstrated that with Tokyo, a parking kiosk. You can use it for a tele-operated customer service and we've demonstrated that with Maxine and we demonstrated how you could use it even for video conferencing. And then lastly, we demonstrated how we could use Omniverse Avatar for robotics, for example, to create a continues work what we call DRIVE Concierge where the car is turned into intelligent customer support, intelligent agent. I think Omniverse Avatar is going to be a really exciting driver for enterprise this next year. And so next year is going to be a pretty terrific year for Data Center.\nOperator: For our next question, we have Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Stacy, your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask two of them on Data Center, both near term and then maybe a little longer term. On the near-term, Colette, you suggested guidance in the Q4 be driven by Data Center and gaming and you mentioned data center first. Does that mean that it's bigger? If you could just help us like parse the contribution of each into Q4? And then in the next year, given the commentary for the last question, again it sounds like you've got like a very strong outlook for Data Center both from hyperscale and enterprise. If I look at sort of the implied guidance you gave, Data Center for you is probably likely to grow 50% year-over-year in this fiscal year. Would it be crazy to think given all the drivers that it could grow by a similar amount next year as well? Like, how should we be thinking about that given all of the drivers that you've been laying out?\nColette Kress: Okay. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let's first focus in terms of our guidance for Q4. Our statements that we made were, yes, about driven by revenue growth from Data Center and Gaming sequentially. We can probably expect our Data Center to grow faster than our Gaming, probably both in terms of percentage wise and in absolute dollars. We also expect our CMP product to decline quarter-on-quarter to very negligible levels in Q4. So I hope that gives you a color on Q4. Now in terms of next year, we'll certainly turn the corner into the new fiscal year. We certainly provide guidance one quarter out. We've given you some great discussions here about the opportunities in front of us, opportunities with the hyperscales, the opportunities with the verticals. Omniverse is a full stack opportunity in front of us. We are securing supply for next year, not just for the current year and Q4, to allow us to really grow into so much of this opportunity going forward. But at this time, we're going to wait until next year to provide guidance.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you\nOperator: For the next question we have Vivek Arya from BofA Securities. Vivek, your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Actually I had two quick ones. And so, Colette, you suggested the inventory purchase and supply agreements are up, I think, almost 68% year-on-year. Does that provide some directional correlation with how you are preparing for growth over the next 12 to 24 months? So that's one question. And then the bigger question, Jensen, that I have for you is, where are we in the AI adoption cycle? What percentage of servers are accelerated in hyperscale and vertical industry today and where can those ratios get to?\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question. So let's first start in terms of supply or supply purchase agreement. You have noted that we are discussing that we have made payments toward some of those commitments. Not only are we procuring for what we need in the quarter, what we need next year and again we are planning for growth next year, so we have been planning that supply purchases, we are also doing long-term supply purchases. These are areas of capacity agreements and/or many of our different suppliers. We made a payment within this quarter of approximately $1.6 billion out of total long-term capacity agreement of about $3.4 billion. So we still have more payments to make and we were likely continue to be purchasing longer term to support our growth that we are planning for many years to come.\nJensen Huang: Every single server will be GPU accelerated some day. Today of all the clouds and all the enterprise, less than 10%. That kind of give you a sense of where you are. In terms of the workloads, it is also consistent with that in the sense that that a lot of the workloads still only run on CPUs, which is the reason why in order for us to grow, we have to be a full stack company and we have to go find applications, we now have to find plenty of it, focus on the application that require acceleration or benefits tremendously from acceleration that if they were to get a million X speed up, which sounds insane but it's not. Mathematically I can prove it to you and historically I can even demonstrate it to you that in many areas we have seen million X speed up and has completely revolutionized those industries, computer graphics is of course one of them. Omniverse would not be possible without it. And so the work that we're doing with digital biology, protein synthesis, which is likely going to be one of the large industries of the world that doesn't exist today at all. Protein engineering and the protein economy is likely going to be very, very large. You can't do that unless you are able to get million X speed up in the simulation of protein biology. And so those are -- and not to mention some of the most imperative comps that we have to build and engage. Climate science needs million X, billion X speed up and we are at a point where we can actually tackle that. And so in each one of these cases we have performed, we have to focus our resources to go and accelerate those applications and that translates to growth. Until then, they run on GPUs. And we look at a lot of today speech synthesis and speech recognition system, it still uses fairly traditional or mixture of traditional and deep learning approaches for speech AI. NVIDIA Riva is the world's first, I believe, that is end to end deep neural network. And we've worked with many companies in helping them advance there, so that they could move their clouds to our neural-based approaches. But that's one of the reasons why we do it, so that we could provide the reference, but we can also license it to enterprises around the world, so that they could advance it for their own use cases. And so one application after another we have to get it accelerated, one domain after another we have to get it accelerated. One of the ones that we're excited about and something that we've been working on for so long is EDA, even our own industry, Electronic Design Automation, for the very first time we announced the EDA using GPU accelerated computing, whether it's because of the artificial intelligence capability, because EDA is very large combinatorial optimization program and using artificial intelligence you could really improve the design quality and design time. So we're seeing from all the major game vendors, from chip design to simulation to PCB design and optimization, design synthesis, moving toward artificial intelligence and GPU acceleration in a very significant. And then we see that with a mechanical CAD and traditional CAD application now also jumping on to GPU acceleration is getting very significant speed ups. And so I'm super excited about the work that we're doing in each one of these domains. Because every time you do it, you open up brand new market and customers that never used NVIDIA GPUs now can, because ultimately people don't buy chips, it cannot solve problems. Without a full stack, without software expertise, you can't really commence the enabling technology, what the chip provide and ultimately solve the customers' problems.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy, your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Colette, I had a question about gross margin. Are there any margin headwinds maybe on the wafer pricing side that we should sort of think about normalizing out, because gross margin is pretty flat between fiscal Q2 and fiscal Q4. But I imagine that's kind of masking a strong underlying margin growth, especially as Data Center has been actually driving that growth. So I'm wondering if maybe there are some underlying factors that are sort of gating gross margin? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yes. So we have always been working on our gross margin and being able to absorb a lot of the cost changes along the way, architecture-to-architecture really. So that's always based into our gross margin. Our gross margins right now are largely stable. Our incremental revenue, for example, what we're expecting next quarter will likely align to our current gross margin levels that we finished in terms of Q3. Our largest driver always continues to be mix. We have a lot of different mix that has driven related to the high-end AI and RTX solutions, for example, and the software that is embedded in solutions have allowed us to increase our gross margin. As we look forward long-term, software if sold separately can be another driver of gross margin increases in the future. But cost changes, cost increases are -- generally been a part of our gross margin figures.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. We had an outstanding quarter. Demand for NVIDIA AI is strong with hyperscalers and cloud services deploying at scale and enterprises broadening adoption. We now help more than 25,000 companies that are using NVIDIA AI. And with NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite, our collaboration with VMware and our collaboration with Equinix to place NVIDIA LaunchPad across the world, every enterprise has an easy arm length to NVIDIA AI. Gaming and Pro Vis are surging. RTX opportunity continues to expand with the growing market of gamers, creators, designers and now professionals building home workstations. We are working hard to increase supply for the overwhelming demand this holiday season. Last week, GTC showcased the expanding universe of NVIDIA accelerated computing. In combination with AI and Data Center scale computing, the model we pioneered is on the cusp of producing million X speed ups that will revolutionize many important fields; already AI and upcoming robotics, digital biology and what I hope climate science. GTC highlighted our full stack expertise in action, built on CUDA and our acceleration libraries in data processing, in simulation, graphics, artificial intelligence, market and domain specific software is needed to solve customer problems. We also showed how software opens new growth opportunities for us. But the chips are the enablers, but it's the software that opens new growth opportunities. NVIDIA has 150 SDKs now addressed in many of the world's largest end markets. One of the major themes of this GTC was Omniverse, our simulation platform for virtual worlds and digital twin. Our body of work and expertise in graphics, physics simulation, AI, robotics and full stack computing made Omniverse possible. At GTC, we showed how Omniverse is used to reinvent collaborative design, customer service avatars and video conferencing and digital twin to factories, processing plants and even entire cities. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what's to come. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn over to Jensen for closing remarks.\nSimona Jankowski: Well, I think we just heard the closing remarks. Thank you so much for joining us. We look forward to seeing everybody at the conferences that we have planned over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk before the end of next earnings. Thanks again, everybody.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]"}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2021-08-18 22:58:08", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another strong quarter with revenue of $6.5 billion and year-on-year growth of 68%. We set records for total revenue, as well as for gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Starting with gaming, revenue was 3.1 billion, was up 11% sequentially, and up 85% from a year earlier.  Demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply. We are now four quarters into the Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming, and it continues to be our best effort.  At COMPUTEX in June, we announced two powerful new GPUs for gamers and creators, the GeForce, RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 3070 Ti, delivering 50% faster performance than their prior-generation with acclaimed features, such as real-time retracing, NVIDIA DLSS, AI, rendering, Reflex, and broadcast.  Laptop demand was also very strong. OEMs adopted Ampere architecture GPU s in a record number of designs. From the top of the line gaming laptops to those -- to mainstream price points as low as $799 that brings the power of GeForce GPUs to gamers, students, and creators on the go.  Ampere architecture-powered laptops feature our third generation Max-Q power optimization technology that enables ultrathin designs, such as the new Alienware X15, the world's most powerful sub-16-millimeter gaming laptop.  NVIDIA RTX technology has reset computer graphics and spurred our biggest ever refresh cycle. Ampere's been our fastest ramping gaming GPU architecture on Steam. And the combination of Turing and Ampere RTX GPUs has only upgraded about 20% of our installed base. 80% have yet to upgrade to RTX.  And the audience for global eSports will soon approach 0.5 billion people, while the number of those who live stream games is expected to reach over 700 million. The number of PC gamers on Steam is up almost 20% over the past year.  More than 60 RTX games now support NVIDIA's RTX ray tracing or DLSS, including today's biggest game franchises, such as Minecraft, Fortnite, and Cyberpunk. New RTX games this quarter includes Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the top-rated games of all time, popular titles like Rainbow Six Siege and rushed, and Minecraft RTX in China with over 400 million players. To competitive gamers, NVIDIA Reflex, which includes latency, is now supported by 20 games. Let me say a few words on crypto currency mining.  In an effort to address the needs of miners and direct GeForce to gamers, we increased the supply of Crypto currency Mining Processors, or CMP, and introduced low hash rate GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability. Over 80% of our Ampere architecture base GeForce shipments in the quarter were low hash rate GPUs.  The combination of crypto to gaming revenue is difficult to quantify. CMP revenue, which is recognized in OEM, was 266 million, lower than our original 400 million estimates on reduced mining profitability and we expect a minimal contribution from CMP going forward.  GeForce NOW reached a new milestone this quarter, surpassing 1,000 PC games, more than any other cloud gaming service. The premium tier is available for a subscription of $10 per month, giving gamers access to RTX class performance, even on an underpowered PC, Mac, Chromebook, iOS, or Android device.  Moving to pro visualization. Q2 revenue was a record 519 million, up 40% sequentially, and up 156% year-on-year. Strong sequential revenue growth was led by desktop workstations, driven by demand to outfit, design offices at home as remote work becomes the norm across industries.  This is also the first big quarter of the Ampere architecture ramp for pro visualization. King verticals driving Q2 demand include automotive, public sector, and healthcare. At SIGGRAPH last week, we announced an expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse, our simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the Metaverse.  Through new integrations with Blender, the world's leading open-source 3D animation tool, and Adobe, we're opening the Omniverse platform to millions of additional users. We are also collaborating with Apple and Pixar to bring advanced physics capabilities to Pixar's Universal Scene Description framework, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices.  Omniverse enterprise software is in the early access stage and will be generally available later this year on a subscription basis from NVIDIA's partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many others. Over 500 Companies are evaluating Omniverse Enterprise, including BMW, Volvo, and Lockheed Martin.  And more than 50,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since it entered open beta in December. Moving to automotive. Our Q2 revenue was 152 million, down 1% sequentially, and up 3% year-on-year Sequential revenue declines in infotainment were largely offset by growth in self-driving.  Looking further out, we have substantial design winds set to ramp that we expect will drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years. This quarter, we announced several additional wins.  Self-driving startup AutoX unveiled its latest autonomous driving platform for RoboTaxis powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. The performance and safety capabilities of the software-defined NVIDIA DRIVE platform have enabled AutoX to become one of the first companies in the world to provide full self-driving mobility services without the need for a safety driver.  In autonomous trucking, DRIVE's ecosystem partner, plus, signed a deal with Amazon to provide at least 1,000 self-driving systems to Amazon's fleet of delivery vehicles. These systems are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE for high-performance, energy-efficient, and centralized AI compute.  An autonomous trucking startup embarked is building on NVIDIA DRIVE. The system is being developed for trucks for four major OEMs, Freightliner, Navistar International, PACCAR, and Volvo, representing the vast majority of class 8 or largest size trucks in the U.S.  The NVIDIA DRIVE platform is being rapidly adopted across the transportation industry from passenger-owned vehicles to robotaxi to trucking and delivery vehicles. We believe everything that moves will be autonomous someday.  Moving to Data Center. Revenue of 2.4 billion grew 16% sequentially, and 35% from the year-ago quarter. The year-ago quarter, which was our first quarter to include Mellanox. Growth was driven by both hyperscale customers and vertical industries, each of which has record revenues.  Our flagship A100 continuing to ramp across hyper-scale and cloud computing customers, with Microsoft Azure announcing general availability in June, following AWS and Google Cloud Platforms' general availability in prior quarters.  Vertical industry demand was strong, with sequential growth led by financial services, supercomputing, and telecom customers. We also had exceptional growth in Inference, which reached a record more than doubling year-on-year.  Revenue from Inference focussed processors includes the new A30 GPU, which provides four times the Inference performance of the T4. Customers are also turning to NVIDIA GPUs to take AI to production and shifting from CPUs to GPUs, driven by the stringent performance, latency, and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workloads, and NVIDIA Networking products posted solid results.  We see momentum across regions driven by our technology of leadership with upgrades to high-speed products, such as ConnectX-6, as well as new customer wins across cloud service providers, enterprise, and high-performance computing. We extended our leadership in supercomputing.  The latest top 500 niche shows that NVIDIA technologies power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers, including 70% of all new systems and eight of the top 10, to help companies harness the new industrial high-performance computing revolution.  We deliver a turnkey AI Data Center solution with the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the same technology that powers our new Cambridge-1 supercomputer in the UK and a number of others in the top 500. We expanded our AI software and subscription offerings, making it easier for enterprises to adopt AIs from the initial development stage through to deployment and operations.  We announced NVIDIA Base Command, our software-as-a-service offering for operating and managing large-scale, multi-user, and multi-team AI development workloads on DGX SuperPOD.  Base Command is the operating and management system software for distributed training customers. We also announced the general availability of NVIDIA Fleet Command, our managed edge AI software-as-a-service offering.  Fleet Command helps Companies solve the problem of securely deploying and managing AI applications across thousands of remote locations, combining the efficiency and simplicity of central management with the cost performance and data sovereignty benefits of real-time processing at the edge.  Early adopters of Fleet Command include some of the world's leading retail, manufacturing, and logistics companies and the specialty software Companies that work with them.  The new NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command software and subscription offerings followed last quarter's announcements of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is early access with general availability expected soon.  Our enterprise software strategy is supported by the NVIDIA certified system program with the server OEMs, which are bringing to market over 55 systems ready to run on NVIDIA's AI software out of the box to help enterprises simplify and accelerate their AI deployment.  The NVIDIA ecosystem keeps getting stronger. NVIDIA Inception, our acceleration platform for AI startups, just surpassed 8,500 members with cumulative funding of over 60 billion and numbers in 90 countries. Inception is one of the largest AI startup ecosystems in the world.  CUDA now has been downloaded 27 million times since it launched 15-years ago, with 7 million in the last year alone. TensorRT for inference has been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times across more than 27,000 Companies. And the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem now exceeds 2.6 million, up 4 times in the past 4 years.  Let me give you a quick update on Arm. In nearly one year since we initially agreed to combine with Arm, we have gotten to know the Company, its business, and its people much better.  We believe more than ever in the power of our combination, and the benefits it would deliver for Arm, for the UK, and its customers across the world in the era of AI. Arm has great potential. We love their business model and commit to keeping its open licensing approach.  And with NVIDIA's scale and capabilities, Arm will make more IP, and sooner, for their mobile and embedded customers while expanding into Data Center, IOT, and other new markets. NVIDIA accelerates computing, which starts with the CPU.  Whatever new markets are open with the CPU and our accelerated computing opportunities. We've announced accelerated platforms for Amazon Graviton, Ampere Computing, MediaTek, and more about expanding cloud computing, AI, cloud gaming, Supercomputing, Edge AI, to Chrome PCs.  We plan to invest in the U.K. and we have with the Cambridge-1 supercomputer. And through ARM making U.K. a global center in science, technology, and AI. We are working through the regulatory process, although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns and objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought. We are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry. Moving to the rest of the P&L, the GAAP gross margin of 64.8% for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from the year earlier, reflecting the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition-related costs.  GAAP gross margins were up 70 basis points sequentially, non-GAAP gross margins were 66.7% up 70 basis points from a year earlier and up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting higher ASPs within the desktop, G4s, GPUs, our continued growth in high end and pure architecture products, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center.  Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.94 up 276% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, up 89% from the year-earlier, adjusting for the 4 to 1 stock split effective this quarter. Q2 cash flow from operations was a record 2.7 billion. Let me turn to the outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2022.  We expect another strong quarter with sequential growth driven largely by accelerating demand in Data Center. In addition, we expect sequential growth in each of our three other market platforms. Gaming demand is continuing to exceed supply as we expect channel inventories to remain below target levels as we exit Q3.  The contribution of CMP to our revenue outlook is amongst. Revenue is expected to be 6.8 billion plus or minus 2%, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.  GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 1.96 billion and 1.37 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately 60 million, excluding gains and losses on equity securities.  GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are supposed to be expected 11%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 200 million to 225 million.  Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the following virtual events.  The BMO Technology Summit on August 24th, the New Street Big Ideas in Semiconductors Conference on September 9th, the Citi Global Tech Conference on September 13, the Piper Sandler Global Technology Conference on September 14th, and the Evercore ISI Auto Check and AI Forum on September 21st.  Our earnings call to discuss the third-quarter results are scheduled for Wednesday, November 17th. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please pull for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a near and longer-term question on the data center. I think near-term you mentioned the possibility of accelerating data center growth from the 35% rate.  I was hoping if you could give us some more color around that confidence and visibility. And then longer-term, Jensen, we've seen a lot of announcements from NVIDIA about your Enterprise software opportunity. I honestly don't know how to model that. It sounds very promising, but how should we model it? What problem are you trying to solve?  Is it cannibalizing demand you might have otherwise seen from your public Cloud customers, or is this incremental to growth? So just any guidance or any just insights into how to think about NVIDIA's Enterprise software opportunity longer-term? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks for the question. We are seeing accelerated -- as we've already reported that we have record revenues in both hyperscale cloud and industrial enterprise this last quarter. And we're seeing accelerated growth.  The exploration in hyperscale and cloud comes from the transitioning of the cloud services providers in taking their AI applications, which are now heavily deep learning-driven into production. There were some things that we've spoken about in the past that we'll make Vinny the ideal partner to scale up with.  And there are several elements of our platform. Number one, Ampere GPU, which is now a universal GPU for AI, for training, but incredibly good for [Indiscernible] it\u2019s terrific and its throughput, it's terrific, and it's a fast response client as well.  And therefore, the cost of deployment, the cost of operating the AI applications is the lowest. The second is the introduction of TensorRT, which is our optimizing compiler that makes it possible for us to compile and optimize any AI application to our GPUs.  And whether its computer vision or natural language understanding conversational AI, recommender systems, the type of applications that are deploying AIs is really quite vast.  And then lastly, this software Inference server that we offer is called Triton, which supports every one of our GPUs. It supports CPU s as well as GPUs still. So every internet service provider could operate their entire data center using Triton.  These several things are really accelerating our growth. So the first element is the deployment and transition of deep learning AI applications into large-scale deployment.  In the Enterprise, the application that is driving AI, as you know, every enterprise wants to get a race towards being a tech company and take advantage of connected clouds and connected devices and artificial intelligence to achieve it.  And they have an opportunity to deploy AI services out of the edge. And in order to do so, there are several things that have to happen. First, we have to create a computing platform that allows them to do training in the IT environment that they understand, which is virtualized, which is largely managed by VMware.  And our collaboration with VMware, creating a new type of system that could be integrated into Enterprise has been quite a significant effort, and it's in volume production today.  The second is a server that allows the enterprise customers to deploy their AI models out to the Edge. And the AI engine, the software suite that we've been developing over the last 10 years, now has been integrated into this environment and allows the enterprises to basically run AI out of the vast.  There are three elements of our stuff of product there. For instance, NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And that basically puts all of the state-of-the-art AI solvers and engines and libraries that we've industrialized and perfected over the years, have made available to Enterprise license.  The second is an operating system platform called Base Command that allows for distributed Gala software development for training and developing models, and then the third is Fleet Command, which is an operating system software product that lets you operate and deploy and manage the AI models out to the Edge.  These three software products, in combination with the server called NVIDIA Certified, taken out through our network of partners is our strategy to accelerate the adoption of AI by the Enterprise customers. So we're really enthusiastic about entering into the software business model.  This is an opportunity that could represent, of course, tens of millions of servers, we could link all of them with the GPU accelerated, and we believe that Enterprises will be deploying and taking advantage of AI to revolutionize the industry. And using a credit traditional enterprise software licensing business model. This could represent billions of dollars of profit inputs.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back, Colette, the sequential guidance, you gave a little bit of colour by segments. I've been looking at your gaming revenues. It's like three quarters in a row, you've been up, call it ballpark, 10% or 11%. And my understanding is that was a function of your ability to bring on supply.  So I guess what does the supply issue look like as you're going from Q2 into Q3? And do you think you can still maintain that kind of sequential growth or does it dial down because I also need to -- I also would play that against your other commentary suggesting that the sequential growth -- and I assume on a dollar basis would be driven primarily by Data Center.  So how do I think about the interplay within those comments of sequential growth of gaming, especially given the trajectories out of the last several quarters?\nColette Kress: Yeah. Let me start and I'll let Jensen add a bit, Stacy, to your question. I guess we're providing the guidance for Q3 of 6.8 billion in revenue. Now excluding CMP, we expect our revenue to grow over 500 million sequentially. A lion's share of that sequential revenue increase will be coming from Data Center.  We do expect gaming to be up slightly on a sequential basis but remember we are still supply constrained. Automotive and ProBiz are also expected to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. And from the CMP perspective, we'll probably just have minimal amounts in Q3.  So our Q3 results don't have seasonality with them for gaming and are really about the supply that we believe we can have for Q3. I'll see if Jensen wants to add any more colours.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks for your questions. As you know RTX is a fundamental recap of computer graphics. This is a technology called ray tracing that has been the holy grail of computer graphics for quite a long time for 35 years, and our NVIDIA research for 10 years, we finally made it possible to do real-time ray tracing with RTX.  RTX's demand is quite incredible, and as you know, we have a large [Indiscernible] that uses an architecture called GTX based on programmable shelters that we invented some 20 years ago. And now, we've reset the entire installed base, and Ampere is off to just the incredible starting the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our Company.  And yet, we've only upgraded some 20% -- less than 20% of our total installed base. There's another 80% of the world's PC gaming market that we have yet to upgrade to RTX. Meanwhile, the number of PC gamers in the world grew substantially. Steam grew 20% this last year. And so I think the -- we're right at the beginning of our RTX transition.  Meanwhile, computer graphics has expanded into so many different new markets. RTX, we've always believed would re-invent the way that people did design. And we're seeing that happening right now as we speak as Workstations is growing faster than ever and has achieved record revenues.  And at the same time, because of all of our work with cloud gaming, we now see public clouds putting in cloud graphics, whether its workstations or PC s or private gaming consoles up in the Cloud. So we're seeing strong demand in PCs, in laptops, in workstations, in mobile workstations, in the cloud. And so RTX is really doing great.  Our challenge there is that demand is so much greater than supply. And again, as Colette said, [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Before my questions, Jensen, I just wanted to say congrats on the Noyce Award, that's a big honor. For my question, I wanted to follow on Stacy's question about supply.  And Colette, maybe you could give us a little bit of commentary around supply constraints in gaming in the different tiers or price tiers of your gaming cards. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how you guys are managing supply across the different price tiers.  And I guess it translates into a question of, are the gaming ASPs that we're seeing in the October quarter guidance, are those what you would call sustainable going forward, or do you feel like that mix may change as supply comes online? Thank you.\nColette Kress: I'll start here. Thanks for the question on our overall mix as we go forward. First, our supply constraint in our gaming business is largely attributed to our desktop and notebook. That can mean a lot of different things from our components that are necessary to build so many of our products.  But our mix is really important. Our mix as we are also seeing many of our gamers very interested in our higher-end, higher performance products. We will continue to see that as a driver about overall lifts both our revenue and can lift our overall gross margins.  So there are quite a few different pieces into our supply that we have to think about, but we are going to try and make the best solutions for our gamers at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. For the next question, we have the line from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I guess a follow-up question on the supply constraints. When do you think that they'll ease? And how should we think about gaming into the January quarter vis-a-vis typical seasonality, given -- I would assume you would continue to be supply constrained. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Colette, I can take it or you can. Either one of us.\nColette Kress: Go ahead Jensen and I'll follow it up if there are some other things,\nJensen Huang: Okay. We're supply constraint in graphics and we're supplying constraining graphics while we're delivering record revenues in graphics. Cloud gaming is growing, cloud graphics is growing. RTX made it possible for us to address the design in the creative workstations. Historically the rendering of ray tracing and photorealistic images have largely been done on CPUs.  And for the very first time, and you could actually accelerate it with NVIDIA GPUs and with RTX GPUs. And so the workstation market is really doing great. The backdrop of that of course is that people are building offices in their homes.  And for many of the designers and creators of our worlds and 20 million of them, they have to create -- they have to build a workstation or an office at home as well as build one at work [Indiscernible] And meanwhile, of course, RTX has reached that -- all of our consumer graphics with the 200 million installed base of PC gamers, and it's time to upgrade.  And so there's a whole bunch of reasons when choosing referenced revenues while we're on supply constraints. We have enough supply to meet our second-half Company growth plans. And next year, we expect to be able to achieve our Company's growth plans for next year.  Meanwhile, we're having and are securing pretty significant long-term supply commitments as we expand into all these different marketing initiatives that we've set ourselves up for. And so I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment.  But a lot of that has to do with the fact that our demand is just too great. RTX is really a once-in-a-generation reset of the computer -- modern computer graphics. Nothing like this has happened [Indiscernible] computer graphics. And so the invention is really [Indiscernible] and you could see its impact.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results outlook and execution. The Mellanox networking franchise -- this has been a really strong and synergistic addition to the video compute portfolio.  I think kind of near to midterm the team is benefiting from the transition to 200 and 400-gig networking connectivity and Cloud and Hyperscale. And then I think in addition to that, you guys are getting some good traction with the Bluefield smart tech products.  Can you just give us a sense of how the business is trending year-over-year, and do you expect continued quarter-over-quarter networking momentum into the second half of this year, especially as the cloud and hyperscalers are going through a server and Capex spending cycle?\nJensen Huang: Yeah, I really appreciate that question. Now, the heaviest solid growth quarter, and the Mellanox networking business have really grown incredibly. There are three dynamics happening all at the same time. The first is the transition that you're talking about. You know that the world's data center [Indiscernible] centers are users for computing costs just aggregated, which basically means with a single application is running on multiple servers at the same time.  This is what makes it possible for them to scale up. The more users for an AI application or service, you just have to add more servers. And so the ease of scale-out that this aggregated computing provides also puts enormous pressure on the networking.  And that Mellanox has the world's lowest latency and the highest bandwidth and performance networking on the planet. And so the ability to scale out and the ability to provide this aggregate in applications are really much, much better with Mellanox networking. So that's number one.  Number two, almost every Company in the world has to be a high-performance computing Company now. You see that the cloud service providers, one after another, are building effective supercomputers. Historically was [Indiscernible] and supercomputing firms, the cloud-service providers have to build supercomputers themselves.  And the reason for that is because artificial intelligence entombs gigantic models. The rate of growth of network sizes AI models buys this is doubled every two months. It's doubling not every year or 2 years, it's doubling every 2 months. And so you can imagine the size when I'm talking about trending AI models that are 100 trillion parameters large.  The human brain has a 150 plus trillion synopsis, and so for nuance. And so that gives you a sense of the scale of AI models that people are developing. And so you're going to see supercomputers that are built out of Mellanox, InfiniBand, and their high-speed networking, along with NVIDIA GPU computing in more and more cloud service providers.  You're also seeing it in enterprises or used in the discovery of [Indiscernible] there is our digital mileage and revolution going on as a computation statement. The large-scale computing that we're able to do now and AI, better understand biology and better understand chemistry, and bringing both of those skills into the field of Information Sciences. And so you're seeing large supercomputers growth in enterprises around the world as well.  And so the second dynamic has to do with our incredibly great networking InfiniBand networking, which was the de facto standard in high-performance computing. And the third dynamic is the Data Center\u2019s storing software. In order to orchestrate and run a data center, with just a few people essentially running their entire data center, hundreds of thousands of servers it is just one computer in front of you.  That entire data center is software-defined. And the amount of software that goes into that software-defined data center running on today's GPUs is the networking stack, the storage stack, and now, because of zero trusts, the security stack. All of that is putting enormous pressure on the available computing capacity for applications, which is ultimately what data centers are designed to do.  And so for the software-defined data center needs to have a place to take infrastructure software and accelerate it, to offload it, to accelerate it. And very important to isolate it from the application plan, so that intruders can't jump into the operating system with your all -- of your data center, establish of your data center.  And so the answer to that is detailed, the ability to offload, accelerate, and isolate this -- the data center software infrastructure, and to fully up to all the -- your CPUs through to run what they're supposed to run, which is the application. Now, just about every data center in the world is moving towards a zero-trust model and Bluefield is just incredibly well-positioned.  For these three dynamics, this aggregated computing, which needs really strong and fast networking, every Company needing high-performance computing, and then lastly, software decline in data centers going zero trusts.  And so these are really important dynamics and I appreciate the opportunity to tell you all that. And you can just tell how super excited I'm about the prospects in the networking business and in the importance that they have in building modern data centers.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I think you hit on a lot of my questions around the Data Center in that last. So maybe I will just ask the kind of on a P&L basis, one of the things that I see in the results, or more importantly, the guide is you're now collect guiding over a 67% gross margin, potentially.  I'm curious as we move forward, how do you think about the incremental operating gross margin upside still from here, and how you're thinking about the operating merchant leverage for the Company from here through the P&L. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Let me take that and then you could just follow up --\nColette Kress: Go forth.\nJensen Huang: -- With details, that'll be great. I think at the highest level -- I really appreciate the question. At the highest level, the important thing to realize is that artificial intelligence, is the single greatest technology force that the computer industry has ever seen and potentially the world's ever seen.  The automation opportunities -- automation opportunity, which drives productivity, which translates directly the cost savings to companies, is enormous. And it opens up opportunities for technology and computing Companies like it's never happened before. And let me just give you some examples.  The fact that we could apply so much technology to warehouse logistics, retail automation, customer call center automation, is really quite unprecedented. The fact that we could automate truck driving and [Indiscernible] delivery, providing an automated chauffeur. Those kinds of services and benefits and products are never imaginable before.  And so the size of the IT industry if you will, the industry that computer companies like ourselves are part of, has expanded from them before. And so -- the thing that we want to do is to invest as smartly, but as quickly as we can to go after the large business opportunities, where we can make a real impact.  And while doing so, to do so in a way that is architecturally sensible. One of the things that is really an advantage of our Company is the nature of the way that we build products, the nature of the way that we build software, our discipline around the architecture, which allows us to be so efficient while addressing climate science, on the one hand, digital biology on the other, artificial intelligence and robotics and self-driving cars.  And of course, we always talked about computer graphics and video. Using one architecture and having the ability to -- and having the discipline now for almost 30 years has given us incredible operating leverage. That's where the vast majority of our operating leverage comes from, which is architectural.  The technologies are architectural, our products are architectural in that way, and the Company is even built architecturally in that way. And so hopefully, as we go after these large, large market opportunities that AI has provided us, and we do so in a smart and disciplined way, with great leverage through our architecture, we can continue to drive really great operating leverage for the Company and for our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question, which comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I apologize for the short-term nature of the question, but it's what I get asked most frequently. I want to return to the impact of crypto or the potential impact of crypto.  Colette or Jensen, is there any way to gauge the effectiveness of the low hash rate GeForce, why only 80% and not 100%? And how confident are you that the CMP business being down is a reflection of crypto cooling-off versus perhaps LHR not being that effective?  And I bring it up because there's a lot of blogs out there that would suggest that there -- as much as you guys are trying to limit the ability of miners to use GeForce, there are some workarounds.\nJensen Huang: Yes. There -- go ahead.\nColette Kress: Let me start there and answer a couple of the questions about our strategy that we've put in place in this last couple of quarters. As you recall, what we put in place was the low hash rate cards, as well as putting industry [Indiscernible] cards.  The low hash rate cards were to provide for more supply for our GeForce gamers that are out there. We articulated one of the metrics that we were looking at is what percentage of those cards in Ampere, we were able to sell with low-rate hash cards. Almost all of our cards in Ampere are low hash rates, but also we're selling other types of cards as well.  But at this time, as we move forward, we're much higher than 80%, but just at the end of this last quarter, we were approximately at 80. So yes, that is moving up, so the strategy is in place and we'll continue as we move into Q3. I'll move it to Jensen here to see if he can discuss it further.\nJensen Huang: There's the question about the strategy of how we're scaling GeForce supply to games. We moved incredibly fast this time with CMPs, and with our LHR settings for GeForce. And our entire strategy is about steering GeForce supply to the industry.  And we have every reason to believe that because of the drive-in gaming, which is really a measure of gamers, the rate of growth of theme adoption of our GPUs, there's some evidence that that was successful. But there are somewhat reasons why it's just different this time.  The first reason, of course, is that the LHR, which is new, and the speed at which we responded with CMPs, steered GeForce to fight the damage. The second is where at the very beginning of the Ampere and RTX graphics.  As I mentioned earlier, RTX was a complete re-invention of computer graphics. Every evidence is that gamers are incredible -- and game developers are incredibly excited about ray tracing, this form of computer renderings. Graphics rendering is just dramatically more beautiful. And we're at the beginning of that cycle, and only 20% has been upgraded so far.  We have 80% to go in a market that is already quite large and an installed base that's quite low but also growing. Last year, the gamers grew 20% and just [Indiscernible]. The third reserves that our demand is strong and our channel weak, and you can see what we're doing with the shortage of supply as quickly as we're shipping it. It's virtually all of the worlds.  And then lastly, and we just have more growth drivers today because of RTX whenever. We have the biggest wave of NVIDIA laptops, just the laptops are our fastest-growing segment of computing and we have the largest wave of laptops coming.  The demand for RTX and Workstation, whereas previously the Workstation market was a slow-growing market is now a fast-growing market and its achieved record. And after more than a decade of working on cloud graphics, our cloud graphics is in great demand. And so all of these segments are seeing high demand while we continue to supply them [Indiscernible] so I think the situations are very different and RTX is making a huge difference.\nOperator: Thank you. We have the next question, which comes from the line of Chris Casper (phon) of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nChris Casper: Thank you. Good evening. My question is about the split between the Hyperscale in the vertical customers in the Data Center business and the trends you see in each. I think in your prepared remarks, you said both would be up in the October quarter.  But I'm interested to see if you're seeing any different trends there, particularly in the vertical business, as perhaps business conditions normalize and Companies return to the office, and they adjust their spending plans accordingly.\nColette Kress: Yes. Let me start to outlook the question and I'll let Jensen [Indiscernible]. So far with our Data Center business, with our Q2 results, our vertical industry is still quite a strong percentage. Essentially, 50% of our data center business is going to our vertical industries.  Our Hyperscale s makes up the other portion of that, slightly below the 50%. And then we also have our supercomputing business with a very small percentage of it doing quite, quite well.  As we move into Q3, as we've discussed, we will see an acceleration of both our vertical industries and our Hyperscales as we move into Q3. With that backdrop, we'll see if Jensen has additional commentary.\nJensen Huang: There is a fundamental difference in the Hyperscale use of HPC or AI versus the industrial use of HPC Internet. In the world of hyperscalers and Internet service providers, they're making recommendations on movies, and songs, and articles, and search results, and so on, so forth.  And the improvement that I can see that deep learning and artificial intelligence large recommender systems that can provide is really working for them. In the world of industry, the reason why artificial intelligence is transformative. Recognizing that most of the things that I just mentioned earlier, it's not moving on dynamics in the world's largest industries, whether it helps healthcare or in logistics or transportation or retail.  The vast majority of the reasons why, and some of the physical sciences industries, whether it's energy or transportation, and also for healthcare. The simulation of physics, the simulation of the world, was not achievable using traditional first principle simulation approaches. But artificial intelligence or data-driven approaches have completely shaken that up and put it on its head.  Some examples, whether it's fusing artificial intelligence so then you could feed up the simulation or the prediction of the approaching structure or the 3D structure approaching, which was recently achieved by a couple of very important networks, it's ground-breaking.  And by understanding the approaching structure, 3D structure, we understand -- that we can better understand its function and how it would adapt to other approach and other [Indiscernible] And it's a fundamental step of the process in drug discovery and that has just taken a giant leap forward. In the areas of chronic science, it is now possible to consider using data-driven approaches to create models that overcome this -- not overcome but accelerate and make it possible for us to simulate much larger simulations of Multi-Physics Geometry aware simulations, which is basically climate science.  These are really important fields of work that wouldn't have been possible for another decade at least. And just as we've made possible, using artificial intelligence, the realization of real-time ray tracing in every field of science, whether its climate simulation, energy discovery, drug discovery.  We're starting to see that the industry recognizing that the fusion of the first principle simulation and data-driven artificial intelligence approaches, it's going to get a giant leap up. And that is a second dynamic.  The other dynamic for the industry is for the very first time they can deploy AI model out to the edge to do a better job with agriculture, to do a better job with asset protection and warehouses, to do a better job with automating retail, AI is going to make it possible for all of these types of automation to finally be realized.  And so the dynamics are all very different. That last one has to do with Edge AI, which was just made possible by putting AI right at the point of data and right at the point of action because you need to be low cost, you need to be high performance, and instantly responsive, and you can't afford to stream all of the data to the cloud all the time. And so each one of them has a partially different understanding.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Silgan Stein (phon) of [Indiscernible] Your line is open.\nSilgan Stein: Great, thanks so much for taking my question. Jensen, I'm wondering if you can talk for a moment about Omniverse. This looks like really cool technology, but I tend to get very few questions from investors about it, but It looks to me like this could be a potentially very meaningful technology for you longer-term.  Can you explain perhaps what capabilities and what markets this is going after? It looks like, perhaps this is going to position you very well in augmented and virtual reality, but maybe it's a different market or group of markets. It's a bit confusing to us, so if you could maybe help us understand it, I think we'd really appreciate it. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: I really appreciate the question. And it's one of the most important things we're doing. The Omniverse, first of all, just what is it? Is a stimulator. It's a simulator that's physically accurate and physically based. And it was made possible because of two fundamental technologies we invented. One of them is, of course, RTX, the ability to physically stimulate light behaviour in the world, which is very fixing.  The second is the ability to compute or simulate the physics of -- simulate the artificial intelligence behaviour of agents and objects inside a world. So we have the ability now to simulate physics in a realistic way and to create a new architecture that allows us to do it in the cloud, distribute it a computed way, and to be able to scale it out to a very large [Indiscernible] So the question is what would you do with such a thing.  The simulator, there is a simulation of virtual worlds with portals -- we call them connectors -- portals based on an industry-standard, open standard that was pioneered by Pixar, and as we mentioned earlier, that we're partnering with Pixar and Apple to make it even more broadly adopted. It's called USD, Universal Scene Description. They're basically portals or wormholes into virtual worlds.  And this virtual world will simulate -- to be simulating -- it could be a concert for consumers, it could be a theme park for consumers. In the world of industries, you could use it for simulating robots so that robots could learn how to be robots inside these virtual worlds before they're downloaded from the simulator to the real world. You could use it to simulate factories, which is one of the early works that we've done with BMW.  We've got a shared GTC Factory of the Future that is designed completely in Omniverse, robots trading Omniverse with goods and materials that are its original CAD data put into the battery. The logistics plan, like an ERP system, except this an ERP system of physical grids and physical simulation simulated through this Omniverse world, and you could plan the entire factory in Omniverse.  This entire factory now becomes what is called the digital twin. In fact, it could be a factor, it could be a stadium, it could be an airport, it could be an entire city, it could even include the cars. The digital twin would allow us to simulate new algorithms, new AIs, new and optimization algorithms before we deploy them into the physical world.  And so what is Omniverse? Well, Omniverse is going to be an overlay, if you will, of virtual worlds, that increasingly people call the Metaverse. And we've now heard several companies talk about the Metaverse. They all come from different perspectives. Some of them from social perspectives, some are here from a gaming perspective, some of them, in our case, from an industrial and design and engineering perspective.  But the Omniverse is essentially an overlay of the Internet -- an overlay of the physical world and it's going to fuse all these different worlds together long-term. And you'll be able to -- you mentioned VR, and now you'll be able to go into the Omniverse worlds using virtual reality. And so you wormhole into the virtual worlds using VR.  You could have an AI or an object portal into our world using augmented reality so you could have a beautiful piece of art that you've somehow purchased and belongs to you because of [Indiscernible] and it's only enjoyed in the virtual world and you can overlay it into your physical world using AI.  I'm fairly sure at this point that Omniverse or the Metaverse is going to be a new economy that is larger than our current economy. And we'll enjoy a lot of our time in the future in Omniverse and the Metaverse, and we'll do a lot of our work there, and we'll have a lot of robots. They're doing a lot of the work on our behalf.  We've got the [Indiscernible] they show the results. Omniverse to us is an extension of our AI strategy, is an extension of our high-performance computing strategy, and it makes it possible for companies and industries to be able to create digital tools that simulate their physical version before they deploy it or while they are operating.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. We had an excellent quarter fueled by surging demand for NVIDIA computing. Our pioneering work in accelerated computing continues to vent graphics, scientific computing with AI. Enabled by NVIDIA accelerated computing, developers are creating the most impactful technologies of our time.  From natural language understanding, invest in many systems, to autonomous vehicles, and in the logistics centers, to digital biology and climate science research, the Metaverse world that obeys the laws of physics.  This quarter we announced NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command to develop deploy, scale, and orchestrate the AI workflow that runs on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite. With our new Enterprise Software, a wide range of NVIDIA-powered systems, and a global network of system and integration partners, we can accelerate the world's largest industry as they raise the benefits from the transformative power of AI.  We are thrilled to have launched NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform nearly five years in the making that runs physically realistic virtual worlds and connects to other digital platforms. We imagine engineers, designers, and even autonomous machines connecting to Omniverse to create digital twin simulated worlds that help train robots, operating autonomous factories, simulate fleets and autonomous vehicles, and even predict the human impact on Earth's climate.  The future will have artificial intelligence augmenting our own and the Metaverse augmenting our physical world. It will be populated by real and AI visitors, and open new opportunities for artists, designers, scientists, and even businesses, a whole new digital economy [Indiscernible] Omniverse is a platform for building the Metaverse vision.  We're doing some of our best work and most impactful work in our history. I want to thank all of NVIDIA's employees for the remaining work and the exciting future we're inventing together. Thank you. See you next time.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q1 was exceptionally strong with revenue of $5.66 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 84%. We set a record in total revenue in gaming, data center and professional visualization driven by our best ever product lineups and structural tailwinds across our businesses. Starting with gaming. Revenue of $2.8 billion was up 11% sequentially and up 106% from a year earlier. This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth, beginning with the fall launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the Ampere GPU architecture, the 30 Series has been our most successful launch ever, driving incredible demand and setting records for both desktop and laptop GPU sales. Channel inventories are still leading, and we expect to remain supply constrained into the second half of the year. With our Ampere GPU architecture now ramping across the stack in both desktop and laptops, we expect the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade. Laptops continue to drive strong growth this quarter as we started ramping the Ampere GPU architecture across our lineup. Earlier this month, all major PC OEMs launch GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops based on the 3080, 39 -- 3070 and 3060 as part of their spring refresh. In addition, mainstream versions based on the 3050 and 3050 Ti will be available this summer, just in time for back-to-school starting at price points as low as 799. This is the largest ever wave of GeForce gaming laptops over 140 in total, as OEMs address the rising demand from gamers, creators and students for NVIDIA's powered laptops. The RTX 30 Series delivers our biggest generational leap in performance ever. It also features our second-generation ray tracing technology and frame rate boosting, AI-powered DLSS. The RTX is a reset for graphics with over 60 accelerated games. This quarter, we added many more, including Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Crysis Remastered and Outriders. We also announced that DLSS is now available in Unreal Engine 4 and soon in the Unity game engine, enabling game developers to accelerate frame rates with minimal effort. The RTX 30 Series also offers NVIDIA Reflex, a new technology that reduces system latency. Reflex is emerging as a must-have feature for e-sports gamers who play competitive titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, Valorant and Apex Legends. We estimate that about 75% of GeForce gamers play e-sports games and 99% of e-sports pros compete on GeForce. We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent. We've taken actions to optimize GeForce GPUs for gamers, while separately addressing mining demand with Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, or CMPs. Last week, we announced that newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphic cards will have their Ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half and carry a low hash rate or LHR identifier. Along with the updated RTX 3060, this should allow our partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices. To help address mining demand, CMP products launched this quarter, optimized for mining performance and efficiency because they don't meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU, they don't impact the supply of GeForce GPUs to gamers. CMP revenue was $155 million in Q1 reported as part of the OEM and other category. And our Q2 outlook assumes CMP sales of $400 million. Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform passed 10 million registered numbers this quarter. GFN offers nearly 1,000 PC games from over 300 publishers more than any other cloud gaming service, including 80 of the most popular free to game play games. GFN expands the reach of GeForce to billions of under powered Windows PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, Android devices, iPhones and iPads. GFN is offered in over 70 countries with our latest expansions, including Australia, Singapore and South America. Moving to Pro Vis. Q1 revenue was $372 million, up 21% both sequentially and year-on-year. Strong notebook growth was driven by a new sleek and powerful RTX-powered mobile workstations with Max-Q technology and the enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Desktop workstations rebounded as enterprise resumed the spending that has been deferred during the lockdown with continued growth likely as offices open. Key verticals driving Q1 demand include manufacturing, healthcare, automotive and media and entertainment. At GTC, we announced the coming general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, the world's first technology platform that enables global 3D design teams to collaborate in real-time in a shared space working across multiple software speeds. This incredible technology builds on NVIDIA's entire body of work and is supported by a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Early adopters include sophisticated design teams and some of the world's leading companies such as BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP. Over 400 companies have been evaluating Omniverse and nearly 17,000 users have downloaded the open beta. Omniverse is offered as a software subscription on a per user and a per server basis. As the world becomes more digital, virtual and collaborative, we see a significant revenue opportunity for Omniverse. We also announced powerful new Ampere architecture GPUs for next-generation desktop and laptop workstation. The new RTX-powered workstations will be available from all major OEMs. Moving to Automotive. Q1 revenue was $154 million, up 6% sequentially and down 1% year-on-year. Growth in AI cockpit revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in legacy infotainment revenue. We extended our technology leadership with the announcement of the next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan SoC. Atlan will deliver an unrivalled 1,000 trillion operations per second of performance and integrate data center class NVIDIA BlueField networking and security technologies to enhance vehicle performance and safety, making it a true data center on wheels. Atlan, which targets automakers\u2019 2025 models, will follow the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC, which delivers 254 TOPS that has been selected by leading vehicle makers for production timelines starting next year. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform has achieved global adoption across the transportation industry. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds 8 billion through fiscal 2027. Most recently, Volvo Cars announced that it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin building on our next great momentum with some of the largest automakers including Mercedes Benz, SAIC and Hyundai Motor Group. In robotaxi's we added GM Cruise to the growing number of companies adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, which includes Amazon Zoox and DiDi. We\u2019ve also had a great traction with new energy vehicle makers. Our latest wins include Faraday Future, R Auto, IM Motors and VinFast, which join previously announced wins with SAIC, NIO, XPeng and Li Auto. And in trucking, Navistar is partnered with TuSimple in selecting NVIDIA DRIVE for autonomous driving, joining previously announced robo autonomous solutions and plus. NVIDIA is helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. Our full stack software defined AV and AI cockpit platform spans silicon, systems, software and AI data center infrastructure, enabling over the air upgrades to enhance safety and the joy of driving throughout the vehicles lifetime. Starting with our lead partner Mercedes Benz, NVIDIA DRIVE can transform the automotive industry with amazing technologies delivered through a new software and services business models. Moving to data center. Revenue topped $2 billion for the first time, growing 8% sequentially and up 79% from the year-ago quarter, which did not include Mellanox. Hyperscale customers led our growth this quarter, as they built infrastructure to commercialize a AI in their services. In addition, cloud providers have adopted the A100 to support growing demand for AI for enterprises, startups and research organizations. Customers have deployed NVIDIA's A100 and DGX platforms to train deep neural networks with rising computational intensity led by two of the fastest growing areas of AI; natural language understanding and deep recommendators. In March, Google Cloud Platform announced general availability of the A100 with early customers including square for its cash application and Alphabet\u2019s DeepMind. The A100 is deployed across all major hyperscale and cloud service providers globally. And we see strengthening demand in the coming quarters. Every industry is becoming a technology industry and accelerating investments in AI infrastructure, both through the cloud and on-premise. Our vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year led by consumer internet companies. For example, NAVER, a leading internet technology company in Korea and Japan is training giant AI language models at scale on DGX SuperPOD to pioneer new services across e-commerce, search, entertainment and payment applications. We continue to gain traction in France with hyperscale and vertical industry customers across a broadening portfolio of GPOs. We had record shipments of GPUs used for inference. Inference growth is driving not just the T4, which was up strongly in the quarter, but also the universal A100 Tensor Core GPU as well as the new Ampere architecture based A10 and A30 GPUs, all excellent at training as well as inferencing. Customers are increasingly migrated from CPUs to GPUs for AI inference for two chief reasons. First, GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and the complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency. In April's MLPerf AI inference benchmark, NVIDIA achieved the top results across every category that include computer vision, medical imaging, recommender systems, speech recognition and natural language processing. And second, NVIDIA's full stack inference platform including tritons and inference server software simplifies the complexity of deploying AI applications by supporting models from all major frameworks, and optimizing for different query types including batch, real time and streaming. Triton is supported by several partners in the cloud services, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tencent. Examples of how customers use NVIDIA's inference platform include Microsoft for grammar checking in office, the United States Postal Service for real time package analytics, T-Mobile for customer service, Pinterest for image search, and GE Healthcare for heart disease detection. We also have strong results with Mellanox networking products. Like our compute business, strong growth was driven by hyperscale customers across both Ethernet and InfiniBand. We achieved key design wins and proof-of-concept trials for the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU, the cloud service providers and consumer internet companies. We also unveiled BlueField-3, the first DPU built for AI and accelerated computing, with support from VMware, Splunk, NetApp, Cloudflare and others. BlueField-3 is the industry's first 400 gig DPU and delivers the equivalent data center services of up to 300 CPU cores. It transforms traditional server infrastructure into zero trust environments in which every user is authenticated by offloading and isolating data center services for business applications. With BlueField-3, our DPU roadmap will deliver an unrivalled 100x performance increase over a 3-year period. As we look back at the first full year since closing the Mellanox acquisition, we are extremely pleased with how the business has performed. It has not only exceeded our financial projections, but it has been instrumental in key new platforms like the DGX SuperPOD and the BlueField DPU, enabling our data center scale computing strategy. In April, we held our largest ever GPU Technology Conference with more than 200,000 registrants from 195 countries. Jensen's keynote has over 14 million views. At GTC, we announced our first data center CPU, NVIDIA Grace, targeted at processing massive next generation AI models with trillions of parameters. The arm-based processor will enable 10x the performance and energy efficiency of today's fastest servers. With Grace, NVIDIA has a three-chip strategy with GPU, DPU and now CPU. The Swiss National Supercomputing Center and the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace powered supercomputers. Grace will be available in early 2023. GTC is first and foremost for developers. We announced NVIDIA developed and optimized pre-trained model availability on the NVIDIA GPU cloud registry. Developers can choose a pre-trained model and adapt it to fit their specific needs using NVIDIA TAO, our transfer learning software. TAO fine tunes the model with customers own small dataset to get models accustomed without the cost, fine and massive data sets required to train a neural net -- a neural network from scratch. Once a model is optimized and ready for deployment, users can integrate it with an NVIDIA application framework that fits their use. For example, the NVIDIA Jarvis framework for interactive conversational AI is now generally available and used by customers such as T-Mobile and Snap and the NVIDIA Merlin framework for deep recommendators is an open beta with customers such as Snap and Tencent. With the chosen application framework, users can launch NVIDIA Fleet Command software to deploy and manage the AI application across a variety of NVIDIA GPU powered devices. For enterprise customers, we unveiled a new enterprise grade software offering available as a perpetual license or subscription. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of AI software that speeds development and deployment of AI workloads and simplifies management of enterprise AI infrastructure. Through our partnership with VMware hundreds of thousands of vSphere customers will be able to purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise with the same familiar pricing model that IT managers use to procure VMware infrastructure software. We also made several announcement at GTC about accelerating the delivery of both NVIDIA AI and accelerated computing to enterprises and edge users among the world's largest industries. Leading server OEMs launched NVIDIA certified systems, which are industry standard servers based on the NVIDIA EGX platform. They run NVIDIA AI enterprise software and are supported by the NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs. Initial customers including Lockheed Martin and Mass General Brigham. In addition, we announced the NVIDIA AI on 5G platform supported on NVIDIA EGX servers to enable high performance 5G Ram and AI applications. The AI on 5G platform leverages the NVIDIA Aerial software and the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 converged card which combines our GPUs and DPUs. We are teaming with Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Mavenir, Radisys and Wind River in developing solutions based on our AI on 5G platform to speed the creation of smart cities and factories, advanced hospitals and intelligent stores. Another highlight at GTC was the announcement of a broad range of initiatives to strengthen the Arm ecosystem across cloud data centers, HPC, enterprise and edge and PCs. In the cloud, we are bringing together AWS Graviton2 processors and NVIDIA DPUs to provide a range of benefits including lower costs, support for virtual game streaming experiences and greater performance for Arm based workloads. In HPC, we are bringing together an Ampere Altra CPU with NVIDIA GPUs, DPUs and NVIDIA HPC software development kit. Initial supercomputing centers deployed include Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Labs. In the Enterprise and Edge, we're bringing together Marvell Arm-based OCTEON processors and the NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate video analytics and cybersecurity solutions. And in PCs, we are bringing together MediaTek's Arm-based processors with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to enable realistic ray trace graphics and cutting-edge AI in a new class of Arm-based laptops. On our Arm acquisition, we are making steady progress in working with the regulators across key regions. We remain on track to close the transaction within our original timeframe of early 2022. Arm's IP is widely used, but the company needs a partner that can help it achieve new heights. NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to enhance Arm's capabilities, and we are committed to invest in developing the Arm ecosystem, enhancing R&D, adding IP and turbo charging its development to grow into new markets in the data center, IoT and embedded devices, areas where it only has a light footprint or in some cases, none at all. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 100 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points from a year earlier and up 70 basis points sequentially. The sequential non-GAAP increase was largely driven by a more favorable mix within data center and the addition of CMP products. Q1 GAAP EPS was $3.03, up 106% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, up 103% from a year-ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect broad base sequential year-on-year revenue growth in all of our market platforms. Our outlook includes $400 million in CMP. Aside from CMP, the sequential revenue increase in our Q2 outlook is driven largely by data center and gaming. In data center, we expect sequential growth in both compute and networking. In gaming, with the move to low hash rate G4 CPUs, and increasing the amount of CMP products, we are making a significant effort to serve miners with CMPs and provide more GeForce cards to gamers. If there is additional CMP demand, we have supplied flexibility to support it. We believe these actions combined with strong gaming demand will drive an increase in our core gaming business for Q2. Now to look at our outlook for Q2. Revenue is expected to be $6.3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.6% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.76 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP, other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight that Jeff Fisher and Manuvir Das will keynote Computex on the evening of May 31 U.S time, as well as several upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending the Evercore TMT Conference on June 7, the BofA 2021 Global Technology Conference on June 9, and the NASDAQ Virtual Investor Conference on June 16. Our earnings call to discuss our second quarter results is scheduled for Wednesday, August 18. With now, we will open the call for question. Operator, would you please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Colette, I was wondering if you can double click a little more on the guidance. I know of the 600 to 650 in growth, you said 250 is coming from CMP and both gaming and data center will be up. Can we assume that they're up about equally, so you're getting about 200 roughly from each of those? And I guess second part of that is, within data center, I'm wondering can you speak to the networking piece. It sounds like maybe it was up a bit more modestly than it's been up the past few quarters. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yes. Thanks so much for the question on our guidance. So I first want to start off with, we see demand really across all of our markets. All of our different market platforms we do plan to grow sequentially. You are correct, that we are expecting an increase in our CMP. And outside of our CMP growth, we expect the lion share of our growth to come from our data center and gaming. In our data center business, right now, our product lineup couldn't be better. We have a strong overall portfolio, both for training and for inferencing and we're seeing strong demand across our hyperscales and vertical industries. We've made a deliberate effort on the gaming perspective to supply to our gamers the cards that they would like, given the strong demand that we see. So that will also support the sequential growth that we are receiving. So you are correct, that we do see it - growth sequentially coming from data center and gaming, both contributing quite well to our growth.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Colette.\nColette Kress: Oh, I didn't answer your second question, my apologies, on Mellanox. Additionally, Mellanox is an important part of our data center. It is quite integrated with our overall products. We did continue to see growth this last quarter and we are also expecting them to sequentially grow as we move into Q2. They are a smaller part of our overall data center business, but again, we do expect them to grow.\nOperator: And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, I think I heard you talk about a vision for acceleration in data center as we go through the year. And as you think about the purchase obligations that you reported up 45% year-on-year, how much of that is related to long lead time data center and how should we interpret that in terms of what kind of ramp we could see in the second half, particularly as you think about perhaps adding more growth from enterprise on top of what was hyperscale-driven growth in the April quarter? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let me take the first part of your question regarding our purchasing of inventory and what we're seeing in just both our purchase commitments and our inventory. The market has definitely changed to where long lead times are required to build out our data center products. So we're on a steady stream to both commit longer-term, so that we can make sure that we can serve our customers with the great lineup of products that we have. So yes, a good part of those purchase commitments is really about those long lead times, the components to create the full systems. I will turn the second part of the question over to Jensen.\nJensen Huang: What was the second part of the question, Colette?\nColette Kress: Second part of the question was, what do we see in the second half as it relates to the lineup of enterprise. And we articulated in our pre-remarks regarding - that we see an acceleration. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. We're seeing strength across the board in data centers, and we're seeing strengthening demand. C.J., our data center, as you know, is accelerated with a range of applications. From scientific computing, both physical and life sciences, data analytics, and classical machine learning, cloud computing and cloud graphics, which is becoming more important because of remote work. And very importantly, AI both for training as well as inferencing for classical machine learning models, like XGBoost all the way to deep learning-based models like conversational AI, natural language, understanding, recommender systems, and so on. And so we have a large suite of applications and our NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC as the case, accelerate these applications and data centers. They run on systems that range from HGX for the hyperscalers to DGX for on-prem to EGX for Enterprise and Edge, all the way out to AGX autonomous systems. And this quarter, at GTC, we announced one of our largest initiatives and it's taken us several years. You've seen working on it in open -- on the open over the course of the last several years, and it's called EGX, it's our Enterprise AI platform. We're democratizing AI, we're bringing it out in cloud, we're bringing it to enterprises, and we're bringing it out to the Edge. And the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world at the automation that has to be done has data that has data sovereignty issues, or data rate issues that can't move to the cloud easily. And so we have to move the computing to their premise and oftentimes all the way up to the edge. The platform has to be secure, has to be confidential, it has to be remotely manageable. And of course, it has to be high-performance and it has to be cloud-native. And that's the built -- be built like the cloud, the modern way of doing cloud data centers. And so these stacks has to be modern on the one hand, it has to be integrated into classical enterprise systems on the other hand, which is the reason why we\u2019ve worked so closely with VMware and accelerated VMware's operating system, data center operating system, software-defined data center, stacks on BlueField. Meanwhile, we ported NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA HPC on to VMware, so that they could run distributed large scale accelerated computing for the very first time. And that partnership, that partnership was announced at VMworld. It was announced at GTC and we're in the process of going to market with all of our enterprise partners, their OEMs, their value-added resellers, their service -- their solution integrators all over the world.  And so, this is a really large endeavor and the early indications of it are really exciting. And the reason for that is because as you know, our data center business is more than 50% vertical industry enterprise already. It's more than 50% vertical industry enterprises already and then by creating this easy to adapt and easy to integrate stack, it's going to allow them to move a lot faster. And so this is the next major wave of AI. This is a very exciting part of our initiative. And it's something that I've been working on for -- we've been working on for quite a long time. And so I'm delighted with the launch this quarter at GTC. The rest of the data centers do agree to. As Colette mentioned, hyperscale demand is strengthening. We're seeing that for computing and networking. You know that the world's cloud data centers are moving to deep learning, because every small percentage that they get out of predictive inference drives billions and billions of dollars of economics for them. And so the movement towards deep learning shifts the data center workload away from CPUs, because accelerators are so important. And so hyperscale, we're seeing great traction and great demand.  And then lastly, supercomputing. Supercomputer centers all over the world are building out. And we're really in a great position there to fuse for the very first-time simulation-based approaches as well as data driven based approaches what is called artificial intelligence. And so across the board, our data center is gaining momentum. And we see -- we just see great strength right now and its growing strength. And we're really set up for years of growth in data center. This is the largest segment of computing as you know, and this segment of computing is going to continue to grow for some time to come.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results. I'm going to first slip in two of them here. First of all, Colette, I think in the past you talked about how much of your gaming install base is kind of on the pre-race ray tracing platforms are really kind of the context behind the upgrade cycle that's still part of us. That's kind of question one. And then, on the heels of the last question, I was just curious things like VMware's project model ray as we think about the BlueField-2 product and BlueField-3, how should we think about those starting to become or when should they become really material incremental revenue growth contributors for the company? Thank you.\nColette Kress: So, yes, we have definitely discussed in terms of the great opportunity that we have in front of us of folks moving to our ray traced GPUs. And we're in the early stages of that. We've had a strong cycle already, but still we probably have approximately 15% moving up a little bit from that at this time. So it's a great opportunity for us to continue to upgrade a good part of that install base, not only just with our desktop GPUs, but the RTX laptops are also a great driver of growth and upgrading folks to RTX.\nJensen Huang: Colette, do you want me to take the second one?\nColette Kress: Yes, please.\nJensen Huang: Aaron, a good -- great question on BlueField. First of all, the modern data center has to be rearchitected for several reasons. There are several fundamental reasons that makes it very, very clear that the architecture has to change. The first insight is cloud-native, which means that a data center is shared for everybody. [Indiscernible] you don't know who's coming and going and it's exposed to everybody on the internet. Number two, you have to assume that it's a Zero Trust environment because you don't know who's using it. It used to be that we have perimeter security, but those days are gone because it's cloud-native, it's remote access, it's multi tenant, it's public cloud, the infrastructure is used for internal and external applications. So number two has to be -- it has to be zero trust. The third reason is something that started a long time ago, which is software defined in every way, because you want -- you don't want a whole bunch of bespoke custom gear inside a data center, you want to avoid the data center with software. You want to be software defined. The software defined data center movement enabled this one pane of glass, a few IT managers orchestrating millions and millions of nodes of computers at one place. And the software runs what used to be storage, networking, security, virtualization and all of that -- all of those things have become a lot larger and a lot more intensive. And it's consuming a lot of the data center. In fact, the estimate depending on how you want to think about it, how much security you want to put on it, if you assume that it's a zero trust data center, probably half of the CPU cores inside the data center is running not applications. And that's kind of strange, because you created the data center to run services and applications, which is the only thing that makes money. The other half of the computing is completely soaked up running the software defined data center just to provide for those applications. And that you could imagine even accepting, if you like, as the cost of doing business. However, it commingles the infrastructure, the security plane and the application plane and exposes the data center to attackers. And so you fundamentally want to change the architecture as a result of that. To offload that software defined virtualization and the infrastructure operating system, if you will, and the security services to accelerate it because Moore's law has ended and moving software that was running on one CPU -- one set of CPUs, which is really, really good already to another set of CPUs is going to make it more effective, separating it doesn't make more effective. And so you want to offload that and take the -- take that application software and accelerated using accelerators, a form of accelerated computing. And so that's -- these things are fundamentally what BlueField is all about. And we created the processor that allows us to -- BlueField-2 replaces approximately 30 CPU cores. BlueField-3 replaces approximately 300 CPU cores, which just -- put it give you a sense of it. And BlueField-4, we're in the process of building already. And so, we've got a really aggressive pipeline to do this. Now, how big of this market, the way to think about that is every single networking chip in the world will be a smart network [indiscernible] -- it will check. It will be a programmable accelerated infrastructure processor. And that's what the DPU is, it's a data center on a chip. And I believe every single server node will have it. It will replace today's mix with something like BlueField, and it will offload about half of the software processing that's consuming data centers today. But most importantly, it will enable this future world where every single packet, every single application is being monitored in real time all the time for intrusion. And so, how big is that application? How big is that market? Just, 25 million servers a year. That's the size of the market. And we know that servers are growing, and so those give you a feeling for that. And then in the future servers are going to move out to the Edge. And all of those Edge devices will have something like BlueField. And then how are we doing? We're doing PLCs now with just about every internet company. We're doing really exciting work there. We've included it in high performance computing, so that it's possible for supercomputers in the future to be cloud-native, to be zero trust, to be secured and still be a supercomputer. And then we expect next year to have meaningful, if not significant revenues contribution from BlueField, and this is going to be a really large growth market for us. You can tell, I'm excited about this. And I put a lot of my energy into it. The company is working really hard on it. And this is a form of accelerated computing that's going to really make a difference.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, is NVIDIA able to ring fence this crypto impact in your CMP product? So even if, let's say crypto goes away, for whatever reason, the decline is a lot more predictable and manageable than what we saw in the 2018, '19 cycle. And then kind of part B of that is, how do you think about your core PC gamer demand? Because when we see these kind of 106% year-on-year growth rate, it brings questions of sustainability. So give us your perspectives on these two topics, just how does one ring fence kind of the crypto effect? And what do you think about the sustainability of your core PC gamer demand? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Sure. Thanks a lot. First of all, it's hard to estimate exactly how much and where crypto mining is being done. However, we can only assume that the vast majority of it is contributed by professional miners, especially when the amount of mining increases tremendously like in-house [ph]. And so we created the CMP. And CMP and GeForce are not fungible. You could use GeForce for mining, but you can't use CMP for gaming. CMP is yields better and producing those doesn't take away from the supply of GeForce. And so it protects our GeForce supply for the gamers. And the question that you have is what happens when on the tail end of this? There's several things that we hope. And we learned a lot from the last time, but you never learn enough about this dynamic. What we hope is that that the CMPs will satisfy the miners at work will stay in mines, in the professional mines. And we're trying to produce a fair amount of them and we have secured a lot of demand for the CMPs and we will fulfill it. And what makes it different this time is several things. One, we're in the beginning of our RTX cycle, whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And now exactly was at the tail end of the GTX cycle, because the last GTX and it was the tail end of GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we reinvented computer graphics, we reset the computer industry. And after 3 years, the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developers need to do ray tracing, every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing. And so if you lose ray tracing, these applications are so much better. And they simply run too slow on GTX's and so we're seeing a reset of the install base, if you will. And at a time when the gaming market is the largest ever, we've got this incredible install base of GeForce users. We've reinvented computer graphics and reset the install base and create an upgrade opportunity that's really exciting at a time when the market is the gaming market, the gaming industry is really large. And what's really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming. And it's infused into sports, e-sports. It's infused into art. It's infused into social. And so gaming is -- it has such a large cultural impact now, it's the largest form of entertainment. And I think that the experience we're going through is going to last a while. And so, one I hope that crypto will -- the CMP will steer our GeForce supply to gamers. We see strong demand and I expect to see strong demand for quite some time because of the dynamics that I described. And hopefully in the combination of those two, we'll see strong growth and through strong growth in our core gaming business through the year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Jensen, I had two hopefully quick questions. First, I hearken back to the monitor you guys put out at couple of analyst days ago, the more you spend, the more you save. And you've always been very successful as you brought down the cost of doing something to really drive penetration growth. And so I'm curious with the NVIDIA Enterprise AI software stack, is there a sense that you can give us is how much that brings down the cost of deployment and AI inside the Enterprise? And do you think whether COVID lockdown related or cost related, there's pent up demand that this unlocks? And then my second question is just around government subsidies. A lot of talks out of Washington about subsidizing the chip industry, a lot of that goes towards building fabs domestically. But when I look at AI, I can't think of anything more important to maintain sort of leadership in relative to national security. How do we think about NVIDIA and kind of the impact that these government subsidies might have on either you or your customers or your business trends?\nJensen Huang: The more you buy, the more you [indiscernible], there's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing, we don't accelerate every application. However, for the applications we do accelerate, the acceleration is so dramatic. And because we sell a component, the entire system, the TCO, the TCO of the entire system, and all the services and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost has been reduced by X factors, sometimes 10x, sometimes 15x, sometimes 5x. And so the -- so when we set our mind on accelerating a certain class of applications and recently we worked on true [ph] quantum so that we could help the quantum industry, quantum computing industry it's already there simulators so that they could discover new algorithms and invent future computers, even though it won't happen until 2030. For the next 20 years, that we're going to have 15 years, we're going to have some really, really great work that we can do, using NVIDIA GPUs to do quantum simulations. We recently did a lot of work in natural language understanding in computational biology so that we could decode biology and understand how biology is to infer to understand it and to predictively improve upon it and design new proteins. Those words are so vital. And that's what accelerated computing all about. Our Enterprise software, and I really appreciate the question. Our Enterprise software used to be just about the BGP, which is virtualizing GPU inside the VMware environment, or inside the Red Hat environment and makes it possible for multiple users to use one GPU, which is the nature of Enterprise virtualization, but now with NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA Fleet Command, whether you're doing collaboration or virtual simulations for robotics and digital twins, design your factory or you're doing data analytics, learning what the predictive features are that could create an AI model, predictive model that you can deploy out at the Edge using Fleet Command. We now have an intense suite of software that is consistent with today's enterprise service agreements. It's consistent with today's enterprise business models, and allows us to support customers directly, and provide them with the necessary service promises that they expect, because they're delivering -- they're trying to build a mission critical application on top. And, more importantly, by creating this -- prioritizing our software, we provide the ability for our large network of partners, OEM partners, value added resellers, system integrators, solution providers for this large network of hundreds of thousands of IT sales professionals that we are connected to through our network, we give them a product that they can take to market. And so the distribution channel, the sales channel, VMware, the sales channel of Cloudera, the sales channel of all of our partners [indiscernible] and design, Autodesk, [indiscernible] so on so forth, all of these sales channels and all of these partners are now partners and taking our stacks to market. And we have a fully integrated system that are open to the OEM, so that they could create systems of run the stack. And it's all certified, all tested, all benchmark and, of course, very importantly, all supported. And so this new way of taking our products to market, whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow, and that part of AI is going to continue to grow that business is direct. We sell components directly to them, we support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For Enterprises, there are thousands industries far and wide. And so I think this -- we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more.\nOperator: And your final question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. [Indiscernible] Colette. So Colette, last quarter you had kind of suggested that Q1 would be the trough for, I guess, for gaming as well as the rest of the company beginning in particular, and it would grow sequentially through the year. I guess given the strength we're seeing in the first half, do you still believe that that is the case? And I kind of heard you guys, I think kind of dance around that point a little bit in response to one of the other questions. But could you clarify that? Is that still your belief that that core gaming business can grow sequentially through the rest of the year? And I guess same question is for data center, especially since sounds like hyperscale is now coming back, like after a few quarters of digestion and then all of the other tailwinds you've talked about. I mean, is there any reason to think that data center itself shouldn't also grow sequentially, like through the rest of the year?\nColette Kress: Yes, Stacy, thanks for the question. So I first of all start with when we talked about our Q1 results. And when we're looking at Q1, we were really discussing a lot about what we expected between Q4 and Q1. Given what we knew was still high demand for gaming. We believed we would continue to grow between Q4 and Q1, which often we don't. And we absolutely have the strength and overall demand to grow. What that then lead was, again, continued growth from Q1 to Q2 as we are working hard to provide more supply for the strong demand that we say. We have talked about that we have additional supply coming. We expect to continue to grow as we move into the second half of the year as well for gaming. Now, we only guide one quarter at a time, but our plan is to take the supply, serve the overall gamers, work on building out the channel, as we know the channel is quite lean. And so yes, we do and still expect growth in the second half of the year, particularly when we see the lineup of games, the holiday overall coming, the back-to-school, all very important cycles for us. And there's a great opportunity to upgrade this, RTX install base. Now, in terms of data center, will work in terms of our guidance here. We have growth from Q1 to Q2 planned in our overall guidance. And we do see as things continue to open up a time to accelerate in the second half of the year for data center. We have, again a great lineup of products here. It couldn't be a better lineup now that we've also added the inferencing products and the host of overall applications that are using our software that we have. So this could be an opportunity as well to see that continued growth. We will work in terms of serving the supply that we need for both of these markets. But yes, we can see definitely growth in the second half of the year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. The CEO, Jensen Huang, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nJensen Huang: Well, thank you. Thank you for joining us today. NVIDIA computing platform is accelerating. Launched at GTC, we are now ramping new platforms and initiatives. There are several that I mentioned. First, enabled by the fusion of NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA [indiscernible]. We built Omniverse, a platform for virtual collaboration and virtual worlds to enable tens of millions of artists and designers to create together in their own metaverse. Second, we lay the foundation to be a three check data center scale computing company with GPUs, DPUs and CPUs. Third, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We partner with cloud and consumer internet companies to scale out and commercialize AI powered services. And we're democratizing AI for every enterprise and every industry. With NVIDIA AGX certified systems, the NVIDIA Enterprise AI Suite pre-train models for conversational AI, language understanding, recommender systems and our broad partnerships across the IT industry, we are removing the barriers for every enterprise to access state-of-the-art AI. Four, the work of NVIDIA Clara in using AI to revolutionize genomics and biology is deeply impactful for the health care industry, and I look forward to telling you a lot more about this in the future. And fifth, the electric self driving and software defined car is coming. With NVIDIA DRIVE, we are partnering with the global transportation industry to reinvent the car architecture, reinvent mobility, reinvent driving and reinvent the business model of the industry. Transportation is going to be one of the world's largest technology industries. From gaming, metaverses cloud computing, AI, robotics, self driving cars, genomics, computational biology, NVIDIA is doing important work and innovating in the fastest growing markets today. As you can see, on top of our computing platforms that span PC, HPC, Cloud, Enterprise to Autonomous Edge, we've also transformed our business model beyond chips. NVIDIA vGPU, NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Fleet Command and NVIDIA Omniverse adds enterprise software license and subscription to our business model. And NVIDIA GeForce Now and NVIDIA DRIVE with Mercedes Benz as the lead partner, our end-to-end services on top of that.  I want to thank all of the NVIDIA employees and partners for the amazing work you're doing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2024": [{"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 4, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-02-22 19:33:12", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference. \nSimona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website.  With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, while down 21% year-on-year. Full year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center. Revenue was $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew but a bit less than our expected on softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues.  With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue.  Adoption of our new flagship H100 data center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament of the exceptional performance on the H100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x faster than [inferencing of] (ph) transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale out of inference of large language models.  AI adoption is at an inflection point. Open AI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents like [indiscernible], creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster.  Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across the AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprise. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities.  In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year.  During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI.  Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale, generative AI.  For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum 2 40 gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40 gigabit per second Spectrum 4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adapters and switches.  We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained model and new workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription and cybersecurity. Upcoming offerings include our NeMo and BioNeMo large language model services, which are currently in early access with customers.  Now to Jensen to talk a bit more about our software and cloud business.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. The cumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI's versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies. Yet, the AI supercomputer infrastructure, model algorithms, data processing and training techniques remain an insurmountable obstacle for most. Today, I want to share with you the next level of our business model to help put AI within reach of every enterprise customer.  We are partnering with major service -- cloud service providers to offer NVIDIA AI cloud services, offered directly by NVIDIA and through our network of go-to-market partners, and hosted within the world's largest clouds. NVIDIA AI as a service offers enterprises easy access to the world's most advanced AI platform, while remaining close to the storage, networking, security and cloud services offered by the world's most advanced clouds.  Customers can engage NVIDIA AI cloud services at the AI supercomputer, acceleration library software or pretrained AI model layers. NVIDIA DGX is an AI supercomputer, and the blueprint of AI factories being built around the world. AI supercomputers are hard and time-consuming to build. Today, we are announcing the NVIDIA DGX Cloud, the fastest and easiest way to have your own DGX AI supercomputer, just open your browser. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is already available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Microsoft Azure, Google GCP and others on the way.  At the AI platform software layer, customers can access NVIDIA AI enterprise for training and deploying large language models or other AI workloads. And at the pretrained generative AI model layer, we will be offering NeMo and BioNeMo, customizable AI models, to enterprise customers who want to build proprietary generative AI models and services for their businesses. With our new business model, customers can engage NVIDIA's full scale of AI computing across their private to any public cloud. We will share more details about NVIDIA AI cloud services at our upcoming GTC so be sure to tune in.  Now let me turn it back to Colette on gaming.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market.  Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly shot up in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphics.  Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and apps.  In another first, we are bringing the 90 class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over [170] (ph) gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-schools season.  There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which massively boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3 enabling a 3 to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution.  Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions, users, titles and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from a cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3.  And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce NOW Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch.  Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year.  Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS.  Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% from [indiscernible] and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%.  At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume, manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global .  We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation.  Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to the higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses.  Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%.  We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately %7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24. We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our 4 major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of nonaffiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.  In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6 in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24.  Now we will open up the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model. I'm just curious, Colette, how do we start to think about that monetization contribution to the company's business model over the next couple of quarters relative to, I think, in the past, you've talked like a couple of hundred million or so? Just curious if you can unpack that a little bit.\nColette Kress: So I'll start and turn it over to Jensen to talk more because I believe this will be a great topic and discussion also at our GTC.  Our plans in terms of software, we continue to see growth even in our Q4 results, we're making quite good progress in both working with our partners, onboarding more partners and increasing our software. You are correct. We've talked about our software revenues being in the hundreds of millions. And we're getting even stronger each day as Q4 was probably a record level in terms of our software levels. But there's more to unpack in terms of there, and I'm going to turn it to Jensen.\nJensen Huang: Yes, first of all, taking a step back, NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere.  By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective. You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1?  And then Jensen, my main question kind of relate to 2 small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question. First, talking about our data center guidance that we provided for Q1. We do expect a sequential growth in terms of our data center, strong sequential growth. And we are also expecting a growth year-over-year for our data center. We actually expect a great year with our year-over-year growth in data center probably accelerating past Q1.\nJensen Huang: Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster.  What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, it's new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models.  And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. So that's one thought.  The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting.  The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models.  The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere.  The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or 2/3 of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50x faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end.  And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way. And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- anyhow those are the 2 answers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point kind of like the iPhone. And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises? And then secondly, as you think about Hopper with the transformative engine and Grace with high-bandwidth memory, how have you kind of your outlook for growth for those 2 product cycles evolved in the last few months?\nJensen Huang: ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability.  What people were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood. But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program.  We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed. This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly, or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not.  And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and they're, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide.  The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build Hopper and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen & Company.\nMatthew Ramsay: Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing and [indiscernible] InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next 2 or 3 years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time?\nJensen Huang: Yes, I appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our Data Center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of 8 Hoppers or 8 Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially 1 GPU. It's 8 chips connected together into 1 GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is 1 GPU.  So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud.  And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within 1 entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. And so this is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be?\nJensen Huang: I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened towards the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications part cloud, part on the mobile device and so easy to distribute because of app stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI.  In no computing era did 1 computing platform, ChatGPT, reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. And so I think this -- the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Rasgon: I have a clarification and then a question both for Colette. The clarification, you said H-100 revenue's higher than A100. Was that an overall statement? Or was that at the same point in time like after 2 quarters of shipments?  And then for my actual question. I wanted to ask about auto, specifically the Mercedes opportunity. The Mercedes had an event today, and they were talking about software revenues for their MB Drive that could be single digit or low billion euros by mid-decade and mid billion euros by the end of the decade. And I know you guys were supposedly splitting the software revenues 50-50. Is that kind of the order of magnitude of software revenues from the Mercedes deal that you guys are thinking of and over that similar time frame? Is that how we should be modeling that?\nColette Kress: Great. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let me first start with your question you had about H-100 and A100. We began initial shipments of H-100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. And this was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H-100 that we saw. What that means is our H-100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they were all wanting to get both get up and running in cloud instances. And so we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H-100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for  Your additional questions that you had on Mercedes Benz. I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently about getting ready to come to market. And you're right. They did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in 2 phases, about what they can do with Drive as well as what they can also do with Connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. So it aligns with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that and sharing that revenue over time.\nJensen Huang: One of the things that, if I could add, Stacy, to say something about the wisdom of what Mercedes is doing. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. If you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedeses that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. And that's the vision that Ola has. And what they're building for, I think, it's going to be extraordinary. The large installed base of luxury cars that will continue to renew with -- for customers' benefits and also for revenue-generating benefits.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.\nMark Lipacis: I think for you, Jensen, it seems like every year a new workload comes out and drives demand for your process or your ecosystem cycles. And if I think back facial recognition and then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse and now generative AI engines, can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand-new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products?  And the reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services is -- seems to be a lot, better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. So -- and to the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today?\nJensen Huang: Yes, Mark, I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. And so that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about.  Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly, highly paralyzed to offload them. But we're multi-domain. We could do particle systems. We could do fluids. We could do neurons. And we can do computer graphics. We can do . There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one.  Number two, our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform. Literally, the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration, number one. They like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it and the fact that they have so many people they can reach out to, to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. And then very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see -- they can reach so many users after they develop the software. And it is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications.  And then finally, this is a very important point. Remember, the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. And whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, at 10x in performance at about the same power every 5 years and then 10x every 5 years. That rate of continued advance has slowed. At a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world, and they can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable. You can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. And so all of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Colette, I have a question on data center. You saw some weakness on build plan in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-over-year acceleration in April and through the year. So if you can just rank order for us the confidence in the acceleration. Is that based on your H-100 ramp or generative AI sales coming through or the new AI services model? And also, if you can talk about what you're seeing on the enterprise vertical.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect year-over-year growth in Q1 as well. It will likely accelerate there going forward. So what do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H-100 in market now. We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking. And then we have grades coming likely in the second half of the year. Additionally, generative AI, it's sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, one of those be start-ups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year. And then lastly, let's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an error here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated continuing. So as the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they [indiscernible]. I'm going to turn it to Jensen to see if has any additional things he'd like to add.\nJensen Huang: No, you did great. That was great.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Jensen, you talked about the sort of 1 million times improvement in your ability to train these models over the last decade. Can you give us some insight into what that looks like in the next few years and to the extent that some of your customers with these large language models are talking about 100x the complexity over that kind of time frame. I know Hopper is 6x better transformer performance. But what can you do to scale that up? And how much of that just reflects that it's going to be a much larger hardware expense down the road?\nJensen Huang: First, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. And the reason for that is AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufacture just physical goods. In the future, there will be -- almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in. That data center does exactly 1 thing and 1 thing only. It cranks on that data and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or an infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called the factory. And so I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud. Some of it will be on-prem. There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller. And so I fully expect that to happen, number one.  Number two. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x. There's a lot of ways for us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack all the way from the chip, all the way into the data center across the network through the software. And in the mind of 1 single company, we can think across that entire stack. And it's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason because we can innovate across that entire stack. So my expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. The accumulation of breakthroughs from transformers, large language model and generative AI has elevated the capability and versatility of AI to a remarkable level. A new computing platform has emerged. New companies, new applications and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses. The level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working towards for over a decade. And we are ready. Our Hopper AI supercomputer with the new transformer engine and Quantum InfiniBand fabric is in full production, and CSPs are racing to open their Hopper cloud services. As we work to meet the strong demand for our GPUs, we look forward to accelerating growth through the year.  Don't miss the upcoming GTC. We have much to tell you about new chips, systems and software, new CUDA applications and customers, new ecosystem partners and a lot more on NVIDIA AI and Omniverse. This will be our best GTC yet. See you there.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's third quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year on year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue. while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions. Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S. cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics. During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter. We started shipping our flagship 100 data center GPU based on the new hopper architecture in Q3. A100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and SuperMicro. Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers three x lower total cost of ownership while using five x fewer server nodes and 3.5 x less energy. Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models. MacBook Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and A100 GPUs. Quantum 2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform. Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure, the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100. Cloud-based high-performance in the company, new scale is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities, rising demand for AI in the cloud. NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. -- our new Quantum 240 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware. And whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs. Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure softer partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, [Inaudible] Networks and Red Hot. The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 and has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing. The No. 1 most energy-efficient system is the Flat Iron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVS, reference designs featuring the new L4 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual world using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise. NVIDIA OBX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro by early 2023. We Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVS systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and Bio Nemo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions. Moving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4. Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA and but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and covered lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the ATA family, RTX 4080 is available today. The RTX 40 Series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neuro rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and help supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year old classic game portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed gains. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350. There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on steam just hit a record of $30 million, surpassing the prior peak of $28 million in January. Activision's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales. topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, TopGun Maverick and Dr. Strains in the Multiverse of [Inaudible]. And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out minutes with 18,000 esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce now on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razor 5G Edge. Moving to Probi Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OBX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer, Lowe's is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, heavy AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. In Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive. Revenue of $251 million, increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers drive or on-based production ramp, continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Global cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform. This is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both drive Orin and DRIVEXaviar, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include ton, auto, Neo, Polystar and [Inaudible]. At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA Drive Super Chip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC road map, drive [Inaudible] delivers up to 2,000 tariff lots of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and ADA architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems. Simultaneously offering a LIFA performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. Driver will be available for automakers 25 models with Geely owned automaker, Zika as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%. Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the A100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. And in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Oren design wins. All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30. The rate Virtual Tech Conference on December 5 and and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. And then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?\nColette Kress: Yes. Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. we had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 three was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business. It was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid. And desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Vivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows. The second dynamic is AI. And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs in important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a selfie or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them. The second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to Bert, which led to GP3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language. It could be the language of biology. It could be the language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, we just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes. The third has to do with generative AI. You know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product. And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI. You probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever. And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for niche reasons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah, Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. You started to bundle on NVIDIA enterprise now with the H-100. I'm curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software monetization? And how we should kind of see this flow through the model, particularly with the focus on the AI enterprise and Omnivere side of things?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Thanks, CJ. We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds. You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and start-ups of all kinds, but more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there. It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their start-ups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so, today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise. That's all software included. We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that rescale a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. [Inaudible] has been integrated into GCP. And we announced recently Nemo, large language model and bionemo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack off boarding the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud, it's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license. And so, license and subscription. And so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. The partners that we work with are super excited about it because MBDA's rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so, our software stack is making really great progress.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general. In the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations. And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges. And then, in general, for your internal inventory. Does that still need to be worked down? And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question, Chris. So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down. Now, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market. our ADA architecture, our hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward. But I think we've done a solid job that we used in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Colette, can you -- I have a two-part question. First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it. And I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to?\nColette Kress: Sure. So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They're usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no. Nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand. So that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not leg for write-downs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues. You said gaming resumed sequential growth. But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto gaming and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish? Are they all just like growing just a little bit? Or is one of them actually down? Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?\nColette Kress: Yes. So your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, is only growing about $100 million. And we've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit. But our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels. to get to the right amount. It's very difficult to say which will have that increase. But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, I think for you, you've articulated a vision for the data center we're a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think. Could you just give us a sense of or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle? And maybe talk about Grace Grace's importance for realizing that vision, what will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86 where -- do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Grace's data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10. That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace. And so, it was designed. Grace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It's all hot. It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using our service. It is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. And so, those kind of applications are really terrific. We -- Grace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years. Near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong Nick and blue food attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware, but we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. So what's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. If I could take that. First, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing. We're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications. It is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center. So the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings slightly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. And so, these days, with disaggregated and I application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world. And it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important. It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking. It is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the question. I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meda is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying. Jen-Hsun, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching? And maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking?\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Thanks, Erin. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%. The numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized. And so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very to achieve. The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge at the -- within the network itself. We achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so, if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars of interest on the infrastructure. The difference is really quite profound.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. I actually had a couple of clarifications. Colette, in the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out. And again, you said it grew quarter over quarter. So is that a fair assumption? And then, I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800 -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand it. Isn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute? Or is A800 going to a different set of customers?\nColette Kress: Thank you for the question. So looking at our compute for the quarter is about flattish. Yes, we're seeing also growth growth in terms of our networking, but you should look at our Q3 compute is about flatters with last quarter.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Ambrish, A800 hardware, the hardware of ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear test for export control. And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited. It is in the hardware that determines 800s capabilities. And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute. The introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time. The company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected. But A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear tests for export control.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you. I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of 100 growth as we progress over the next year. We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there's supply available as well. So does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective? Or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of '23.\nJen-Hsun Huang: H-100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now Power Limited. And because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for hopper because of these new models that are that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models. Customers are clamoring to ramp hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, I is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years. it's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. And so, we're working hand with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up hoppers. We expect them to have hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so, we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1. That's a faster transition than MPIR. And so, it's because of the dynamics that I described.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business. And I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision? And I guess the derivative of that, Jen-Hsun, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently. I mean, what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently? Or is something changing about the mix of I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base.\nColette Kress: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies. But the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing. So we're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Yes. Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that's happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot. Internet service companies. And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing. Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer. They are also a cell with partner on the public cloud side of their business. Because of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack. The public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the cell with relationship they have with us. And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. And so, because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large. And so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will -- will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to looking backward at the crypto impact. Obviously, that's gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward? And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road?\nJen-Hsun Huang: We don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, it was up are until 4090 today. That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price. And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never zero. and when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market. But my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And and early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing that the ADA launch was a home run. That we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world. And so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market. So we're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch. We have many more ad products to come.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nToshiya Hari: Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks. I think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. And then, when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. And then, secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million. It's becoming a bigger piece of your opex. So curious how we should be modeling that going forward.\nColette Kress: Sure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter. and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers that are -- now that's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints, issues when setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult. And therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced. So it's difficult to determine, but stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\nJen-Hsun Huang: Thanks, everyone. We are quickly adapting to the macro environment. Correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our opex flat for the next few quarters. Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth. MRTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of [Inaudible] is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4090 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI. NVIDIA networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results. Oren is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services. we this pioneering work and accelerated computing is more vital than ever. Limited by business, general purpose commuting has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing. Scaling through general purchase computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\nOperator: [Operator signoff]"}, {"symbol": "NVDA", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2022-08-24 21:22:07", "content": "Operator: Good afternoon.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year-on-year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue. Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China. The decline in Gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated, driven by both lower units and lower ASPs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand. We implemented programs with our Gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel and to price position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch. As noted last quarter, we had expected cryptocurrency mining to make a diminishing contribution to gaming demand. We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong. NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam. Gaming has emerged from the pandemic an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity. Estimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce NOW registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350. Moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed and OEMs worked to reduce inventory. We expect these trends to persist in Q3. While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads. We believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office as well as in the cloud. In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial levers and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens Xcelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse. This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA to Siemens ecosystem of the world\u2019s largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the Internet. First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries. We also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112. And finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neural graphics, which intertwine AI and graphics to help automate the creation of virtual world. Moving to Automotive. Revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year-ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpit and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume. We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our automotive revenue as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum. During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners, NIO, Li Auto, JIDU and Human Horizons as well as Pony.ai\u2019s line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE. Looking forward, we expect our $11 billion automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth. Moving to Data Center. Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year-on-year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions. Vertical industries grew both, sequentially and year-on-year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet, data processing and training and cloud graphics. Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100x larger recommender models by moving its inference from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs. Its ability to deploy a higher-quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images. And Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training. From a product perspective, networking led growth this quarter with strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adopters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400 gigabit per second Ethernet networking platform. Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPU. Top computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo and Supermicro are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supers. 72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA\u2019s [Indiscernible] Selene supercomputer ranks at number 8 in the top 500 and is the world\u2019s fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA. Significant advances in software technologies are key to our platform performance. In the past two years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6x more performance as measured by the MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations. Last month, we announced an update to the NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%, improving a multi-hundred million dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers. LLM are one of the most important neural networks today, ranging in size from tens of billions to over 1 trillion parameters. Learning from text, they can be used for real-time content generation, tech summarization, customer service chat box and question answering for conversational AI interfaces. Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA DGX Foundry as well as in Microsoft Azure cloud with other platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during the time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty. We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs, as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment, and engineering development of new products coming to market. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth while managing near-term profitability. Our full year non-GAAP OpEx is expected to grow over 30%. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases. We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal \u201823. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in data center and automotive. Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Jefferies Conference in Chicago on August 30th and the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on September 12th. And we will be holding a financial analyst Q&A with management following Jensen\u2019s GTC keynote on September 20th. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 16th. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist? Would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: I think the question we all have is what is normalized revenues for gaming for you guys? Obviously, this is a challenge to you as well. But curious how you\u2019re thinking about it today. Is the fiscal \u201820 recovery post the first half \u201819 correction an appropriate framework, or was that inflated by crypto as well? And I guess, as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? And is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if gaming does not meet your new updated outlook? Thanks so much.\nColette Kress: Well, let me start first there and see if I can assist in terms of how to think about after we get through our completion just now of Q2 and what we have provided here for guidance for Q3. Across those two quarters, the Q2 of \u201823, the Q3 of \u201823, we have likely undershipped gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion. Now, on top of this, keep in mind that we do have gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new gaming product introductions that are around the corner as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology to just name a couple. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that. Now, regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we need for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products. And so, this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So, our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Colette. C.J., our sell-through is off the highs in the beginning of the year, but it\u2019s still very solid. In fact, sell-through is -- has increased 70% since pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And so, it\u2019s very clear that gaming is -- the fundamentals of gaming are strong, and this medium is really doing well. Not to mention the gaming platforms are being used -- our gaming PCs are being used for influencers, people sharing content, creating content, V bloggers, VTuber, there\u2019s all kinds of new ways of engaging and spending time with video games. Our strategy is to reduce the sell-in -- reduce the sell-in this quarter, next quarter to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we\u2019re off the highs, and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so, our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We\u2019ve also instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we\u2019ve ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it\u2019s going to be layered on top of that. And so, we\u2019ve taken -- we\u2019ve done two things. We\u2019ve reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct and we\u2019ve implemented programs with our partners to price position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation. All of this we anticipate were working towards a path to being in a good shape going into next year. Okay? So, that\u2019s what our game plan is.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.\nVivek Arya: Actually, I just wanted to clarify, Jensen. So, should we assume that a gaming sell-in will kind of stay at these levels into your Q1 or Q2, or depending on new product launch, it might recover? So just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there. And then, my question is actually similar on the data center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that data center CapEx could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your sense of utilization of your data center shipments? And what is the risk that there could be a correction in the data center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers?\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through -- the sell-through, as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end market gaming demand is solid. It\u2019s off the highs, which was really high recently in the beginning of the year. And so, we have -- and because we were building for such a vibrant market, we found ourselves with excess inventory. And so, our strategy is to sell well below -- sell in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct. We\u2019ll do that for a couple of quarters or so. We believe that by the end of the year, we\u2019ll be in a good shape going into next year. And so, I hope that answers your question. But, the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID. And so, the gaming market is really quite vibrant. On the second question, on data center end markets, we hear fairly broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud. We hear quite broadly that demand for GPU rentals far exceeds current supply. And it\u2019s fairly sensible to us, partly because the number of use cases for GPUs in the cloud has grown quite a bit. If you look at one particular segment in just managing -- collecting data and managing the data of the AV fleet and using that data to train AI models, using that data to reconstruct HD maps, the usage of GPUs in the cloud for just that one application has grown a lot. And furthermore, there\u2019s the deep learning-based recommender systems has demonstrated such significant effectiveness. And it helps internet service providers to enhance engagement, enhance click-through rate. And so that -- so this particular form of recommender systems is going to really drive a fair amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud. And then, of course, over the last several years, a very important model has emerged called transformers. You and I\u2019ve spoken about this model several times in the past. And it\u2019s been found that this transformer model, this large language -- this language model, which when scaled up in size, exhibits really spectacular and effective capabilities for -- to be used to learn skills with either few shots or almost no shot, meaning it could learn skills, it could perform skills that it has never learned because the knowledge was somehow encoded from the large amount of data that it had learned from. And so, this large language model area of innovation is used in, of course, conversational chat, Q&A summarization, text generation, image generation. But very importantly, it\u2019s being used in life sciences for understanding chemistry. We\u2019ve done some very important work in this area ourselves called MegaMolBART, understanding proteins, understanding DNA to learn the language of these large -- very, very large, spatially as well as temporally or sequentially types of data. And so, the impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It\u2019s called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it the Foundation models that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs. And so, we\u2019re seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud. We were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because as you know, we don\u2019t just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer like HGX. And so kitting -- all of the components that have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component. And then furthermore, these data centers sit idle until the last piece comes together. And the last piece includes very complicated switches and very complicated NICs and networkings and cables. And so these -- building these high-performance computing data centers at very large scale for the world\u2019s cloud is not particularly easy. And so the supply chain challenges have been somewhat disruptive. But the demand is there. And on top of that, we\u2019re ramping into Hopper, which is really a fantastic generation.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: I wanted to follow up on the data center question that Vivek just asked from a couple of angles. I guess, Colette, the first angle being, in the release, you guys talked about pulling high $200 million of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October. So if you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up data center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins. And Jensen, the second part, the moving pieces, networking stronger in data center, U.S. hyperscale stronger, China hyperscale weaker. If you could kind of walk us through the trends that you\u2019re seeing into the October and January quarters. And in those sort of those breakouts and when clarify for us when you think H-100 will really start to drive revenue.\nColette Kress: Great. Thanks for the question. And it\u2019s kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we\u2019re seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through. Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It\u2019s not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers orders components themselves, they\u2019re looking from us what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers. We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time from a logistics and availability to get those things out. Customers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we weren\u2019t offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn\u2019t be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2. So we worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve disclosed to you.\nJensen Huang: Let me answer the questions about the North American and the China hyperscalers. The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they\u2019ve been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well really slowed down in Q2. This slowdown can\u2019t last forever. And the number of new technologies in software, the number of people who are using clouds and the number of cloud services is continuing to grow. And so I fully expect investment to return. They\u2019re a very important market for us, a very large market for us. And the fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year-over-year our revenues at North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China said something about the slowdown in China. And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to last forever. I think it\u2019s going to return. With respect to Hopper, we\u2019re in full production now. And we\u2019re racing to get Hopper 2, all of the CSPs are dying to get them. And it goes with our HGX, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray, it\u2019s really a supercomputer in a motherboard, if you will. And it goes along with it networking gear and switch gear. And so there\u2019s the enormous amounts of resources apply from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper. We expect to ship substantial Hoppers in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had a question regarding the $1.22 billion inventory charge, maybe for Colette, on this one specifically. In the CFO commentary, I think you stated that the inventory charge is related to weaker demand in both data center and gaming. I think the gaming side is pretty clear based on your comments so far. Curious what\u2019s changed on the data center side? Is it mostly the Chinese hyperscalers that Jensen just spoke to? Or is there something else going on in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about demand in data center over the next couple of quarters? And related to this, curious if the delay in Sapphire Rapids at Intel is having an impact on your business in the near to medium term?\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question. So our inventory charges, as we commented, we\u2019re taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter as well as the quarter that we\u2019re guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have. And so what is happening here for the data center, we had great, high expectations. We still have very strong, solid growth projection for data center as well. We\u2019re going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces to write down those given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward. So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for gaming. We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions and you get ready for our future product launches take into account, but there\u2019s also components, services and capacity in some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs.\nJensen Huang: Our Hopper supports previous generation CPUs. But I guess, next-generation GPUs, CPUs, Sapphire Rapids and Genoa after that as well as Graviton. And so -- so we certify and test across all of the CPUs because the cloud service providers demand it. And they intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators, NVIDIA Hoppers across a large number of CPUs. There is no question that the delay is disruptive and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next-generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old generation, current generation CPUs as well. And so nobody likes the delay. The next-generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers. And so I\u2019m super excited about them. However, we\u2019re going to be able to go to market plentifying with Hopper supporting existing infrastructure.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And a lot of it\u2019s kind of been talked a little bit about, but I just -- Colette, I want to think about the numbers a little bit more. I guess, based on the guidance commentary, where I\u2019ve come up thinking about would be like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in gaming and Professional Visualization and maybe kind of low to mid-single-digit growth in Data Center and Auto. So I guess, is that the right context? And with that and with Hopper coming down the pipeline, we\u2019re going to have a lot of questions around kind of the deceleration of year-over-year growth in Data Center, I believe. Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes?\nColette Kress: Yes. Thanks for the question. And that\u2019s a pretty good understanding of our guidance. And we do expect, yes, gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2. So that may be of our 2 areas of the decline, our gaming and ProViz, that may be about 3/4 of it associated with that gaming. And then Professional Visualization would probably be about 1/4 of the 2 areas that will decline. Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We\u2019ll continue to look at it. There may be some more opportunity there. And automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter, we are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point. So we\u2019ll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4 and expectations.\nJensen Huang: The first thing I\u2019d say, Aaron, is that we are selling in or we\u2019re selling far below the market demand, far -- excuse me, far below the market sell-through. And the reason for that is to allow the inventory the channel inventory, the OEM inventories to correct. And this allows us to prepare for our next generation. And our next generation has Hopper for compute, but we also have the next generation for computer graphics that will be coming to market. Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers. It has an engine inside it called Transformer engine with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer-type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers. And so I fully expect Hopper 2 to be the next springboard for future growth. And -- and the importance of this new model, Transformer, can\u2019t possibly be understated and can\u2019t be overstated. This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design is just really quite spectacular. And I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve been hearing about this new breakthrough in AI, and Hopper was designed for this.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Colette, can you talk about networking versus compute? Were they both supply constrained in the July quarter? And are they both sequentially growing in the October quarter?\nColette Kress: So within our Q2 results, we have been continuing to improve our supply for networking. We have a lot of important products that the CSP needs, many of our customers\u2019 needs, and we have been working to really improve that supply. And we were able to set very strong growth in terms of networking, both sequentially and year-over-year. And as we move into the next quarter, we\u2019re going to have to see which is going to be growth larger. We\u2019re just going to have to take a lot once we finish that quarter. But our supply for compute is here. But as we\u2019ve discussed, sometimes it\u2019s important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs. So sometimes those are very important for us to deliver together. So we always have to keep that in mind. So it\u2019s not always supply constrained, but there are certain parts of it that are.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great. I wanted to ask why did the supply constraints hit you guys so hard this quarter? I mean you\u2019ve done such a great job in the last couple of years outgrowing really everybody in a very challenging supply chain environment. It hasn\u2019t tripped you up at all. And it seems like now it\u2019s kind of hitting you fairly hard at a time when, in other cases, it\u2019s kind of easing. So I\u2019m just kind of curious, what is it about the timing and how long does it sort of take? Or is that a Hopper issue? Is it related to other components? As you talked about, how long does it take to clear those issues up?\nColette Kress: Let me start and see if Jensen wants to add on to it. Our execution has absolutely been phenomenal. When you think about the challenges of we\u2019re almost putting together a full data center for our customers and getting it shipped out. So we\u2019re no different in the same way that the CSPs are challenging. We\u2019re setting up their data centers as we\u2019re such an integral part of that. And so networking has been short of supply. These are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having. So our supply arrived a little bit late in the quarter for some of our key products that we needed to get out. And putting that together caused some disruption in our logistics and distribution. We were pleased in terms of reaching the leverage of networking that we did, but we did have some challenges this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Rasgon: I wanted to go back to that data center inventory charge. You listed data center first when you talked primarily related to data center and gaming. Can you give us a feeling for how much of that charge was data center versus gaming? And then to follow up on that, it did sound like to me that it was mostly Ampere and not Hopper change in expectations. Can you verify that or clarify it? And just talk about what\u2019s happened with your expectations for Hopper? Have they gone up or down? Or has there been any change at all relevant to that inventory charge?\nColette Kress: Yes, Stacy. Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, whether it be memory. Remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the 2. Additionally, the value of our inventory for data center is much different than the value of what we have for gaming from an overall cost perspective. So we\u2019re creating capacity opportunity, putting together all of those systems in terms of data center. It is prior architectures. Absolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provision has to do with that. So we took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions, as we\u2019ve discussed. Our expectations, our plans were higher. They\u2019re still quite solid that we see in demand both for gaming as well as solid for data center, and that will continue. But we did have to just take a rightsizing of that note.\nJensen Huang: Hopper was designed for transformers. The new transformers was going to be important. Nobody could have predicted the profound importance of large language models. Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, start-ups, industries, all exceeding everyone\u2019s expectations. I don\u2019t think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes. There\u2019s a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were smallish in the old days, in the beginning several years ago, 3 years ago. And the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving towards probably several trillion parameters, the effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular. And to have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within 1 shot or 1 shot of trying or even no shots, are able to perform that skill is beyond anybody\u2019s expectations, I would think. And so I think the -- the success of Hopper is -- reflects the amount of work and pent-up demand for large training systems that Hopper is going to go into. If that\u2019s an indicator, I think Hopper is going to be a spectacular success.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko.\nSrini Pajjuri: I have a question on gross margins, Colette. The 65% non-GAAP number you\u2019re guiding to, does that include or assume any additional write-offs on the inventory front? And then just to expand on that, your mix is probably a tailwind to gross margins given that gaming is down significantly and data center is up a little bit. And I\u2019m just wondering, are there any other offsets? Because I would have thought gross margins could actually be better than your longer-term model because of the mixed tailwinds?\nColette Kress: Yes. Thanks for the question. So our gross margins outside of the inventory charges in Q2 as well as going into Q3 is really about our sales mix that we have and probably also to understand that our sales mix in the next quarter for GPUs is not in the high end. And so that has impacted our gross margin as we move into Q3. You are correct. We do expect that data center will assist in our gross margins but we also have growth plans in auto. Auto is below our company average, and so that will tend to offset some of those upper bound things that we will see in terms of data center. From time to time, there\u2019s always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates. So nothing material is planned. But there is small scraps that may occur from quarter-to-quarter that are included in our gross margins.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTim Arcuri: Colette, I had a clarification and then a question. So my clarification is whether October gross margins are benefiting at all from the sale of previously written down inventory. And then my question is whether you can give us the enterprise cloud split in data center because it sounds like the mix shifted more towards enterprise in July. And I think investors might want to see that as risky in the face of enterprise clearly slowing. So I\u2019m wondering if you can give us that.\nColette Kress: Okay. No. No, there is nothing in our Q3 regarding those inventory provisions that we took in terms of earning that back, in terms of our Q3. Regarding our split between our hyperscalers and data centers and what we refer to as our vertical industries. They always tend to be about the same, 50% for one, 50% for the others. They\u2019re still in about that range. We had discussed that our China hyperscales did not drive growth in terms of sequentially here. And so that did influence in terms of the hyperscales, but still we are approximately in that 50%, 50%.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.\nHarlan Sur: On the weakness in ProViz, this is an enterprise-focused business, right? Granted, it\u2019s a somewhat narrow vertical market, but it does sort of play into the market concerns that consumer is weak now, enterprise is the next shoe to drop. So is the decline in ProViz attributed to enterprise spending weakness? Or is there some other dynamic? And why or why not is this not a leading indicator for your enterprise and vertical industry segments within your data center business?\nColette Kress: So our Pro Visualization business, just in such a short time, they were in short supply and really trying to feed so much of the industry\u2019s desire to both refresh and attracted to the new RTX workstations that were there. We were fueling both mobile as well as desktop for that market and growing quite nicely. Remember, all of last year, doubled the size of ProViz in 1 year. So right now, the OEMs are concentrating on their levels of inventory. We want to make sure that they can get through that inventory. But it -- keep in mind, very similar to our discussion on gaming, there is still solid demand. There is still solid demand. We just have to correct some of the inventory, but we still see both the opportunities that we\u2019ve created for the market for these to be long-standing. And your second question, remind me again?\nJensen Huang: Whether the broader enterprise market is -- the verticals are going to be affected by that? I would say, first of all, we don\u2019t know. Second of all, unlike like our Workstation business, our ProViz business, there\u2019s no installed base. Most of the ProViz sales tend to be tend to be upgrades or replacements from something that has -- our installed base of 3 or 4 or 5 years that people -- whatever upgrade cycle they happen to have. And so in the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying are ProViz, our ProViz systems likely already have systems that they\u2019ve been using. And so if they were to tighten up ProViz for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have. In the case of our AI business, there\u2019s no real installed base. These are all brand-new things that people are growing into. And the productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. And it\u2019s not so much that the demand isn\u2019t out there. Everybody would like to be more productive. Everybody would like to save more money. Everybody would like to move faster. It\u2019s just that AI understanding and AI\u2019s use is still spreading. And so we\u2019re delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our Viz business have very different characteristics for that reason. But what Colette said earlier is about our ProViz businesses last quarter is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory.\nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Let me ask a question. I just had a longer-term question about once your gaming business normalizes, with the absence of crypto in a general sense and with the merge coming, et cetera, how do you view the pricing environment? I know you guys really weren\u2019t raising prices like we saw in the MSR key premiums in the aftermarket. But generally, your mix was quite rich over the last year or 2. You\u2019re going to have lovely coming in that will obviously help the mix sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. But how do you think about it normalizing? Is that $2.5 billion per quarter sell-through rate comes, is the ASP mix across your stack about the same? Or does it go down because of the absence of that crypto tightening dynamic?\nJensen Huang: I would say that without crypto dynamic, the mix would go down. However, the overall trend long term, the ASP is drifting up. And the way to think about that is a game console, when -- my first game console was $99. Lately, game consoles are selling for about $599. And the reason for that is because it\u2019s more useful than ever. You use your gaming console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time. And GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. And we\u2019ve always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift towards the average selling price of a game console. And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time. We also have GeForce in the cloud. And because GeForce in the cloud is hosting many gamers simultaneously, it tends to want to be a much more powerful GeForce. And so our cloud gaming GeForce tends to be -- our cloud gaming graphics tends to be a much higher end. And so -- and then, of course, there\u2019s the design aspect of it. Most designers and most creators are able to use GeForce these days. And they use their PC to create content, and much of that content goes into video games and/or they\u2019re using video games to create their artistic content. And so the GeForce is not just for gaming for them. The GeForce is essentially their creative work station as well. And so there are several dynamics that are causing the ASP of GeForce to go up, and we\u2019ve been seeing this trend for several years now.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, everyone. We\u2019re navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment. In Gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We\u2019ll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month. In Data Center, AI where computers are helping us write software that was impossible before is driving a computing revolution and transforming every industry. NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in full stack data center scale, accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our data center products have never been stronger. The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the Internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world. This next evolution of the Internet is called metaverse. We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world and be an open platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start. Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next $1 billion business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry. Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry that all industries will be. We\u2019re building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world\u2019s enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies. I look forward to next month\u2019s GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming. AI\u2019s continuing breakthroughs and building the metaverse, the next evolution of the internet. So join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We delivered a strong quarter driven by record revenue in both Data Center and Gaming with strong fundamentals and execution against a challenging macro backdrop. Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. Data Center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year-on-year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years according to Newzoo. And NVIDIA RTX has set new standard for the industry with demand from both first-time GPU buyers as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, double from last year. We estimate that almost a-third of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world, and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid though mixed by region, and demand in Americas remained strong. However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in the Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2. Channel inventory has nearly normalized and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent in which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision. The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year. Driving this growth are not just gamers, but also the fast-growing category of content creators for whom we offer dedicated NVIDIA studio drivers. We've also developed applications and tools to empower artists from Omniverse for advanced 3D and collaboration to broadcast for live streaming to Canvas for painting landscapes with AI. The creator economy is estimated at $100 billion and powered by 80 million individual creators and broadcasters. We continued to build out our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Gamers can now access RTX 3080 class streaming, our new top-tier offering with subscription plans of $19.99 a month. We added over 100 games to the GeForce NOW library, bringing the total to over 1,300 games. And last week, we launched Fortnite on GeForce NOW with touch controls for mobile devices, streaming through the Safari web browser on iOS and the GeForce NOW Android app. Moving to Pro Visualization. Q1 revenue was $622 million was down sequentially 3% and up 67% from a year ago. Demand remains strong as enterprises continued to build out their employee's remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work. Sequential growth in the mobile workstation GPUs was offset by lower desktop revenue. Strong year-on-year growth was supported by the NVIDIA RTX Ampere architecture product cycle. Top use cases include digital content creation at customers such as Sony Pictures Animation and medical imaging at customers such as Medtronic. In just its second quarter of general availability, our Omniverse enterprise software is being adopted by some of the world's largest companies. Amazon is using Omniverse to create digital twins to better optimize warehouse design and flow and to train more intelligent robots. Kroger is using Omniverse to optimize store efficiency with digital twin store simulation. And PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the supply chain. Omniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand with third-party developers in the robotics, industrial automation, 3D design and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse. Moving to automotive. Q1 revenue of $138 million, increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year ago quarter. Our DRIVE Orin SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. Orin has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers and robotaxi companies. In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker and Lucid an award winning EV pioneer were the latest to announce that they are building their next-generation fleets on DRIVE Orin. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $11 billion over the next six years, up from $8 billion just a year ago. Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $3.8 billion grew 15% sequentially and accelerated to 83% growth year-on-year. Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year-on-year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads. Customers remain supply constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand. Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include consumer Internet companies, financial services and telecom. Overall, Data Center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries. Top workloads includes recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models and cloud graphics. Networking revenue accelerated on strong broad-based demand for our next-generation 25, 50 and 100-gig ethernet adapters. Customers are choosing NVIDIA's networking products for their leading performance and robust software functionality. In addition, networking revenue is benefiting from growing demand for DGX super pods and cross-selling opportunities. Customers are increasingly combining our compute and networking products to build what are essentially modern AI factories with data as the raw material input and intelligence as the output. Our networking products are still supply constrained though we expect continued improvement throughout the rest of the year. One of the biggest workloads driving adoption of NVIDIA AI is natural language processing, which has been revolutionized by transformer based models. Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include; large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron BERT for drug discovery and DeepMind AlphaFold for a protein structure prediction. Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for TAF such as text generation, translation, summarization and answering questions. To do that, Transformers use enormous training data sets and very large networks well into the hundreds of billions of parameters. To run these giant models without sacrificing low inference times, customers like Microsoft are increasingly deploying NVIDIA AI, including our NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and full software stack. In addition, we are seeing a rising wave of customer innovation using large language models that is driven by increased demand for NVIDIA AI and GPU instances in the cloud. At GTC, we announced our next-generation Data Center GPU, the H100 based on the new or upper architecture. Packed with 80 billion transistors, H100 is the world's largest, most powerful accelerator, offering an order of magnitude leap in performance over the A100. We believe H100 is hitting the market at the perfect time. H100 is ideal for advancing large language models and deep recommender systems the two largest scale AI workloads today We are working with leading server makers and hyperscale customers to qualify and ramp H100. As well as the new DGX H100 AI supercomputing system will ramp in volume late in the calendar year. Building on the H100 product side, we are on track to launch our first ever Data Center CPU, Grace, in the first half of 2023. Grace is the ideal CPU for AI factories. This week at COMPUTEX, we announced that dozens of server models based on Grace will be brought to market by the first wave of system builders, including ASUS, Foxconn, Gigabyte, QCT, Supermicro and Wiwynn. These servers will be powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Super Chip, which features two CPUs and the Grace Upper Super Chip, which pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated model. We've introduced new reference designs based on Grace for the massive new workloads of next-generation data centers. CGX for cloud graphics and gaming, OVX for digital twins or Omniverse and HGX for HPC and AI. These server designs are all optimized for NVIDIA's rich accelerated computing software stacks and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA certified systems lineup. The enabler for the Grace Hopper and Grace Super Chips is our ultra energy-efficient, low-latency, high-speed memory coherent interconnect NVLink, which scales from die to die, chip to chip and system to system. With NVLink, we can configure Grace and Hopper to address a broad range of workloads. Future NVIDIA chips, the CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace Hopper based on our world-class SERDES technology. We're making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms. In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum-4, the world's first 400-gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum-4 Switch, ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, Bluefield-3 DPU and the DOCA software. Built for AI and video Spectrum 4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security and powerful features to enable high-performance advanced virtualization and simulation at scale. Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU and SOC quarters over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support the customer demand. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was up 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago, and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures. We expect to maintain gross margins at current levels in Q2. Going forward, as new products ramp and software becomes a larger percent of revenue, we have opportunities to increase gross margins longer term. GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, impacted by a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the ARM transaction. Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.7%. We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year and are now slowing to integrate these new employees. This also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persist. We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20s range this year. we expect sequential increases to level off after Q2 as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not reoccur in the second half. During Q1, we repurchased $2 billion of our stock. Our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase an additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our outlook assumes an estimated impact of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and China COVID lockdowns. We estimate the impact of lower sell-through in Russia and China to affect our Q2 Gaming sell-in by $400 million. Furthermore, we estimate the absence of sales to Russia to have a $100 million impact on Q2 in Data Center. We expect strong sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive to be more than an offset by the sequential decline in Gaming. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the BofA Securities Technology Conference in person on June 7, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 24. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you please poll for questions? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess would love to get an update on how you're thinking about the Gaming cycle from here. The business has essentially doubled over the last two years. And now we've got some crosswinds with crypto falling off, channel potentially clearing ahead of a new product cycle. You talked about macro challenges. But at the same time, only a third of the installed base has RTX and we're moving out from under supply. So we'd love to hear your thoughts from here once we get beyond kind of the challenges around COVID lockdown in the July quarter? How are you thinking about Gaming trends?\nJensen Huang: Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. The -- you captured a lot of the dynamics well in your question. The underlying dynamics of the Gaming industry is really solid, net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia. The rest of the market is fairly robust and we expect the Gaming dynamics to be intact. The several things that are driving the Gaming industry. In the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast. So, many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio. Because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days. The need for GeForce PCs have never been greater. And so I think the fundamental dynamics are really good. And so as we look into the second half of the year, we look -- it's hard to predict exactly what -- when COVID and the war in Russia is going to be behind us. But nonetheless, the governing dynamics of the Gaming industry is great.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good morning. Jensen, I wanted to ask a bit of a question on the Data Center business. In this upcoming cycle with H-100, there's some I/O upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there. I wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically, or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry sort of responding to that potential move? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I appreciate the question. The -- let's see, the first point that you made is a very big point. The next generation of servers that are being teed up right now are all Gen 5. The I/O performance is substantially higher than what was available before. And so, you're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that. Brand-new networking cards from our company and others. Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh. And so, we're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper. There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge. Each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture. So there isn't one size that fits all, which is one of the reasons why it's so terrific that we support PCI Express, that we innovated chip-to-chip interconnect for diverse -- before anybody else did, this is now some seven years ago, we're in our fourth generation of NVLink that allows us to connect two chips next to each other, two dies, two chips, two modules, two SXM modules to two systems to multiple systems. And so our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink has made it possible for us to mix and match chips, dies, packages, systems and all of these different types of configurations. And I think that, over time, you're going to see even more types of configurations. And the reason for that has to do with a couple of very important new type of data centers that are emerging. And you're starting to see that now with fairly large installations, infrastructures with NVIDIA, HPC and NVIDIA AI. These are really AI factories where you're processing the data, refining the data and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload and they're running at 24/7. Deep recommender systems is a good example of that. In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves. That would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications. And then on the other end, you're seeing data centers at the edge that are going to be robotics or autonomous data centers that are running 24/7. They are going to be running in factories and retail stores and warehouses, logistics warehouses, all over the world. So these two new types of data centers are just emerging, and they also have different architectures. So I think the net of it all is that our ability to support every single workload because we have a universal accelerator, running every single workload from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing to training to inference that we can support Arm and x86 that we support PCI Express to Multisystem NVlink to multi-chip NVLink to multi-die NVLink, that capability for us is -- makes it possible for us to really be able to serve all of these different segments. With respect to vertical integration, I think that system integration, the better way of maybe saying that is that system integration is going to come in all kinds of different ways. We're going to do semi-custom chips as we've done with many companies in the past, including Nintendo. We'll do semi-custom chiplets as we do with NVLink. NVLink is open to our partners. And they could bring it to any fab and connect it coherently into our chip. We could do multi module packages. We could do multi-package systems. So there's a lot of different ways to do system integration.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the sequential. So Colette, I know you said the $500 million was a $400 million hit to Gaming and a $100 million hit to data. So I'm assuming that -- that doesn't mean the Gaming is down $400 million. I mean it's Gaming -- do you see Gaming actually down more than the actual Russia and lockdown hit. And I guess just how do I think about the relative sequentials of the businesses in light of those constraints that you guys are facing?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me start first with what does that mean to Gaming. What does that mean to Gaming for Q2? We do expect Gaming to decline into Q2. We still believe our end demand remains very strong. Ampere has just been a great architecture, and there's many areas where we continue to see strength and growth in both our sell-through and probably what we will see added into that channel as well. But in total, Q2 Gaming will decline from last quarter from Q1 that it will probably decline in the teens. As we try and work through some of these lockdowns in China, which are holding us up. So overall, the demand for Gaming is still strong. We still expect end demand to grow year-over-year in Q2.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMark Lipacis: Hi, thanks for taking my question. If you listen to the networking OEMs, this earnings season, it seems that there was a lot of talk about increased spending by enterprises on their data centers and sometimes you hear them talking about how this is being driven by AI. You talked about your year-over-year growth in your cloud versus enterprise spending. I wonder if you could talk about what you were seeing sequentially? Are you seeing a sequential inflection in the enterprise? And can you talk about the attach rate of software for enterprise versus data centers. And, which software is -- are you seeing the most interest? I know you talked about, is it Omniverse? Is it natural language processing, or is there one big driver, or is it a bunch of drivers for the various different software packages you have? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks, Mark. We had a record Data Center business this last quarter. We expect to have a record, another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half. AI and data-driven machine learning techniques for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in the final analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence. We want to produce intelligence. And there are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly. And so I think the trend that you hear other people are experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data driven insights, artificial intelligence. However, it's described, it's all exactly the same thing. And it's sweeping just about every industry and every company. Our networking business is also highly supply constrained. Our demand is really, really high. And it requires a lot of components aside from just our chips. Components and transceivers and connectors and cables. And just -- it's a really -- it's a complicated system, the network, and there are many physical components. And so the supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best and our supply has been increasing from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2 and increase in Q3 and Q4. And so we're really, really grateful for the support from the component industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that. With respect to software, there are two, well, first of all, there are all kinds of machine learning models, computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, all kinds of robotics applications, the most -- probably the largest, the most visible one is self-driving cars, which is essentially a robotic AI. And then recently, this incredible breakthrough from an AI model called Transformers that has led to really, really significant advances in natural language understanding. And so they're all these different types of models. There are thousands and thousands of species of AI models and used in all these different industries. One of my favorite, I'll just say it very quickly and I'll answer that question about the software. One of my favorites is using Transformers to understand the language of chemistry or using transformers and using AI models to understand the language of proteins, amino acids, which is genomics. To apply AI to understand -- to recognize the patterns, to understand the sequence and essentially understand the language of chemistry and biology is a really, really important breakthrough. And all of this excitement around synthetic biology, much of it stands back to the \u2013 some of these inventions. But anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. And that engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. But for enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architecture, support old architectures in their installed base, etcetera, and all the different use cases that they have. And so that engine is called NVIDIA AI. It's almost like a sequel engine, if you will. And except this is an engine for artificial intelligence. There's another engine that we provide and that engine is called Omniverse and it's designed for the next wave of AI, where artificial intelligence has to not just manipulate information like recommender systems and conversational systems and such. But it has to interact with physical systems. Whether it's interacting with physics directly, meaning robotics or being able to automate physical systems like heat recovery steam generators, which is really important today. And so Omniverse is designed to be able to sit at that interface, that intersection between simulation and artificial intelligence, and that's what Omniverse is about. Omniverse has now \u2013 let\u2019s see some -- we're still early in the deployment of Omniverse for commercial license. It's been a couple of quarters now since we've released Omniverse enterprise. And I think, at this point, we have 10% of the world's top 100 companies that are already customers, licensing customers, substantially more who we're evaluating. I think it's been downloaded nearly 200,000 times. It has been tried in some 700 companies. And Colette highlighted some of the companies, you might see some of the companies that are using it in all kinds of interesting applications at GTC. And so, I fully expect that the NVIDIA AI engine, the Omniverse engine, are going to be very successful for us in the future and contribute greatly to our earnings.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks. Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if your Q2 outlook includes any destocking benefits from the new products that you're planning to launch this year? And then my question is gentleman for you. You're still guiding Data Center to a very strong, I think, close to 70% or so year-on-year growth, despite all the headwinds. Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macro economy? I like is there any cyclical impact on Data Center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year?\nColette Kress: Yes. Vivek, let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discussed about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year. So, you should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. I'll turn it over for Jensen Huang for the rest.\nJensen Huang: Thanks. Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, has grown significantly. It's doubled year-over-year. and we're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. And this is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Core GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator. And so you could use it for data processing for ETL, for example, extract, transform and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many sequel functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs. We accelerate Rapids, we accelerate which is the Python version a Data Center scale version of Pandas, we accelerate Spark 3.0. And so from database queries to data processing, to extraction, and transform and loading of data before you do training and inference and whatever image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100. And so we're seeing great success there. on at the core and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. You probably have heard about Deep Recommender Systems. This is the economic engine, the information filtering engine of the Internet, if not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our Internet experience shopping experience with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day constantly and be able to use your three-inch phone to even engage the Internet. And so all of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing call a recommender system second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chat bots and website customer service, even live customer service being now supported by AI, conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service on the one hand. On the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage. And then the third is this groundbreaking piece of work as related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough. But within it, is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained and so much data. And we recently announced Megatron 530B. And it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of \u2013 I think they call it Turing. And this language model and others like it, like open AI, GPD 3 are really transformative and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trade model that is really quite remarkable. Now we're working with thousands of start-ups, large companies that are building who are using the public cloud. And so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud. I think we have now 10,000 AI inception startups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI, whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money, because the computation time is significantly reduced. The quality of service is a lot better and they could do greater things. And so that's driving AI in the cloud. And so all of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI. The thousands of companies around the world that are using NVIDIA AI in the cloud -- driving public cloud demand, all of these things are driving our Data Center growth. And so we expect to see Data Center demand remain strong.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTim Arcuri: Thank you very much. I had a question about this $500 million impact for July and whether it's more supply related or demand related. And that's because most others in semis are sort of setting this China stuff, in particular, is more of a logistics issues, so more of a supply issues, but the language Colette you were using in your commentary side of lower sell-through in gaming and sort the absence of sales in Russia, to me that sounds a little more demand which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have. So, I ask because if it's supply related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing. But if demand related that might never come back and it to be the beginning of a falling night. So, I wonder if you can sort of walk through that for me? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Tim, for the question. Let me try and bet here on the China and Russia, two very different things. The current China lockdowns that we are seeing interestingly has implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in out of the country. It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure. From a demand perspective, it has also been head from the gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown, focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. So, it's impacting our demand. We do believe that they will come out of COVID and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply will sort it out. It's very difficult to determine how. Now, in the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter. But there were plans and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue of probably about 2% of our company revenue historically and a little larger percentage when you look at our Gaming business. I hope that helped.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much Colette and Jensen. I actually really appreciate it that you called out demand from those two companies, it feels like it's healthy to say demand is a problem, so refreshing to hear that. I had a question on the second half and it relates to both Data Center as well as Gaming. So, last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the Data Center has never been better. So, I was wondering if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true, all the orders that you have been getting there intact and you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just want to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays? And then on Gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year-over-year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of Data Centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. And the reason for that is several. One, if you recall a couple two, three years ago, deep learning and AI was starting to accelerate in the most computer science deep companies in the world with CSPs and hyperscalers. And -- but just about everywhere else, it was still quite nascent. And there was a couple of reasons for that. Obviously, the understanding of the technology is not as pervasive at the time. The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. And then now with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly or, quite frankly, oftentimes impossible. And so now, the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence at a fairly effective way and in many industries rather transformative. And so I think, number one, we went from clouds and hyperscalers to all of industries. Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out the inference is by far the harder. And the reason for that is because there are so many different models and there are so many different use cases and so many quality of service requirements, and you want to run these inference models in a small of a footprint as you can. And so when you scale out, the number of users that use the service is really quite high. So using acceleration, using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech to chemistry to biology, you name it. And we do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low. And so the more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. And that, I think, that wisdom is absolutely true. And so the second dimension is training to inference. The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud to on-prem to edge. And then the final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to in just about every industry, find growth. And so as you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical part, vertical industries, which is financial services and retail and telco and all of those vertical industries have also grown very, very nicely. And so, in all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better. And then starting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems. And so, our networking business is growing very, very nicely as well.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for let me ask the question. I just want to maybe just ask this question a little bit more directly. So, it's good to see the team being able to drive \u2013 navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You look strong sequential growth in data center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right? And so, as we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating. You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. And in general, I think previously, you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year. I understand the uncertainty around gaming, but does the team expect continued sequential growth in data center through the remainder of the year?\nJensen Huang: Either one of those answers -- the answer is yes. We see a strong demand in data center, hyperscale to cloud computing to vertical industries. Ampere is going to continue to scale out. It's been qualified in every single company in the world. And so, after two years, it remains the best universal accelerator on the planet, and it's going to continue to scale out in all these different domains and different markets. We're going to layer on top of that, a brand-new architecture Hopper. We\u2019re going to layer on top of that brand-new networking architectures. Quantum 3, CX-7, BlueField 3 and we have increasing supply. And so, we're looking forward to an excellent quarter next quarter again for data centers and going into the second half.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. Wonder if you could speak a little bit about the purchase obligations, which seemed like they were up again in the quarter. And how that \u2013 was that a function of longer-dated obligations or a higher magnitude of obligations? And maybe you could just speak to supply constraints in general. You've mentioned a couple of times in the call, about continued constraints in the networking business. What about the other parts of the business? Where are you still constrained?\nColette Kress: Yes. So let me start here, and I'll see if Jensen wants to add more of that. Our purchase obligations, as well as our prepaid have two major things to keep in mind. One, for the first time ever, we are prepaying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long term. And additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long lead time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have the products coming to market. A good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our Data Center business, which you can imagine, are much larger systems, much more complex systems and those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand both in the upcoming quarters and further. Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply constrained are networking. Our demand is quite strong. We've been improving it each time. But yes, we still have demand -- excuse me, supply concerns with networking still. Is there others that you want to add on, Jensen?\nJensen Huang: No, I thought you were perfect. That's perfect.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for fitting me in. And most of my questions around Gaming and Data Center have been answered. But I guess I'll ask about the Auto segment. While it's still small, clearly, you guys sound confident in that business starting to see \"significant sequential growth\" into this next quarter. I'm wondering if you could help us kind of think about the trajectory of that business over the next couple of quarters? And I think, in the past, you've said that, that should start to really inflect higher as we move into the second half of the year. Just curious if you could help us think about that piece of the business?\nJensen Huang: Several data points. We are just starting. We have just started shipping Orin in the first quarter of shipping production Orin. Orin is a robotics processor. It's designed for a software-defined robotic car or robotic pick and placer or a robotic mover, logistics mover. We've been designed into 35 car and trucks and robo taxi companies and more others, if you include logistics movers and last-mile delivery systems and farming equipment and the number of design wins for Orin is really quite fantastic. Orin is a revolutionary processor. And it's designed as a, if you will, a Data Center on a chip. And it is the first Data Center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, it's safe, it has the ability to be rather resilient as confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. And so Orin is really a technological marvels in production. We experienced very likely the lowest auto quarter in some time for some time. And the reason for that is because over the next six years-or-so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured estimated. And so I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that Orin and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multibillion dollar business. It's on its way surely there. The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major Data Center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area. And Orin is just one example of our work here. We have four pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems. Starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it, to train robotics AIs; second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is omniverse; third, to the memory of the robotics AI otherwise known as mapping; and then finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system, and that's where Orin goes. But Orin is just one of our four pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI. And so I am really optimistic and really enthusiastic about the next phase of the computer industry's growth. And I think a lot of it is going to be at the edge. A lot of it's going to be about robotics.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for any additional closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, everyone. The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities remain unchanged. The effectiveness of deep learning AI continues to stand. The transformer model, which led to the natural language understanding breakthroughs is being advanced to learn patterns with great spatial, sequential and temporal complexity. Researchers are creating transformer models that are revolutionizing applications from robotics to drug discovery. The effectiveness of deep learning AI is driving companies across industries to adopt NVIDIA for AI computing. We're focused on four major initiatives. First, ramping our next generation of AI infrastructure chips and platforms, Hopper GPU, BlueField DPU, NVLink, InfiniBand, Quantum InfiniBand, Spectrum Ethernet Networking. And all this to help customers build their AI factories and take advantage of new AI breakthroughs like transformers. Second, ramping our system and software industry partners to launch Grace, our first CPU. Third, ramping Orin, our new robotics processor and nearly 40 customers building cars, robo taxis, trucks, delivery robots, logistics robots, farming robots to medical instruments. And fourth, with our software platforms, adding new value to our ecosystem with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse and expanding into new markets with new CUDA acceleration libraries. These initiatives will greatly advance AI. And while continuing to extend this most impactful technology of our time to scientists in every field and companies in every industry. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform. We estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize work flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4 and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our Annual DTC conference starting Monday March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in-person for the first time in five years. DTC will kick off with Jen-Hsun's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19. At this time, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jen-Hsun on the data center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium-to-long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that, and if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions, one more time. First question was -- can you -- well?\nToshiya Hari: I guess your expectations for data center, how they've evolved. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Okay. Yeah. Well, we guide one quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth calendar '24, to calendar '25 and beyond. And let me tell you why? We're at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you can tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years. There's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20 to 1. Huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. Generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty -- plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software are being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it. And the third is it is enabling a whole new industry, and this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time a data center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of a company. We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory. And you've heard me describe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data, it transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA builds, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or, search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible startups in digital biology, generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on. And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of data center. And this data center we call AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. But we're seeing diversity -- one of the other reasons -- so at the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that are being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA is doing inferencing. The inference part of our business has grown tremendously. We estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing, because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You can see from their CapEx and their discussions, but there's a whole new category called GPU specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe. There's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI. So they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multi-billion dollar businesses, auto, health, financial services. In total, our vertical industries are multi-billion dollar businesses now. And of course sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them, each one of the regions around the world. The data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data. They want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation, into AI and provision those services themselves. So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West, will surely be replicated around the world, and these AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen a generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed and that's driving our growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. That's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe a year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume it's in some cases the same GPUs you use for training and inference. How solid is that measurement? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: I'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated. And -- but we estimated it. And let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, the recommender systems that people are -- when you run the internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because as you know, the internet has trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there and your phone is 3-inches square. And so the ability for them to fit all of that information down to something, such a small real estate, is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems. These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU acceleration for the re-ranking and it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. And as you know, recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet. Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe. These are all generative models. The list goes on. And none of these, as I mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted Colette -- I wanted to touch on your comment that you expected the next generation of products -- I assume that meant Blackwell, to be supply constrained. Could you dig into that a little bit, what is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained, like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25, like when do those start to ease?\nJensen Huang: Yeah. The first thing is overall, our supply is improving, overall. Our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us, everything from of course the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators, to transceivers and networking and cables and you name it. The list of components that we ship -- as you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip. But the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated things we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind boggling. It is the most dense complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year over year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides and -- through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best. However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from zero to a very large number. And you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a new generation of products -- and right now, we are ramping H200's. There is no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X --ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system. But with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation, so that we could optimize ethernet for AI. And so InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure. Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking and that is ramping, and so we'll -- with all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products and so we work as fast as we can to capture the demand. But overall, overall net-net, overall, our supply is increasing very nicely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Good afternoon, Jensen, Colette. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask I guess a two-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was just getting out on your demand being significantly more than your supply, even though supply is improving. And I guess the two sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that might not yet be turned on? And then I guess Jen-Hsun, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller startup companies, to things in the healthcare arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling and I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about quote/unquote fairly allocating sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry. Thanks.\nColette Kress: Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally. So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for our end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that allocation and both helped us with our communications with them.\nJensen Huang: First, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product road map and transitions. And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place and where and when. And so they know their -- they know the timing to the best of our ability. And they know quantities and of course allocation. We allocate fairly. We allocate fairly. We do the best of our -- do the best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. As you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when the data center's not ready. Nothing is more difficult then to have anything sit around. And so, allocate fairly, and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. And where we do -- the question that you asked about the end markets, that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs and, very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the healthcare companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large-language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies. There's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging. There are warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies. All of these startups, large companies, healthcare, financial services and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. And oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. And so this ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. But at the core of it, we want to allocate fairly with avoiding waste and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments. But if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to make as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Yeah. So let me, highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that we need for manufacturing. But also, often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The length of that need for capacity or the length for the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next two quarters, but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward. So wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long-lead times or things that needed capacity to be built for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yeah. Thanks. Congratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that they should go back to the mid-70s. If you don't mind unpacking that. And also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products and what do you think are the drivers of that comment? Thanks so much.\nColette Kress: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those two quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefit from favorable component cost in the supply chain kind of across both our compute and networking and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. So looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. So we're really looking at just a balance of our mix. Mix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year. And those are really just the drivers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Bigger picture question for you, Jen-Hsun. When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Hey, CJ. Thanks for the question. Yeah, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One, is that it's accelerated. And two, it's programmable. It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally the very beginning when CNN's and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through to RNNs to LSTMs to every -- RLs to deep learning RLs to transformers to every single version. Every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers, every single -- and now time sequence stuff, and every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base. This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor cores, like our transformer engine for Tensor cores, improved new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor cores, meanwhile, supporting the installed base at the same time. And so, as a result, we take all of our new software algorithm invest -- inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand. On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary we can -- like transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper transformer engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better, so our customers installed base is enriched over time with our new software. On the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden amazing breakthroughs in large-language models were made possible And those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand. We make giant breakthroughs on the other hand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in your prepared comments you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also put it out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single digit percent of your total data center business. So I guess the question is what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market and why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that in that opportunity again? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Think of, at the core, remember the US government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. And the U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars if you will, are the restrictions, and so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused. So that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. And that took some time. And so we reset -- we reset our product offering to China and now we're sampling to customers in China. And we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the -- within the specifications of the restriction. And so that's it. We -- this last quarter, we -- our business significantly declined as we -- as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. But after, that hopefully we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, Jen-Hsun, Colette and NVIDIA team. First of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about, a little bit about your software business and it's pleasing to hear that it's over a $1 billion but I was hoping Jen-Hsun or Colette if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business? In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit, so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from.\nJensen Huang: Let me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. And whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them. And their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams and we enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing. As you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing SQL versus -- SQL structure data versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine-learning to computer vision to speech to large-language models, all --recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries. If you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now, people understand that the software is really key. And the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing -- and when -- it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing. All of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem. So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed-base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack. We call it NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market with it is that think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system, it's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge $4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem, will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO, for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: The computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand, with increasing throughput, while managing costs and energy. The incredible speed up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled, a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world. We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this Industrial Revolution. Every company in every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI. Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world's data center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions. This new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies. And now, every industry is on board, from automotive to healthcare to financial services, to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform with industry-specific applications frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem, gives us the speed, scale and reach to help every company -- to help companies in every industry become an AI company. We have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose. So be sure to join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook for $16 billion. Starting with Data Center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, now assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our Data Center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investments in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning, recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our Data Center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning, recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and the systems to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla in autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our Data Center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet the growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Towards the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of Data Center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter. So we believe will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promotes U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and supports U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer compliance solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advance notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100 InfiniBand and NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of consumers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU specialized cloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Julich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All-in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand, as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text to image generation and this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of TensorRT-LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance for half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Norma2 (ph). Combined, TensorRT-LLM and H200, increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just one year. With our customers changing their stack, this is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stock in our DGX cloud, all with enterprise grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI, because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose built for AI, will be available in Q1 next year. With support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for our recurring software, support and services offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnership with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come. Okay. Moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technology now available at price points as low as $299. We entered the holidays with the best-ever line-up for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs to find the most performance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Starfield. Moving to the Pro Vis. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering and simulation use cases and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs offering up to 2x the AI processing ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine tune AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse powered digital twins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxxon (ph) is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous vehicle simulation engine. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SOC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership of Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE for our next-generation automotive SOC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher Data Center sales and lower net inventory reserve, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by Data Center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on November 28; the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7; and the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Just, Colette, wanted to clarify what China contributions are you expecting in Q4. And then, Jensen, the main question is for you, where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just look at the trajectory of your data center, is growth -- it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year. So what metrics are you keeping an eye on to inform you that you can continue to grow? Just where are we in the adoption curve of your products into the generative AI market? Thank you.\nColette Kress: So, first let me start with your question, Vivek, on export controls and the impacts that we are seeing in our Q4 outlook and guidance that we provided. We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business. And we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term. We are though working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license, these products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.\nJensen Huang: Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that, what was largely a retrieval based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a generative method. And it's changed almost everything. You could see that text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-3D, text-to-protein, text-to-chemicals, these were things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past. And these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data is changed. It used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about. And one of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so, has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so, instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use these -- use the software. We'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so the transformation of software and the way that software has done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming hardware in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's two trends: one is related to accelerated computing, general purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have much, much better approaches, call it, accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you can save an order of magnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitudes of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general purpose computing into this new approach. And that's been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about where we represent about a third of that. But there is a new class of data centers and this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past, where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure and that data center stores a lot of files. These new data centers are very few applications, if not one application, used by basically one tenant and it processes data, it trains models and then generates tokens and generates AI. And we call these new data centers AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere, and just by every country. And so if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups and consumer Internet companies, and weren't in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world and they are dedicated to do really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people -- countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data and develop their own AI. You see that in India. Several -- about a year ago in Sweden, you are seeing in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France. But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have and surely every major country will have their own AI clouds. And so I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited, I think, it's 155% year-over-year and strong growth sequentially, it looks like that business is like almost approaching $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already on a $10 billion plus run rate and it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large scale AI factories standardize on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the day rate and the low latency that -- and a very low overhead of InfiniBand that's natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just the network, it's also a computing fabric. We've put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric including computation. We will do 40-point calculations and computation right on the switch, and right in the fabric itself. And so that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand or InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound. And the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you will, renting that infrastructure over the course of four to five years, it really, really adds up. And so InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise. This is enterprise computing what we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently we spoke about one of the models that we're creating, it's called ChipNeMo; we're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. And our company is -- for all of our employee use, doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories we used to train the models. And so we would like the AI to be able to run in Ethernet environment. And so what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet; doesn't replace Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet. And it's optimized for East-West traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield, as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some. And we achieved excellent results. And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so, HP, Dell and Lenovo has the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stack and now they integrate with Bluefield, as well as bundle -- take a market there, Spectrum switch, and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized, at least end-to-end AI solution. And so that's basically it, bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Grace Hopper is in production -- in high volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high performance computing and AI infrastructures, we are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multi-billion dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously has very fast memory, as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic surge, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation. So that you could have a generative AI model be able to refer to proprietary data or a factual data before it generates a response, that data is quite large. And you can also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store it in entire book into end-to-end system memory before you ask your questions. And so the context length can be quite large this way. The generative models has the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand. On the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, you data and be contextually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so that particular use case for example is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's a European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and like to build up a full stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM, because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to a just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTim Arcuri: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility that you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts. I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, China bans would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So I know we're not even into 2024 yet and it doesn't sound like, Jensen, you think that next year would be a peak in your Data Center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that Data Center can grow even in 2025? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Absolutely believe the Data Center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already one of the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world. Now, remember, people think that the GPU is a chip. But the HGX H100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts, it weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- even its passive components are incredible. High voltage parts. High frequency parts. High current parts. It is a supercomputer, and therefore, the only way to test a supercomputer is with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated, the testing of it is complicated, the shipping of it complicated and installation is complicated. And so, every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly. Not to mention, all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking. And the networking, the transceivers, the mix, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so, I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world class. But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. We have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming out from all over the world, as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them, they have to -- they should, they have the skills and surely with us in combination, we can help them to do that build up their national AI. And so, the first thing that they have to do is, create their AI cloud, national AI cloud. You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths. One path -- or if I could say three paths. The first path, of course, just off-the-shelf AI. And there are of course Chat GPT, a fabulous off-the-shelf AI, there'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI, because software companies like ServiceNow and SAP, there are many, many others that can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools and on top of their tools they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base. This is -- they're sitting on a goldmine, almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on a goldmine, and they recognize that they have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI foundry, where we leverage NVS (ph) capabilities to be able to serve them in that. And then the next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches, running our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell, Lenovo, so on and so forth. And so we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs, moving to consumer Internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together and that is a really, really exciting work. And so I think the -- we're at the beginning of a basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to clarify something with Colette real quick, and then I had a question for Jensen as well. Colette, you mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months. Yet, the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue and could it be a source of reacceleration in growth for Data Center in April and beyond or are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited? And then the question for Jensen, the AI foundry service announcement from last week. I just wanted to ask about that, and hopefully, have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work? Is it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long term opportunity set? And is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft or do you have plans to expand to other partners as well? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Toshiya. On the question regarding potentially new products that we could provide to our China customers. It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the U.S. government of our intent to move products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter. So it's just going to take some time for us to go through and discussing with our customers the needs and desires of these new products that we have. And moving forward, whether that's medium-term or long-term, it's just hard to say both the [Technical Difficulty] of what we can produce with the U.S. government and what the interest of our China customers in this. So we stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time.\nJensen Huang: Toshiya, thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company. Our data, our domain expertise, in the case of many companies, we create tools, and most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms, and those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire. And these platforms just got to go across the world and you'll see and we've only announced a few; SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and handout their data, and handout their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us. We have several things that are really essential in a foundry. Just as TSMC as a foundry, you have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability -- AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails, fine-tuned, so on and so forth, that are safe, so on and so forth. And the third thing is you need factories. And that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs are called NeMo and they run on NVIDIA's factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud, where we work together, they bring their data, they bring their domain expertise, we bring our researchers and engineers, we help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible. Then that custom AI becomes theirs. And they deploy it on the runtime that is enterprise grade, enterprise optimized or outperformance optimized, runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud, on-prem, anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year, that's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then with that basic license can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways we're wholesale, they become retail. They could have a per -- they could have subscription license base, they could per instance or they could do per usage, there is a lot of different ways that they could take a -- create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system. And so our business model is help you create your custom models, you run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I wanted to know if it weren't for the China restrictions would the Q4 guide has been higher or are you supply-constrained in just reshipping stuff that would have gone to China elsewhere? And I guess along those lines you give us a feeling for where your lead times are right now in data center and just the China redirection such as-is, is it lowering those lead times, because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship?\nColette Kress: Yeah. Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, there are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which has defined our revenue. But with the absence of China for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply-constrained that we could have sold, but kind of we would no longer can. So could our guidance had been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply on plan, on continuing growing all throughout next year as well towards that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Congrats, everybody, on the results. Jensen, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is, I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and somehow inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive. You'll be less differentiated et cetera., et cetera. So I guess the two parts of the question are: number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workloads. So the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference and I think that's a large part of the workload now. Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Sure. Inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you -- we this quarter announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers called TensorRT-LLM. The reception has been incredible. You got to GitHub, it's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars, integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT-LLM, because CUDA is programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT-LLM, on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. The reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. We've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's in every available from every enterprise system maker, it's used by companies of just about every industry. And every -- anytime you see a NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible, something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it our, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one. And that has conveyed to the world, the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs. And we have such a large installed base, large -- millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPUs from people\u2019s PCs just about every workstation in the world, and they all architecturally compatible. And so, if you are an inference platform and you're deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. And as a software application provider, you're looking for large installed base. Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to curate the data, you have to dedupe the data, maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, process the data, clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not in bytes or megabytes, it's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. And what you -- and ultimately creating a data driven machine learning service. And so data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark, we accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did is called cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world. Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA. And just out-of-the box, without the line of code and so the acceleration is really quite terrific and people are just incredibly excited about it. And Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really data processing, it's for data science. And so NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the history of the tech industry like those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem; silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships and just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time. The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence in data center from two years to now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization in printing CPU, GPU, DPU networking. How do we think about your R&D OpEx growth outlook to support a more aggressive and expanding forward roadmap, but more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?\nJensen Huang: Gosh. Boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan, and so you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT-LLM and H200 reduce the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four, and so that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so we want to accelerate our roadmap for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI, the world's number of data center configurations -- this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of the networking control plane, security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different and yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we then take the whole thing and we create AI factories that are standalone. We take our platform, we can put them into supercomputers, we can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something generative AI Enterprise something nobody's ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that. And so the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. It includes all of the domain specific libraries that we create. The reason why every computer company, without thinking, can integrate NVIDIA into their roadmap and take it to market. And the reason for that is, because there is market demand for it. There is market demand in healthcare, there is market demand in manufacturing, there is market demand, of course, in AI, including financial services, in supercomputing and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain specific libraries is incredibly broaden. And then finally, we have an end-to-end solution for data centers; InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions -- technology solutions and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers; the largest ecosystem of system makers; the largest and broadest distribution partnership network; and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes -- surely that takes a lot of energy. But the thing that really holds it together, and this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When we develop a domain specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so that discipline, that architecture compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now, is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI. Large language models start-ups consumer Internet companies and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. Enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center, an AI factory; optimized for refining data and training, and inference, and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment. Expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI Industrial Revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted three elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride: CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew five-fold year-over-year, and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories. Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI and Ethernet is the standard networking. This week we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution of Bluefield SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HPE and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking and software to the world's enterprises. NVIDIA software and services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise and scale to help customers build custom models with their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise grade NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry. NVIDIA's GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle. Thanks for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With me today from NVIDIA are Jensen Huang, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Colette Kress, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's Investor Relations website.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion. Let me first start with Data Center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models. Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI. There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as [indiscernible] packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions. At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. Our cloud service providers drove exceptional strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter, as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is culminating of nearly two decades of full stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms. Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer Internet companies also drove the very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta, recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models and APIs. We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbot, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud. Virtually, every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI Copilot such as those just announced by Microsoft can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be available to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI Copilot and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers. We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enables users to create 3D scene background with the help of generative AI. We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services. We are collaborating also with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA HGX cloud. And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware. VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure, AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbot, assistants, search and summarization. We also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by [indiscernible] supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers (ph). L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high volume data center standing out to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inventing through the designing, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization. NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers are fully optimized for VMware, Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HP and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Atmos (ph), National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center. And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for giant AI language model, recommendator systems and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA [indiscernible] switch system, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over [indiscernible]. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access. Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of [indiscernible] and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency versus traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies. Now moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktop. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% of the GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops. In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continue to expand. 35 new games added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to gaming. At COMPUTEX, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine or ACE for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to non-player characters. And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face. Now moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse inside. We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation. The NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation. In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in pro visualization for our RTX technology. One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote [indiscernible] earlier this month was the conversion of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D [indiscernible]. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workload. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms based on [indiscernible] or associated with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA's GPU chiplet. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales. Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries on customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center with gaming and ProViz also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York. And the BofA Virtual AI conference on September 11. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Could you please poll for questions for us? Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of large model inference. So I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on large model inference. And I think your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks a lot. So let's take a quick step back. These large language models are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal. It does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language. And it has encoded or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied. What happens is, you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models. It's a process called distillation. And so when you see these smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on and so forth. And you're going to see this going forward. And so you start from a very large model and it has a large amount of generality and generalization and what's called zero-shot capability. And so for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models miraculously has the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical. On the other hand, you would like to have these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices, and so what you do is you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities on a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as good zero-shot capabilities. And so they all have their own unique capabilities, but you start from very large models.\nOperator: Okay. Next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thank you. Just had a quick clarification and a question. Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? You think it's up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%? So just any sense of how much supply because you said it's growing every quarter. And then Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that buy is not really growing that much. So what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years? So if I take your implied Q3 outlook of Data Center, $12 billion, $13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So just give some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.\nColette Kress: So thanks for that question regarding our supply. Yes, we do expect to continue increasing ramping our supply over the next quarters as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, it's not something that we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building an HGX and many of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving their supply.\nJensen Huang: The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed, in the cloud, in enterprise and otherwise. And that $1 trillion of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy effective and the most performant way of doing computing now. So what you're seeing, and then all of a sudden, enabled by generative AI, enabled by accelerated compute and generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. It's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, $0.25 trillion of capital spend each year. You're seeing the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so I think this is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.\nOperator: Next, we go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of Data Center in the quarter, maybe even the guide is like systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100? What I'm really trying to get at is, how much is like pricing or content or however you want to define that [indiscernible] versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?\nColette Kress: Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our Data Center as well as our Data Center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling both of these architectures in the market. Now when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. So both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are great opportunities for enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer Internet companies. The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.\nJensen Huang: And Stacy, if I could just add something. You say it\u2019s H100 and I know you know what your mental image in your mind. But the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly 1 trillion transistors in combination. Takes a robot to build \u2013 well, many robots to build because it\u2019s 70 pounds to lift. And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. And so these things are technology marvels, and the manufacturing of them is really intensive. And so I think we call it H100 as if it\u2019s a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go out really as HGXs sent to the world\u2019s hyperscalers and they\u2019re really, really quite large system components, if you will.\nOperator: Next, we go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the success. Jensen, it seems like a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension like how many person years you've invested in building it? And then part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on the -- what percentage of the value of the NVIDIA platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Jensen Huang: Yeah, Mark, I really appreciate the question. Let me see if I could use some metrics, so we have a run time called AI Enterprise. This is one part of our software stack. And this is, if you will, the run time that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning from data processing, the training of any model that you like to do on any framework you'd like to do, the inference and the deployment, the scaling it out into a data center. It could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center. It could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware. You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud and just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node. It also has multiple sessions or multiple computing instances per GPU. So from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes to entire data center scale. So this run time called NVIDIA AI enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. And that run time is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for our installed base for our stack. And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work. The number of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. And it's taken us two decades to get here. But what I would characterize as probably our -- the elements of our company, if you will, are several. I would say number 1 is architecture. The flexibility, the versatility and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, from data processing to training to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference to the post processing of the data, tokenizing of languages so that you could then train with it. The amount of -- the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. But anyways, that's where we'll focus and it's fine. But when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost ownership. And the reason for that is because we accelerate so many different things. The second characteristic of our company is the installed base. You have to ask yourself, why is it that all the software developers come to our platform? And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large installed base so that they can reach the largest number of end users, so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make. And then the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud, public-facing cloud because we have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers that use our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption to develop and train and to operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot all the way to training and inference. And so we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now, and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. And so reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put NVIDIA's platform in their systems. And so we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach. And then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this really complex stack of software and hardware, networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering. It seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years. Now we're introducing a new architecture, a new product just about every six months. And so these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so those in combination makes us special.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Great job on results and outlook. Colette, I have a question on the core L40S that you guys talked about. Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with? And if you can talk about the incremental profitability or gross margin contribution from this product? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah, Atif. Let me take that for you. The L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing just very large models and a great deal of data. And so that's not L40S' focus. L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models, fine-tune pretrained models, and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transform engine. It's got a lot of performance. You can get multiple GPUs in a server. It's designed for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server, and everything about it is standard and so it's easy to install. L40S also is with the software stack around it and along with BlueField-3 and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snowflakes and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners. L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise. And so L40S is really designed for a different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. And so the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start and the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get L40S deployed.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remains unfulfilled, talking to some of your customers. As good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters. There's a demand, in some cases, for multiples of what people are getting. So can you talk about that? How much unfulfilled demand do you think there is? And you talked about visibility extending into next year. Do you have line of sight into when you get to see supply-demand equilibrium here?\nJensen Huang: Yeah. We have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The demand \u2013 easiest way to think about the demand, the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand. The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs, but the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted. And so what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. And so that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a singular application that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening. And data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting in a broad-based way.\nOperator: Next, we go to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen. Colette, I think last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your Data Center revenue, consumer Internet at 30%, enterprise 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer Internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful. And then Jensen, a question for you. Given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments. I guess I ask the question because there is a concern out there that there could be a bit of a pause in your demand profile in the out years. Curious if there's enough breadth and depth there to support a sustained increase in your Data Center business going forward. Thank you.\nColette Kress: Okay. So thank you, Toshiya, on the question regarding our types of customers that we have in our Data Center business. And we look at it in terms of combining our compute as well as our networking together. Our CSPs, our large CSPs are contributing a little bit more than 50% of our revenue within Q2. And the next largest category will be our consumer Internet companies. And then the last piece of that will be our enterprise and high performance computing.\nJensen Huang: Toshi, I'm reluctant to guess about the future and so I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is recognized for some time now that general purpose computing is just not and brute forcing general purpose computing. Using general purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too energy costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow. And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing and what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs. You save a ton of money in order of magnitude, in cost and order of magnitude and energy and the throughput is higher and that's what the industry is really responding to. Going forward, the best way to invest in the data center is to divert the capital investment from general purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And the number of applications is, well, tons. Lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed. And so I think the data centers around the world recognize this, that this is the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds and you're seeing a whole crop of new GPU specialty -- GPU specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave and they're doing incredibly well. But you're seeing the regional GPU specialist service providers all over the world now. And it's because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest their capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're also seeing that enterprises want to do that. But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security and software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's all VMware. And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support not just the virtualization of CPUs but a virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking. And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. And this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises. And in combination with HP, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI. And so I think the answer to that question is hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend is very, very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to your -- to the compute that you're shipping? In other words, is like half of your compute shipping with your networking solutions more than half, less than half? And is this something that maybe you can use to prioritize allocation of the GPUs? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Well, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs. We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. And the reason for that because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant, some 10%, 15%, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings. Basically, the networking is free. And so, if you have a single application, if you will, infrastructure or it\u2019s largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really a terrific choice. However, if you\u2019re hosting for a lot of different users and Ethernet is really core to the way you manage your data center, we have an excellent solution there that we had just recently announced and it\u2019s called Spectrum-X. Well, we\u2019re going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but some of it, of the capabilities of InfiniBand to Ethernet so that we can also, within the environment of Ethernet, allow you to \u2013 enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities. So Spectrum-X is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3 and it supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. And the additional performance is really spectacular. BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. BlueField, as all of you know, is a project really dear to my heart, and it\u2019s off to just a tremendous start. I think it\u2019s a home run. This is the concept of in-network computing and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with BlueField-3, and it is going to be a home run.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Reitzes: Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for the question, putting me in here. My question is with regard to DGX Cloud. Can you talk about the reception that you're seeing and how the momentum is going? And then Colette, can you also talk about your software business? What is the run rate right now and the materiality of that business? And it does seem like it's already helping margins a bit. Thank you very much.\nJensen Huang: DGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there. DGX Cloud's strategy is to achieve several things: number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We recognize that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world. 15,000 of them are startups. Thousands of them are generative AI companies and the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. We're working with all of the world's AI start-ups. And ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds. And so we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help blend them easily in one of our cloud partners. The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. And so to be able to work closely architecturally to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific. And then thirdly, of course, NVIDIA uses very large infrastructures ourselves. And our self-driving car team, our NVIDIA research team, our generative AI team, our language model team, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite significant. And none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips. And so the internal -- our own consumption of AI, our robotics team, so on and so forth, Omniverse teams, so on and so forth, all needs AI. And so our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud. And so DGX Cloud has multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to just an enormous success. And our CSPs love it, the developers love it and our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.\nColette Kress: And let's see if I can answer your question regarding our software revenue. In part of our opening remarks that we made as well, remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they're our Data Center products, GPU systems or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products. You're correct, we're also selling it in a standalone business. And that stand-alone software continues to grow where we are providing both the software services, upgrades across there as well. Now we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business, and we are looking at NVIDIA AI enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces. So we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for any additional or closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: A new computing era has begun. The industry is simultaneously going through 2 platform transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general purpose to accelerated computing. The $1 trillion of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency and cost. Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. NVIDIA has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world\u2019s industry -- world\u2019s industries can build upon. What makes NVIDIA special are: one, architecture. NVIDIA accelerates everything from data processing, training, inference, every AI model, real-time speech to computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO and best energy efficiency. Two, installed base. NVIDIA has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large installed base to reach end users and grow their business. NVIDIA is the developer\u2019s preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make NVIDIA more valuable for customers. Three, reach. NVIDIA is in clouds, enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments and robotics. Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs, computer OEMs can confidently invest in NVIDIA because we offer significant market demand and reach. Scale and velocity. NVIDIA has achieved significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus and scale to deliver a strong road map and reach to help them grow. We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We\u2019re upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI. While we increased the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we\u2019re ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale, for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers. Spectrum-X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3 Super NIC and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper. We\u2019re extending NVIDIA AI to the world\u2019s enterprises that demand generative AI but with the model privacy, security and sovereignty. Together with the world\u2019s leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware and WPP and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world\u2019s enterprise. We\u2019re building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world\u2019s multi-trillion dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity. Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world\u2019s largest industries, where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for NVIDIA, our customers, partners and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

During this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. And with that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue, with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections. Starting with data center, record revenue of $4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year-on-year, on strong growth by accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories, cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises. First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer AI applications for training and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS, and general availability at emerging GPU specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from Generative AI pioneers. Second, consumer Internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting Generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed it's H100 powered Grand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams. Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom, where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation roadmaps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a 50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question-answering. Auto Insurance company, CCC Intelligent Solutions is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte for logistics and customer service and Amgen for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem. And with the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud. Whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA Base Command, and AI frameworks, and pre-trained models. We provide them with the blueprint for building and operating AI, spanning our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing, and training methods. We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud, that enable businesses to build, refine, and operate custom large language models and generative AI models, trained with our own proprietary data, created for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models, NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D, and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences. Each service has six elements, pre-trained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based sector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning, and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases. ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings, with the 1,000s of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers. Generative AI is also driving a step-function increase in inference workloads. Because of their size and complexities, these workloads require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platform deliver performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry, with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads. To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video, L40 for Omniverse, and graphics rendering, H100 NVL for large language models, and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLMs and also, recommendation systems and vector databases. Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google AlphaFold, and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton inference server with Google Kubernetes engine and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform. In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remain soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand of all training and inferencing. Our 400 gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer Internet platforms such as Microsoft Azure. With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale, optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment. For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI our high-speed Ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching, offers the highest available Ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400 gig Spectrum-4 accelerated AI networking platform next week at the COMPUTEX Conference in Taiwan. Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which is 6x more energy-efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to the growing momentum for Grace with both CPU only and CPU/GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips will enable a new generation of super energy efficient accelerated data centers. Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially, and down 38% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, end demand was solid, and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions, RTX Path Tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex Ultra-Low Latency rendering, and Max-Q, energy efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance and battery life for gamers and creators. And like our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform or software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed-base a spectacular upgrade. Last week, we launched the 60 family, RTX 4060, and 4060 Ti, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs for the first time provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 Ti is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July. Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to run time. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers, and NeMo's LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs, a supercharged platform for generative AI. Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5 is now available with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $295 million was up 31% sequentially, and down 53% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as Public Sector, Healthcare, and Automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicked-off a major product cycle. At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollout planned in the coming quarters. Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstation. Our collaboration with Microsoft transformed windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers, harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, an NVIDIA fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure that includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy, and manage industrial metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year. Microsoft NVIDIA will also connect Office 365 applications with Omniverse. Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitalize their workflows from design and engineering to smart factories and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, Geely Lotus, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $296 million, up 1% sequentially, and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now stands at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years. Sequentially, growth moderated as some NEV customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect slower than expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD, the world's leading manufacturer of NEVs. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the DRIVE Orin to its next-generation high-volume Dynasty, and Ocean series of vehicles, set to start production in calendar 2024. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 64.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak level, and we have absorbed higher costs, and offset them by innovating and delivering higher valued products as well as products incorporating more and more software. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%, We have held OpEx at roughly the same level over the last past four quarters. We're working through the inventory corrections in gaming and professional visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business while also delivering operating leverage. We returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of the Q1, we have approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter fiscal '24. Total revenue is expected to be $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by data center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events, Jensen will give the COMPUTEX keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, May 29 local time, which will be Sunday evening in the U.S. In addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6. And Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on The Age of AI on June 7, and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on June 12. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter fiscal '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 23. Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results, and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to, what the key drivers are from April to July and perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point, what kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Okay. So, a lot of different questions there. So, let me see if I can start and I am sure Jensen will have some following up comments. So when we talk about our sequential growth that we're expecting between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI large language models are driving the surge in demand, and it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing as well as in our networking business. So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance we provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see, and this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers. They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises, but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer Internet companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters and that's led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.\nJensen Huang: I thought that was great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess with data center, you are essentially doubling quarter-on-quarter, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind. Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing their commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best match that supply and demand? Thanks so much.\nJensen Huang: Yeah, C.J. Thanks for the question. I'll start backwards. The -- remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when I -- when the ChatGPT moment came. And it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot. The integration of guardrails and alignment systems were through reinforcement learning human feedback, knowledge vector data bases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way and it's the reason why I call it the iPhone moment, all the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product that can be and what capabilities it can have. And so we were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant as you know. And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs, but on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. And the networking, and fiberoptics, and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the Smart NICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand-up a data center. And so we were already in full production when the moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half as Colette said. Now, let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving towards accelerated computing. It's been known for some time and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full stack problem, but it is full stack challenge, but if we could successfully do it in a large number of application domain has taken us 15 years. If - sufficiently that almost the entire data centers' major applications could be accelerated you could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for our data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It takes -- it costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth, but we\u2019ve been at it for 15 years. And what happened is, when generative AI came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so, now we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions. The world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today, and $1 trillion, $250 billion a year, it's growing of course. But over the last four years, call it a $1 trillion worth of infrastructure installed. And it's all completely based on CPUs and dumb NICs. It's basically unaccelerated. In the future, it's fairly clear now with this -- with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information, it is very clear now that -- and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy efficient, that the budget of the data center will shift very dramatically towards accelerated computing and you're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak. While the world's data center CapEx budget is limited but at the same time we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're starting -- you're seeing the beginning of call it a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of the data center from traditional computing, and to accelerated computing with smart NICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs, and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.\nOperator: And we'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for the question. Could I just wanted to clarify does visibility mean data center sales can continue to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4 or do they sustain at Q2 levels? I just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my question is that, given this very strong demand environment, what does that do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? How do you see the competitive landscape change over the next two to three years?\nColette Kress: Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1. So, we are expecting not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here. But we are not here to guide on the second half of that. Yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.\nJensen Huang: Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction. Start-ups really-really well-funded and innovative startups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects. And many of you know about most of these. And so, we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time. But NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is, we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. And the reason for that is, because accelerated computing is two things that I talk about often, which is it's a full stack problem, it's a full stack challenge, you have to engineer all of the software and all the libraries and all the algorithms, integrated them into and optimize the frameworks and optimize it for the architecture of not just one ship but the architecture of an entire data center, all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models. And the amount of engineering and distributed computing, fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know. And so, number one, it's a full stack challenge and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just the mind blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind blowing. The second part is that generative AI is a large scale problem, and it's a data center scale problem, it's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or to data center is the computer, it's not the chip, it's the data center and it's never happened like this before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer and that's what you're trying to operate. And so in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and you have to understand data center scale, and that's what accelerated computing is. The second thing is that -- utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and diversity of our architecture keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and do one thing only and incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized and it's hard to scale that up. And the thing is, universal GPU in fact that we accelerate so many stacks, makes our utilization incredibly high, and so number one is throughput, and that's software -- that's a software-intensive problems and data center architecture problems. The second is utilization versatility problem and the third is just data center expertise. We've built five data centers of our own and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers and we integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds. From the moment of delivery of the product to do standing up in the deployment, the time to operations of the data center is measured not -- if you're not good at it and not \u2013 not proficient at it, it could take months. Standing up a supercomputer, let's see, some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about a year and a half ago and now they're coming online, and so it's not \u2013 it unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year. Our delivery to operation is measured in weeks. And we've taken data centers and supercomputers and we've turned it into products, and the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible, and so. So, our value proposition is in the final analysis, all of this technology translates in the infrastructure, the highest throughput in the lowest possible cost. And so I think -- our market is of course very, very competitive, very large. But the challenge is really-really great.\nOperator: Next we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the data center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software, considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow? I'm curious of what -- where do you think we're at in terms of that approach in terms of the AI enterprise software suite and other drivers of software only revenue going forward?\nColette Kress: Thanks for the question. Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our nearest architecture and essentially, all products that we have. We are now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing. So, anything that we have here from a DGX Cloud and providing those services, helping them build models or as we've discussed the importance of NVIDIA AI enterprise, essentially that operating system for AI. So, all things should continue to grow as we go forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure, as well as both availability of this offering, our ability to monetize [indiscernible] as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen, if he needs to add.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. We can see in real-time the growth of generative AI and CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that requires a new stack of software and the two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software, because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt, and for your proprietary use-case and your proprietary data, align it to your own principles, and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high performance computing sandbox, and we that DGX Cloud, and create a model. Then you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any Cloud, because you have services and you have agreements with multiple Cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundation for helping you create custom models and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack, GPU accelerated stack in the world that is Enterprise safe, and Enterprise supported. There are a constant patching that you have to do, there are 4,000 different packages that buildup NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine, end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow. It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing, obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data, you have to process and package up and curate, and align and there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data, that could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time and so, data processing is very big deal. And then the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model and the third is deploying model for inferencing. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an Enterprise that wants to deploy their engines, just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software in order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure, it has to be supported. And so, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second point. The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics, you need to align the AI for physics. And aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software defined in robotic applications and industries. And so, Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform. And so our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundation, AI Enterprise and Omniverse runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI as well as Omniverse. With GTP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI and AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them and so I think the -- in order to for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud, and into the world's Enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of -- you need new software stacks in order to make that happen and by putting it in the cloud, integrate it into the world's CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is Open.\nTim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question and then I had a clarification as well. So, the question first is, Jensen, on the InfiniBand versus Ethernet argument, can you sort of speak to that debate and maybe how you see it playing out? I know you need the low late -- the low latency of InfiniBand for AI, but can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out Ethernet like you are with on the compute side? And then the clarification, Colette, is that there wasn't a share buyback despite you still having about $7 billion on the share repo authorization. Was that just timing? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Colette, how about you go first? You should take the question.\nColette Kress: That is correct. We have $7 billion available in recurrent authorization for repurchases. We did not repurchase anything in this last quarter, but we do repurchase opportunistically and we'll consider that as we go forward as well. Thankyou\nJensen Huang: InfiniBand and Ethernet are Target different applications in a data center. All right. They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. And InfiniBand has a really -- NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional roadmap. It's going to be really incredible. But the two networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory, if you will. If that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case and it's doing it continuously and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million. The difference between InfiniBand and Ethernet could be 15%, 20% in overall throughput. And if you spent $500 million in an infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20% and it's a $100 million, InfiniBand is basically free. That's the reason why people use it. InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just -- it's too great to ignore, and you're using it for that one application and so, however, if your data center is a cloud datacenter and its multi-tenant. It's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs and is shared by millions of people. Then Ethernet is really do I answer? There's a new segment in the middle where the Cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not only AI factory per se. But it's still a multi-tenant Cloud but it wants to run generative AI workloads. This new segment is a wonderful opportunity and at COMPUTEX, I referred to it at the last GTC. At COMPUTEX, we're going to announce a major product line for this segment, which is Ethernet focused generative AI application type of clouds. But InfiniBand is doing fantastically and we're doing record numbers quarter-on-quarter year-on-year.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on inference versus training for generative AI. So, you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess, two sub parts to that. Is that, besides inference basically scales with like the usage versus like training is more of a one-and-done. And can you give us some sort of even if it's just like qualitatively, like if do you think are influence is bigger than training or vice-versa, like if it's bigger, how much bigger? Is it like the opportunity, is it 5x, is it 10x, is there anything you can give us on those two workloads within generative AI, it would be helpful.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. You're always -- every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data. And so, you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a Vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured -- unstructured data that you have. And so, whether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, a vector database, these are probably the three major applications of the three core engines, if you will, of the future of computing. It's all a bunch of other stuff, but obviously these are very three very important ones. They are always running. You're going to see that more-and-more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence, an intelligence factory and in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth. The inference part of it, are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that is integrated into workflows. But APIs of all kinds, there'll be 100s of APIs in the company, some of them they built themselves, some of them part that could -- many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. And they'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. And of course, there will be a whole bunch of Internet Service Companies. So, I think you're seeing for the very first time simultaneously a very significant growth in the segment of AI Factories, as well as a market that -- a segment that really didn't exist before, but now it's growing exponentially, practically by the weak for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end, is that, the world has a $1 trillion of data center installed and they used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we know we've heard it in enough places and I think this year there is a ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law. We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale-out data centers with general-purpose computing and that accelerated computing is the path forward and now it's got a killer app and it's got generative AI, and so the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarters capital CapEx budget would lean very heavily into generative AI into accelerated computing infrastructure everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the CapEx budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated net -- networking chips that connect them all. That the easiest way to think about that is over the next four or five, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI and so that's probably the easiest way to think about that and that's training as well as inference.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I want to follow-up on that, in terms of the focus on inference. It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models, but the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. You can talk about the ramifications of that for you guys, is that where some of the specialty insurance products that you launched at GTC come in and just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?\nJensen Huang: Yeah. That's a great question. Whether your -- you start by building a large language model and you use that large language model very large version and you could distill them into medium, small and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you can put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth and they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizeability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile and it can do a lot more amazing things. And the large one would teach the smaller ones, how to be good AIs and so, you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so you start by building very large ones. And then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones. Now, that's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 NBL -- which also have H100 HGX and then we have H100 multi-node with NVLink and so there is -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is, these are models, but they are connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out. So, the input and the output requires a lot of pre and post-processing. The pre and post-processing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart and it's because the length -- the model itself is only call it 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing and post-processing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that. And so, I think the multimodality aspect of inference, the multi diversity of inference, that it's going to be done in the Cloud on-prem. It's going to be done in multi-cloud, that's the reason why we have the AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem, it's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day, called project Helix, that's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow, and Adobe, because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so, there's all the diversity, and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described, in order to really address the whole space of it.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today in your networking products. I mean, it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think so data center networking business is driving a part of $1 billion of revenues per quarter plus or minus, that's 2.5x growth from three years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox. So very strong growth, but given the very high attach of your InfiniBand, Ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run-rate stepping up in line with your compute shipment? And then, what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, datasets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability, and so on?\nJensen Huang: Yeah, Harlan. I really appreciate that. So, nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, the accelerator chip and in fact, it misses the whole point nearly completely. And I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software and networking, remember, we announced a very early-on this networking stack called DOCA and we have the acceleration library call Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it, because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect 10s of 1,000s of GPUs. How do you connect 10s of 1000s of GPUs, if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great, and so that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have -- we have Mellanox as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high performance networking, that's the reason why our two companies are together. You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with a really super low latency and it communicates using memory references, not network package. And then we take NVLink, we connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I described, going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at COMPUTEX in a few days. And then, that gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC, and the SmartNIC BlueField-3 that we're in full production with and the switches, all of the fiber optics that are optimized end-to-end. These things are running at an incredible line rates. And then beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory -- the smart fact -- this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand new type of Ethernet that we'll be announcing at COMPUTEX, and so -- this whole area of the computing fabric extending connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together, all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. And so, we're -- I'm delighted you understand it, and but this -- we don't break it out, particularly, because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be. We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components, so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up, it's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from Cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G and so this way of doing it is really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Congratulations, Jensen, and to the whole team. One of the things I wanted to dig into a little bit is the DGX Cloud offering. You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes, where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business, and the rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago. And as we look forward over the next number of quarters that Colette discussed to high visibility in the data center business. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third-party, their own customers versus what of that big upside in data center going forward is systems that you're selling in, with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business. Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. Thanks Matt. It's -- without being too specific about numbers, but the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs clouds, and the reason -- and our DGX Cloud is -- the NVIDIA stack is the pure NVIDIA stack. It is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one. Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets like, for example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse cloud to the world's industries. And the world's never had a system like that, the computing stack. Now with all the generative AI stuff and all the 3D stuff and the physics stuff, incredibly large database and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks, that kind of a virtual industrial virtual world has never existed before. And so, we partnered with Microsoft to create Omniverse cloud inside Azure cloud. So, it allows us number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. And we go-to-market as one team and we benefit by getting our customers on our computing platform and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one; but number two, the amount of data and services and security services and all of the amazing things that Azure and GCP and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse cloud. And so it's a huge win-win. And for the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they can do it anywhere. So one standard stack runs in all the clouds and if they would like to take their software and run it on the CSPs cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that, because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations. And long-term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSPs clouds. Okay. So, our goal really is to drive architecture to partner deeply in creating new markets and the new applications that we're doing and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run in their -- in their everywhere, including on-prem and so, that -- those were the primary reasons for it and it's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the three CSPs and that we currently have DGX Cloud in and their sales force and marketing teams, their leadership team is really quite spectacular. It works great.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong and now with generative AI supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full stack and data center scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered is the best path forward. There is $1 trillion installed in the global data center infrastructure, based on the general-purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era. Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet the surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content and with models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles and ground the facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications. As we scale with cloud and Internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises. Whether within one of our CSP partners or on-prem with Dell Helix, whether on a leading enterprise platform like ServiceNow and Adobe or a bespoke with NVIDIA AI Foundations, we can help enterprises leverage their domain expertise and data to harness generative AI securely and safely. We are ramping a wave of products in the coming quarters, including H100, our Grace and Grace Hopper super chips and our BlueField-3 and Spectrum 4 networking platform. They are all in production. They will help deliver data center scale computing that is also energy-efficient and sustainable computing. Join us next week at COMPUTEX and we'll show you what's next. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continued to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year-on-year and, well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with Data Center, another record was achieved in Data Center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest product ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2 times faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2 times year-on-year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads. NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped 2 times year-on-year as North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA cloud instances and sovereign cloud buildout. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCL improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA's software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5 times in one year and cut time to first token by 5 times. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper Inference performance by an additional 2.4 times. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mass change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLINK and from liquid-cooled to air-cooled. Every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners and they are working to bring up their Data Centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse Data Center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI Cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer in private preview Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200, and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf Training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2 times leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. Just 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4 times reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLINK Switch enables up to 30 times faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling throughput and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners and Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey, Codeium, Cursor, and Bridge are seeing great success, while thousands of AI-native startups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and Industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Co-Pilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees is leveraging NVIDIA-powered Agentic AI applications internally, including in one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full year revenue to increase over 2 times from last year and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world. Like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents, we built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer is using digital twins and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring up of its Blackwells factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual kilowatt-hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant copper products to industries. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI. India's leading CSPs include Tata Communications and Yotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10 times. Infosys, TSE, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the US with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY, Strategy, and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. The networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing and we intend -- anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3 times year-on-year and our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus, 100,000 Hopper Supercomputer will experience zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue, all growing sequentially and year-on-year. RTX end-demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PCs with up to 321 AI tops from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo and video editing, image generation, and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming computing graphics to igniting the AI revolution, NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI, content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving ramps of NVIDIA Orin and robust end-market demand for NAVs. Volvo Cars has rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix-shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher cost systems within Data Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products, while demand is greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA-build chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled Data Centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR websites. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3rd, in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6th, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7th. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26th, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here as we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces and it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth and it's intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer a question. And so we now have three ways of scaling and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly inference time scaling. And so the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale out for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large and everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the roadmap you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to [Ruben] (ph) in 2026. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that. So if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B, on supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this? Or is it specifically [HBM] (ph)? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Thanks. So let's see, back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply and that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking and of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is on -- is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave, I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of the -- this AI supercomputer and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers in architectures around the world. That integration process is something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, all right, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72 we have x86 or Grace and the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to ramp at the scale you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company, Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron Spill, Amkor and KYEC and there's Foxconn and the many the factories that they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and gosh, Dell and HP and Super Micro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible, Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping up of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our roadmap. We're on an annual roadmap and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual roadmap. And by doing so, we increase the performance, of course, of our platform, but it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training, we're reducing the cost of inferencing, we're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and a data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, 10s of megawatts in the past and now it's most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several 100 megawatts and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are, the power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so on the one hand, our annual roadmap reduces cost, but on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that annual rhythm is really important to us and we have every intentions of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know, Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it that Blackwell will crossover Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low-70s as it ramps. So I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So you're going to be kind of in the low-70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Colette, why don't you start?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim. Thank you regarding our gross margins, and we discussed our gross margins as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that ramp.\nJensen Huang: Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this. And we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that, that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so we expect this to happen this growth -- this modernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar 2025? Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen my main question historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase, or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just the start of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar 2026? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, the periods of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?\nColette Kress: Okay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.\nJensen Huang: The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers. Those -- if you look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's CapEx, if they're ready to build a data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine-learning and generative AI. Because they have plenty of old data centers. And so what's going to happen over the course of next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT. As you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it a couple of trillion dollars. And we have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI, and we're now producing a new type of capability that world has never known, a new market segment that the world has never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence, like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [Reuters] (ph), so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they call AI-native companies are just in hundreds and almost every platform shift there was -- there were Internet companies as you recall, there were cloud-first companies. They were mobile-first companies and now they're AI natives. And so these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift and there's a brand new opportunity to do something completely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one. And then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low-70s gross margins, is 73.5 count as low-70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues and so I mean, total Data Center revenues in the next quarter must be up quote-unquote several billion dollars, but it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong. So like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? Is China has been pretty strong is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4. So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nColette Kress: So first starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and defined low. Low, of course, is below the mid, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%, we're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for our H200, not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that up. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest-growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure, that is across-the-board in terms of all of our different configurations and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also at the same time looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4, it's possible, but we'll just have to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you could use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess, do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12-month time frame, and just generally your thoughts there?\nJensen Huang: Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really succeeded, right. It's when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course and coding, of course. And so we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7. And that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI native startups that are generating tokens and generating AI and every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archive paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so I think -- that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large language models understand the human language and how we the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world and it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't and not only does it understand but it can predict and roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning physics feedback instead of human feedback is now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so that the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference and we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about that. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand, they want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what's -- what they're being asked to do. And so the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger, they're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA on top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on a NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially, but then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about. Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is tremendous and our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of -- in the Data Center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. They're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for taking my question. I have two quick ones for Collette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply-constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply towards data center?\nColette Kress: So first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them and we talked about a lot of them in the call today and the work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stored up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of -- in the Asia-Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding gaming. So our gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more suppliers we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So very strong sequential growth this quarter and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be some catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall, with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the US and the China situation, have you gotten any sense, or any conversations about tariffs, or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much.\nJensen Huang: We guide one quarter at a time.\nColette Kress: We are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we need to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet working seamlessly with us to do that. And once we get to next quarter, we'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next quarter and after that.\nJensen Huang: Whatever the new administration decides, we will of course support the administration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can. And just as we always do. And so we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and compete in the marketplace. We'll do all of these three things simultaneously.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments you have the pre-trainings, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and in inference as well. And then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pre-training, how much for the reinforcement, and how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\nJensen Huang: Well, today it's vastly in pre-training a foundation model because as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online and whatever you could do in pre-training and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do priority. And so you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and a reflection. And so I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on what we are. And in the area of foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes of video that these foundation models are going to be trained on is incredible. And so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pre-training, post-training as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute and we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors at a time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase their revenues and get the AI revolution going. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning. From executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The trillion-dollar installed base of traditional Data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability, but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI. Driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure let us serve the entire multi-trillion dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead. From every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics. Thanks for joining us today and catch up next time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20th, 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going-forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next-generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB 200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion parameter models in real-time. Hopper demand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including X-AI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 times the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on-track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low-double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build Copilots. And lastly, Wistron is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1, collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. Nvidia NIM accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8 times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints, enterprises can refine their AI applications overtime, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM agent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AIPC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designs from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX, AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small large -- small language model, Minitron-4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow, recently added RTX and DLSS titles including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins for factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI Copilots and agents into USD workflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as the Coca-Cola company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at-scale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled ADI, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full-year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-to-upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial detail are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there is a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing? What that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. And so we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell -- Grace Blackwell in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex. And we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customer's customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full-year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook? And how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production, but shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step-back and you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x, you would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly, that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on -- pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand a human represent -- human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so -- which caused the generative AI revolution. Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a capability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what's the -- what are the expected answers, What are our previous observations. And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so you could learn the function of almost anything, you know. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms. And the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the dataset to go train it. And so the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it's not unusual -- it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 20 -- 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly, so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one is, there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities and surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg. What we see are ChatGPT, image generators, we see coding. We use a generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems -- largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs, it's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommended systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper targeting search and user-generated content. These are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners and sovereign AI. Countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use -- they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to. So many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. And then I -- and then General Robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about start building on general robotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.\nColette Kress: And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible, but it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activity is new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong and it's true. The demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is, if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words, but almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data science, toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars, these are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, Nvidia's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number one is the primary -- the number one use-case long before generative AI came along is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. Their renting capacity to model makers or renting it to startup companies and a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money, you -- they want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. So the first person to the next plateau, it gets to be -- gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. So the second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there, is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SOCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why, we drive ourselves so hard. And of course, we also want to see our dreams come true, and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. And so these model makers are the same. They're -- of course, they want to be the world's best, they want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it, they need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper, you know, of course, H200 state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure in Hopper's state-of-the-art.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't know, the ROI on all of this CapEx, and hopefully this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and as you just said, a new plateau and capability. And they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure -- computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through is just go back to first principles. You have trillion dollars\u2019 worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure and the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of general CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized. There's already a trillion dollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build-out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, data processing is pricing, just a giant part of it already. And so recommended system save money, so on and so forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand-up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommended system or next-generation search system? So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth both near and longer-term. I know, Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you could speak to that? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear is because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing our -- we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta, and I think it was Volta. And so we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 times to 5 times, the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid cooling is cheaper, liquid cooling TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink , which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink and that is -- we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously a very low-latency, very-high throughput, large language model inference. And the large domain is going to be a game-changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so I -- I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking-forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be going to be a complete game-changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles. Remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time and that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence learned software.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for the year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\nColette Kress: Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes, hey, thanks a lot for the question, Jensen and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there? Obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks, what are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question, if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter given all those favorable revenue dynamics? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure, and a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. Piece is in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to. And so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be, and where it may even travel to the end-customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs, and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time-to-time. But yes, our China number there are inverse into China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also data center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement in regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. During -- determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more given rising complexity and a radical limit in advanced package world. So curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships and then thinking through consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because, the complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, I realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability fairly uniquely to integrate -- to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year, unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX EPU for East and West, Bluefield DPUs for North and South and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to and then you've got to build -- somebody has got to build up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to serve as ZT. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows us allows us to -- allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply-chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And I -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So anyways, that's the reason why.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the Rack Scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink? You think about GB, NVL72, and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle? I guess put this distinctly, how do you see that mix of Rack Scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?\nJensen Huang: Yes, Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell Rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold, in a disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. You know, some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components, like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX, it's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000 pound rack to be delivered. It's got to be close to -- it has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs. From that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs, we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think that because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply-chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the install -- the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator. We want to be a technology provider.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. That data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top-five things, the top-five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, CPU scaling slows, developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, QVS for vector product vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of -- a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and Alpha-fold two for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a $1 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number-one. Number two, Blackwell is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell Vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides 3 times to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72-GB 200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10 times higher than Hopper, 259 terabytes per second, it kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large language model, token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of NeMo, NIMS, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry, that our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help customer -- companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed-base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation.

And on June 5th, we will present at the Bank of America Technology Conference in San Francisco. With that let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud provider's investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time to train models, the lowest cost to train models and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating Sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's Sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based, Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows Sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe Sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 prove, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe. Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the UK and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the number one, the number two, and the number three spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper's launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads and data center environments in the first year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX Super GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor Cores. Now with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and nonplayable characters. Moving to ProVis. Revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DEXCITE at Dassault Systemes, Brand and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper and Neuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10th as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately, excuse me, approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerated demand -- accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills, and at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?\nJensen Huang: We will be shipping. Well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like?\nJensen Huang: We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air cooled, liquid cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC, that I showed at GTC. And so for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?\nJensen Huang: Well, I guess, there's the big picture view that I'll come to, and then, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multi-modality and Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application -- productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video, so that they can train end-to-end models, to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the Sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. Longer term, that's what -- that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. And so every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the startups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I understand what you just said about how strong demand is. You have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\nJensen Huang: We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect to be -- we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, the computer graphics to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data center. Second, we're in every cloud. And so for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem, we're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more an apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value too is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training. Some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but, it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on, it's going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So I'd like you to -- if you wouldn't mind speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, you're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, okay. And so there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it. So that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership and want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time to train on three-months project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're doing -- we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly? Because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here, but then we disaggregated and integrated into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So I appreciate. Those are the three points.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general purpose framework? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general-purpose. Like for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so there is a -- the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose compute, not for accelerated computing. And so I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run-time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. And now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model. But to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software, that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily a million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it and we're ready for it. And so the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And it's not -- if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about , I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.\nJensen Huang: I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out.\nSimona Jankowski: H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.\nJensen Huang: Well, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so you're going to see liquid cooled version, air cooled version, x86 visions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking. Of course, NICs, we have Ethernet now so that we can bring NVIDIA AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only operate only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there are reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth delivering to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper, Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side, whereby while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\nJensen Huang: Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips, calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like a terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation and your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. CUDA, Varsity, Precision, Grace, Cohere and Connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess, maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\nJensen Huang: Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And so and you can also count that -- count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet is a network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed -- fully committed to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it, the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers and everything just runs. And so I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens and we're going to do that at scale. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session and our call for today. We thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect."}]}
