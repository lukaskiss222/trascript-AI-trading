NVIDIA's earnings call was positive, characterized by strong demand for its new Kepler GPUs and Tegra products, despite facing supply constraints. The launch of these advanced products suggests an uptick in revenue and market share, aided by favorable reviews and a robust PC gaming market. Management expects growth across all segments, with optimism for Tegra's expansion in both smartphones and tablets, including future opportunities in Windows on ARM. The upbeat guidance and ongoing improvements in supply could foster short-term positive sentiment for the stock.
