NVIDIA's earnings call indicates a mixed outlook for the immediate short term. The company's acknowledgment of ongoing challenges, such as the hard disk drive shortage and 28-nanometer production constraints, could cap immediate upside potential. However, the anticipated ramp-up of Tegra 3 and new GPUs, coupled with NVIDIA's strong design wins, particularly in the notebook segment, suggest potential resilience. Despite near-term pressures, the overall optimistic guidance for Tegra growth and strategic product introductions could bolster market confidence temporarily, yet immediate supply constraints may counterbalance any significant rally in the short term.
