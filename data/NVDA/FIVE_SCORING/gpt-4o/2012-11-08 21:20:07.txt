NVIDIA's earnings call presents a strong short-term outlook, with record revenues and gross margins driven by high demand for Kepler GPUs and Tegra processors across various markets. The company's diversification efforts beyond PCs, particularly in automotive and tablets, and the successful integration of its technology in notable products like Google's Nexus 7 and Microsoft's Surface, are positive indicators. Despite some caution expressed about the PC market's outlook, the overall tone remains optimistic. The management's confidence in future growth, as evidenced by the introduction of a dividend and expansion of the share repurchase program, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock in the short term.
