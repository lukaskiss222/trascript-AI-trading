NVIDIA reported a strong Q4 with record revenue and impressive growth across segments, particularly in gaming and data centers. The demand for new GPUs and gaming laptops remains high despite supply constraints, and the increasing adoption of A100 GPUs in data centers shows robust potential for continued growth. NVIDIA's strategic focus on AI, cloud services, and new initiatives like CMP for cryptomining reflects proactive management and market expansion. Given these elements, the outlook for NVIDIA's stock over 1â€“2 weeks is positive, driven by its solid performance and growth prospects.
