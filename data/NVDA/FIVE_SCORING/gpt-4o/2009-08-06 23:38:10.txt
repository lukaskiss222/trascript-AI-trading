NVIDIA reported strong sequential revenue growth and improving gross margins, indicating progress in addressing previous operational challenges. The focus on strategic initiatives such as GPU computing and the introduction of TESLA and TEGRA products appears promising.

Management's optimistic tone regarding future projects and the potential impact of Windows 7 suggest moderate positive sentiment in the short term, although economic uncertainty may temper immediate gains.
