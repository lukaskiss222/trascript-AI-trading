NVIDIA's earnings call reveals mixed short-term signals. The company reported declining year-over-year revenues in Q1, but a sequential increase aligns with expectations. While gaming revenue showed signs of recovery with new Turing-based products, the data center segment faces challenges due to a pause in hyperscale spending, affecting visibility. Management's cautious Q2 guidance indicates continued pressure. Although long-term growth drivers, such as ray tracing and AI, are promising, short-term headwinds from the data center and CPU shortages might dampen immediate stock performance.
