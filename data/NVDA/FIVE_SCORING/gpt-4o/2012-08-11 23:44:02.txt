NVIDIA's earnings transcript suggests strong short-term prospects, primarily due to better-than-expected results and optimistic Q3 guidance driven by their Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3 processors. Despite supply constraints, the company is seeing robust demand, notably in gaming and mobile devices, including the Nexus 7 tablet. Management's confident tone and expectations of improved market share and supply position, particularly in growing segments like Android tablets and non-Apple markets, are positive indicators. Thus, the stock is likely to experience a short-term rally.
