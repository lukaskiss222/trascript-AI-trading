NVIDIA's recent earnings call highlighted strong performance, with revenue increasing 8.5% sequentially and margins exceeding expectations, driven by a richer product mix and momentum in their Tegra business. The company is optimistic about growth in both GPU and mobile processor segments, particularly with new Tegra product launches and the acquisition of Icera, which could strengthen its position in mobile computing. However, certain challenges, such as market conditions for first-generation tablets and expected declines in MCP revenues, were acknowledged. Despite these, the overall positive tone from management and strategic positioning suggest a favorable near-term outlook for NVIDIA's stock.
