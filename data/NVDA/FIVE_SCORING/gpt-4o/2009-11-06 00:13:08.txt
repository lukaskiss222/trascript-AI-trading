NVIDIA's earnings call indicates strong financial performance, with revenue exceeding guidance and high demand for their GPUs. However, the company is facing supply constraints, particularly with their new 40-nanometer products, which is limiting their ability to fully capitalize on the demand surge, potentially leading to market share loss. The optimistic outlook for growth across various sectors, like professional solutions and TEGRA, is tempered by these constraints. The stock may face minimal short-term impact as the supply issues could worry investors, but underlying strong demand limits downside potential.
