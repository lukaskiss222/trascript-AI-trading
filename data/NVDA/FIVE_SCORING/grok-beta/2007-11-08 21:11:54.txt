NVIDIA reported a fantastic third fiscal quarter with record-breaking revenue, net income, and gross margin, achieving its first billion-dollar quarter. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the growth in GeForce desktop, notebook, and Quadro product lines, along with strong market positioning across GPUs, including new products like the GeForce 8800 GT, Nvidia's version of the legendary TI4200, and groundwork laid for entering the mobile application processor market. These achievements signal robust market expansion and product innovation, likely leading to a short-term positive impact on stock price due to Nvidia's exceeding expectations, particularly in high-margin segments.
