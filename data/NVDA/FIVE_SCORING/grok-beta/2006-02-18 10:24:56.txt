NVIDIA's Q4 results showcased significant growth, profitability, and strategic advancements like the GeForce 7 series, NForce 4 MCP, and SLI technology. While the market reception has been strong, the company is guiding a slight revenue increase for Q1, tempered by no expected PlayStation 3 royalties. Despite this, NVIDIA's focus on expanding its addressable market through ULi acquisition, higher gross margin targets, and venture into new markets like handheld GPUs should positively support stock performance in the short term. Noteworthy is the expected benefit from Windows Vista and the high-definition video market. 

The stock price is likely to be positively influenced over the next 1-2 weeks by the:
- Record financial performance and increased year-over-year growth.
- Continued market share gains in the GPU and MCP segments.
- New product announcements and innovation efforts.

While tempered guidance on revenue and some mixed signals regarding competition might have a slight cooling effect, the overall sentiment from the call and the fundamental growth drivers reported suggest a positive market reaction.
