NVIDIA's Q3 earnings reveal strong demand across all product lines, notably in GPUs, which are seeing increased adoption due to Windows 7 and general PC refresh cycles, leading to supply constraints. While this might temper potential gains due to unmet demand, NVIDIA's strategic focus on GPU computing and positive market reception of its new products indicate a bullish outlook. Despite supply constraints, the company's robust product cycles, particularly with TEGRA and the upcoming FIRMY architecture, are likely to support stock price growth in the short term as investor confidence in NVIDIA's ability to capitalize on these market trends grows.
