NVIDIA's Q4 earnings call indicates several growth catalysts that could positively impact the stock over the short term. The introduction of the GTX 560 Ti and GTX 570 GPUs, alongside strong demand for Sandy Bridge CPUs, positions NVIDIA well within the gaming PC market, especially with anticipated major game releases. Additionally, the $1.5 billion licensing deal with Intel and initial revenue from Tegra 2 in high-profile devices suggest both short-term revenue growth and long-term strategic positioning in mobile computing. The company's guidance for increased revenue and improved gross margins due to product mix further supports a bullish outlook.
