NVIDIA's strong financial performance, with record sales and significant growth across various product lines, alongside strategic advancements with CUDA and acquisitions like Mental Images and AGEIA, points to a continued growth trajectory for GPUs in a more visual computing world. Despite competitive pressures and cost issues related to the 8800 GT, management's outlook for growth in the coming year and emphasis on high-end graphics solutions suggests potential positive impacts on stock price in the short term. Anticipation around new products and resolution of manufacturing challenges may also drive investor interest.
