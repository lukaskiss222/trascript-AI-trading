NVIDIA's third-quarter fiscal 2010 earnings call presents several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Strong Demand and Supply Constraints**: NVIDIA reported strong revenue growth, up 16% sequentially, driven by robust demand across all segments. However, the company is facing significant supply constraints, particularly with 40-nanometer products, which is limiting their ability to fully capitalize on this demand[3][5].

2. **Positive Guidance**: Despite supply constraints, NVIDIA's guidance for the fourth quarter is positive, with expected revenue growth of approximately 2% and maintained gross margins. The company also anticipates growth in various segments, including TEGRA, professional solutions, and GPU computing[3][5].

3. **Innovative Products and Market Position**: NVIDIA highlighted its innovative products, such as the FIRMY architecture, TEGRA mobile computing solutions, and strong positions in the workstation and GPU computing markets. These innovations are expected to drive future growth and maintain market share[3][5].

4. **Financial Performance**: The company reported improved gross margins and net income, which are positive indicators. However, the supply constraints and associated costs may impact the ability to fully realize potential revenue and profit growth[3][5].

Given these points, here is the analysis and prediction:

- The strong demand and positive guidance indicate a favorable market environment for NVIDIA.
- Supply constraints, while limiting immediate growth, suggest that demand is robust and that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth.
- The innovative product pipeline and strong market position further support a positive outlook.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to strong demand, positive guidance, and innovative products, despite the current supply constraints.
