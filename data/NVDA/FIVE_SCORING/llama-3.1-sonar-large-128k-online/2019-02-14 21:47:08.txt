NVIDIA's Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings call revealed several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: NVIDIA reported a 24% year-over-year decline in Q4 revenue, primarily due to a 45% decline in gaming revenue. This was attributed to post-crypto inventory issues, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, and slower-than-expected adoption of high-end GPUs with the new Turing architecture[2][3][5].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided cautious guidance for Q1 2020, expecting revenue to be $2.2 billion, plus or minus 2%, and forecasting flat to slightly down total revenue for the full year. This cautious stance is due to ongoing inventory corrections and economic uncertainties[2][3][5].

3. **Segment Performance**: While gaming revenue was weak, other segments like datacenter, professional visualization, and automotive showed some resilience, although datacenter revenue also experienced a sequential decline due to customer caution and delayed deals[2][3][5].

4. **Management Tone**: Despite the challenging quarter, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang and CFO Colette Kress expressed optimism about the company's long-term prospects, highlighting growth drivers such as the adoption of Turing architecture, increasing demand for AI and machine learning solutions, and strong positions in data analytics and autonomous vehicles[2][3][5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the weaker-than-expected Q4 results, cautious Q1 guidance, and ongoing economic uncertainties. However, the management's confidence in long-term growth drivers and the company's strong fundamental position may mitigate some of the immediate negative impact.
