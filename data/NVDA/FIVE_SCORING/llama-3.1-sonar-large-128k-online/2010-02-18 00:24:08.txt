The NVIDIA earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue and Margin Performance**: NVIDIA reported revenue of $982.5 million, above guidance, and a GAAP gross margin of 44.7%, which is significantly higher than expected. This strong financial performance is a positive indicator[2%.

2. **Product Momentum and Innovation**: The company highlighted significant momentum in its product lines, including GeForce, Quadro, Tesla, and Tegra. New technologies like Fermi, Optimus, and 3-D Vision are expected to drive growth and expand NVIDIA's market share[2%.

3. **Supply Constraints**: While supply constraints are currently limiting revenue growth, NVIDIA's ability to manage these constraints and the anticipation of improved supply in the future suggest that the company is poised for further growth once these constraints are alleviated[2%.

4. **Positive Outlook**: The outlook for Q1 is flat due to supply constraints, but the company expects multiple growth drivers to kick in during Q2, including new product launches and increased adoption of technologies like Tegra and 3-D Vision[2%.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial performance, innovative product pipeline, and optimistic outlook.
