NVIDIA's Q4 FY2022 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

## Strong Financial Performance
NVIDIA reported record revenue of $7.64 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and record earnings per share of $1.18, up 103% year-over-year. This strong financial performance, particularly in the Data Center and Gaming segments, is a positive indicator[2][3].

## Growth Drivers
The company saw significant growth in Data Center revenue, driven by hyperscale and cloud demand, as well as strong adoption of their AI technologies. The launch of new products like the RTX 3050, RTX 3070 Ti, and RTX 3080 Ti, and the expansion of the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming ecosystem, are expected to continue driving growth in the gaming segment[2][3].

## Supply Constraints
Despite the strong demand, NVIDIA faces supply constraints, particularly in the Data Center and Networking businesses. However, the company anticipates improving supply each quarter, which should help mitigate these constraints and support continued growth[2][3].

## New Software Business Models
NVIDIA is expanding its software business with new models such as NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA DRIVE. These initiatives, though still in early stages, show promising growth potential and could add significant value to the company's revenue streams[2][3].

## Guidance and Outlook
The company provided a positive outlook for Q1 FY2023, expecting sequential growth driven primarily by the Data Center segment, with revenue projected at $8.1 billion. This guidance suggests continued momentum in the near term[2].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive. The strong financial performance, growth in key segments, and promising new software business models are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
