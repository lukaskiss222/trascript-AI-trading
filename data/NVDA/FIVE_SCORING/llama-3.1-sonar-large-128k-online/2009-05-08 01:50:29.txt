The NVIDIA earnings transcript for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements, which will likely influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Revenue Growth**: NVIDIA reported a 38% increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in the desktop and notebook GPU segments, as well as the MCP business[4].
- **Market Share Gains**: The company gained market share in the discrete desktop GPU segment, reaching 69%[4].
- **New Product Momentum**: NVIDIA saw significant traction with its ION platform, TESLA GPUs in high-performance computing, and the introduction of TEGRA Netbook platforms, which are expected to drive future growth[4].
- **Cost Management**: The company made progress in managing operating expenses and reducing inventory, which improved cash flow and financial stability[4].

### Negative Factors:
- **Net Loss**: NVIDIA reported a GAAP net loss of $201.3 million, or $0.37 per share, partly due to a one-time charge related to a stock option tender offer[1][4].
- **Gross Margin Challenges**: Non-GAAP gross margin was 30.6%, which was lower than expected due to the sale of older 65-nanometer products and a lower mix of high-margin workstation business[4].
- **Inventory Issues**: The company experienced a negative impact on gross margins from the sale of previously reserved inventory, indicating some inventory management challenges[4].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given these factors, the short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The revenue growth, market share gains, and momentum in new products are positive indicators. However, the net loss and gross margin challenges might temper some of the enthusiasm.

### Conclusion:
The overall outlook suggests that while NVIDIA faces some short-term challenges, its strategic initiatives and product momentum could support the stock in the near future.
