NVIDIA's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Growth**: NVIDIA reported a 37% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.15 billion, with significant gains in GPU and professional solutions businesses. However, there was a slight decline of 4% quarter-over-quarter.
- **Gross Margin**: The company experienced a decline in gross margin due to product transition issues, particularly from the G80 to G92 transition. However, they expect a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin in the next quarter driven by manufacturing improvements and better product mix.
- **Market Share and Competitive Position**: NVIDIA maintained strong market share in various GPU categories and is set to announce new products that should enhance their competitive position, especially in the back-to-school season.
- **Guidance**: The company guided for a seasonal decline of 5% in Q2, which is cautious given the historical performance. However, they expect improvements in gross margin and operating expenses to be relatively flat to slightly up.
- **Innovations and Trends**: NVIDIA is driving growth through visual and parallel computing, with significant interest in CUDA technology and its applications in various industries. This suggests long-term potential for the company.

Given these points:

- The short-term outlook is cautious due to the seasonal decline expected in Q2, but the company's strong product pipeline and expected improvements in gross margin suggest a positive trajectory.
- The long-term growth drivers, such as the adoption of CUDA and the increasing importance of GPUs in various markets, are robust.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's strong market position, innovative products, and expected improvements in financial metrics. However, the cautious Q2 guidance might temper immediate gains.
