NVIDIA's Q1 fiscal 2007 earnings call presented several positive and a few cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Revenue and Gross Margins**: NVIDIA reported record revenue of $681.8 million and a non-GAAP gross margin of 42.5%, exceeding expectations. This strong financial performance is likely to be well-received by investors.
- **Market Share Gains**: The company increased its market share in the performance GPU segment and maintained strong positions in other markets, including MCP and handheld GPUs.
- **New Product Cycles and Design Wins**: NVIDIA successfully delivered its GeForce 7 family of GPUs, secured significant OEM design wins, and advanced its SLI technology, all of which are positive indicators for future growth.
- **Exciting Market Drivers**: The upcoming launch of Microsoft Vista, high-definition video formats like Blu-ray and HD-DVD, and the PlayStation 3 all present opportunities for NVIDIA to drive growth.

### Cautionary Notes:
- **Seasonal Challenges**: The second quarter is typically the seasonally lowest quarter for the PC industry, and NVIDIA expects flat revenue due to this seasonal decline.
- **Inventory Build-up**: The company built up inventory in anticipation of new product ramps, which could be seen as a positive sign of demand but also introduces some risk if demand does not meet expectations.
- **Acquisition and Hiring Costs**: The acquisition of ULi and Hybrid, along with significant hiring, added to operating expenses, which could temporarily impact profitability.

Given these factors, the overall sentiment is positive due to the company's strong financial performance, market share gains, and promising market drivers. However, the seasonal challenges and inventory build-up introduce some caution.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report and favorable market positioning, despite some minor concerns about seasonal trends and inventory management.
