NVIDIA's third-quarter fiscal 2006 earnings call presents several positive indicators that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Record Revenue and Growth**: NVIDIA reported a record revenue of $820.6 million, with a 41% year-over-year growth, driven by strong performance in desktop GPUs, notebook GPUs, and MCPs.
- **Market Share Gains**: Significant share gains in multiple segments, including becoming the number one notebook GPU supplier and increasing desktop GPU share to 56%.
- **New Product Launches**: The launch of the GeForce 8800 series, which is expected to drive further growth in Q4, and the introduction of CUDA and Quadro Plex, which open new markets for GPU computing and professional visualization.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Improved inventory management, reduced days sales in inventory, and increased cash reserves.
- **Future Growth Drivers**: Positive outlook for Q4 and beyond, including the launch of Vista, DX10, and high-definition video, which are expected to increase demand for NVIDIA's products.

Given these strong performance metrics, market share gains, and promising future growth drivers, the stock is likely to see positive momentum in the short term.
