The NVIDIA earnings transcript for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue Growth and Guidance**: NVIDIA reported a 17% sequential revenue growth to $776.5 million, which is a positive indicator. The company also provided guidance for a 5-7% revenue increase in the third quarter, suggesting continued growth[3].

2. **Gross Margin Improvement**: Despite a GAAP net loss due to a one-time charge, non-GAAP gross margin improved significantly to 36.3%, driven by better yields and a favorable product mix. This trend is expected to continue with the ramp-up of 40-nanometer products and higher-margin products like TESLA and TEGRA[3].

3. **Innovation and Market Position**: NVIDIA is innovating in key areas such as GPU computing (CUDA), TESLA for high-performance computing, and TEGRA for mobile and embedded computing. These innovations are expected to drive growth and maintain market share, especially with the adoption of Windows 7 and other operating systems that leverage GPU computing[3].

4. **Cost Management**: The company has been effective in managing operating expenses, reducing inventory, and improving cash flow, which are all positive signs for investor confidence[3].

5. **Market Outlook**: The overall sentiment from management is positive, with expectations of continued growth in GPU adoption, particularly in areas like professional visualization and high-performance computing. The integration of GPUs into new operating systems like Windows 7 is seen as a significant opportunity[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong revenue growth, improved gross margins, innovative product pipeline, and effective cost management.
