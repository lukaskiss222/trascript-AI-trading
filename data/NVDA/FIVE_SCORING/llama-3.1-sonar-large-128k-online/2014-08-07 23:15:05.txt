2. **Segment Performance**: The company saw significant growth in its Tegra processor sales, particularly in automotive and mobile devices, and strong performance in its GeForce and Tesla businesses. The datacenter and cloud computing segments also showed substantial growth, driven by higher ASPs and robust demand[4].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company's guidance for the third quarter indicates continued revenue growth, with an expected sequential increase of 9%. This is driven by seasonal upticks in consumer GPUs and further growth in Tegra and datacenter businesses[4].
