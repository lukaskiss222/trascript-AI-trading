Based on the transcript of NVIDIA's third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings call, here are the key points that could influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

- **Strong Quarterly Performance**: NVIDIA reported record revenue and gross margins, driven by strong demand for Kepler GPUs and Tegra 3 products. This positive performance is likely to boost investor confidence[5|.
- **Growth in Key Segments**: The company saw significant growth in tablets, data centers, and automotive sectors, which are critical for its future growth. The Tegra business, in particular, showed a 100% year-over-year increase, and the Kepler-based GPU business also performed well[5|.
- **Caution on PC Market**: Despite the strong performance, the company expressed caution about the PC end market, which could temper some of the enthusiasm. However, this caution is balanced by the company's execution in other segments[5|.
- **Investment in Future Technologies**: NVIDIA is investing heavily in next-generation technologies, including integrated 4G LTE modems and 64-bit processors (Project Denver), which could drive future growth but also increase operating expenses in the short term[5|.
- **Dividend and Share Buyback**: The announcement of a quarterly cash dividend and the extension of the share repurchase program could be seen positively by investors, indicating the company's confidence in its financial health[5].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive, despite some caution about the PC market. The strong performance, growth in key segments, and strategic investments for the future are likely to support the stock price.
