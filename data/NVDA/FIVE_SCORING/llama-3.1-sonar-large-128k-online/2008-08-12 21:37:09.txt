The NVIDIA Q2 FY2009 earnings call highlights several challenges and some positive aspects that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

### Challenges:
- **Revenue and Profit Shortfall**: NVIDIA reported revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share significantly below original expectations due to desktop PC market weakness, competitive pricing pressures, and a delayed ramp of next-generation MCP products[2][3].
- **Warranty Charge**: A $196 million charge for warranty, repair, and replacement costs related to a weak die/packaging material set in certain previous-generation GPU and MCP products used in notebooks[2][3].
- **Inventory and Pricing Issues**: High inventory of 65-nanometer parts and the need to work through this inventory before benefiting from the cost reductions of 55-nanometer products. Pricing adjustments due to competitive pressures have also impacted gross margins[2][3].

### Positive Aspects:
- **Professional Solutions and Other Segments**: Continued strength in professional solutions, with Quadro business growing 38% year-over-year. Notebook GPU revenue was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and the Sony arrangement is expected to contribute high gross margins[2][3].
- **Innovation and Future Growth**: Strong focus on CUDA, Tesla, and other innovative products and initiatives that are expected to drive future growth. The company is optimistic about its growth opportunities in visual computing, including parallel processing, physics simulation, and other areas[2][3].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price is likely to be negative due to the immediate challenges such as revenue shortfall, warranty charges, and inventory issues. However, the company's long-term growth prospects and innovative strategies may mitigate some of the negative sentiment.
