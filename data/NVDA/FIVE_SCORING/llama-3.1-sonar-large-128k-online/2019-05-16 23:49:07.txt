Based on the NVIDIA Q1 FY20 earnings transcript, here are the key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

## Gaming Segment
- Despite a year-over-year decline, the gaming segment showed an 11% sequential increase, driven by the launch of mid-range GeForce products and a strong lineup of gaming laptops. The company expects continued growth in gaming laptops and a return to normalized levels by Q2 or Q3[5].

## Data Center Segment
- The data center segment experienced a pause in spending from hyperscale customers, leading to a 10% year-over-year decline. However, inference revenue saw significant growth, and the company is optimistic about future demand driven by advancements in AI and edge computing[5].

## Guidance and Outlook
- NVIDIA pulled back on full-year guidance due to uncertainty around hyperscale spending and CPU shortages affecting the gaming segment. However, they expect a stronger second half of the year and provided Q2 guidance that suggests some recovery[5].

## Strategic Initiatives
- The company highlighted several strategic initiatives, including the pending acquisition of Mellanox, advancements in AI and edge computing, and the growth of GeForce NOW cloud gaming. These initiatives are expected to drive long-term growth but may not immediately impact short-term revenue[5].

Given these points, the stock might experience a mixed reaction in the short term:

- The pause in hyperscale spending and the CPU shortage affecting gaming laptops could lead to short-term concerns.
- However, the strong sequential growth in gaming, the promising outlook for inference and edge computing, and the strategic initiatives could maintain investor confidence.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term due to the mixed bag of current challenges and future growth prospects.
