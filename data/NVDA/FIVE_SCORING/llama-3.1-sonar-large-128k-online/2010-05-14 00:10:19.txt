Based on the NVIDIA Q1 Fiscal 2011 earnings transcript, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Strong Product Reception and Market Position
- NVIDIA's Fermi-based products, such as the GeForce GTX 480 and 470, have received phenomenal reception, and the company is ramping up production to meet demand. This indicates strong market acceptance and potential for revenue growth[5/.

## Yield Improvements and Supply Chain
- The yields of 40-nanometer GPUs have improved significantly, which is expected to continue enhancing margin profiles. However, there are still some supply constraints, particularly in the high-end segment, which could temporarily limit the full impact of increased demand[5/.

## Diversified Growth Areas
- NVIDIA is seeing growth in multiple segments, including Quadro, Tesla, and Tegra. The Quadro business is recovering well, Tesla had a record quarter, and Tegra is gaining traction, especially with the Microsoft Kin phone and upcoming Android-based devices[5/.

## Guidance and Seasonality
- The company's guidance for Q2 indicates a seasonal decline of 3% to 5% in revenue but expects this to be offset by the ramp-up of Fermi products. Gross margins are expected to increase, and operating expenses are expected to remain flat[5/.

## Market Sentiment
- The overall tone of the call is positive, with executives expressing optimism about their growth prospects, new product cycles, and expanding market share in the high-end GPU segment.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong product reception, improved yield and supply chain dynamics, and diversified growth areas. However, the seasonal guidance might temper some of the enthusiasm.
