NVIDIA's fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2013 earnings call presented several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Record Revenues and Margins**: Despite significant market headwinds, NVIDIA achieved record annual revenues and gross margins, which is a positive indicator[3][4].

2. **Strong GPU and Tegra Growth**: The company saw significant growth in its GPU business, with an 8% increase excluding chipset revenue, and a nearly 30% increase in Tegra revenue. This growth is expected to continue with the ramp-up of Tegra 4 and LTE modems[3][4].

3. **New Product Initiatives**: NVIDIA is investing heavily in new growth areas such as LTE modems, Project Shield, and NVIDIA GRID, which are expected to drive future growth. However, these investments also mean higher operating expenses in the short term[3][4].

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The first quarter guidance indicates a sequential revenue decline, primarily due to the transition from Tegra 3 to Tegra 4 and lower GPU sales in line with PC industry trends. However, the company expects to maintain strong gross margins and is optimistic about long-term growth opportunities[3][4].

Given these points:

- The short-term outlook is somewhat cautious due to the sequential revenue decline and higher operating expenses.
- However, the long-term growth potential, especially from Tegra 4, LTE modems, and NVIDIA GRID, is highly promising.
- The company's ability to maintain record gross margins and its strong market position in GPUs and Tegra processors are positives.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a minor short-term dip due to the sequential revenue decline and higher operating expenses, but the overall positive long-term outlook and strong performance in key segments suggest that this dip will be limited.
