NVIDIA's Q3 fiscal 2019 earnings transcript reveals several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Performance in Non-Gaming Segments**: Data center, professional visualization, and automotive segments all hit record levels, indicating robust growth in these areas[5].
- **Turing Architecture and New Products**: The launch of the Turing architecture and associated products, such as the GeForce RTX series and the T4 Cloud GPU, has been well-received, with strong demand and significant performance improvements[5].
- **Long-Term Fundamentals**: Despite short-term challenges, NVIDIA's competitive position and long-term fundamentals remain strong, with significant growth opportunities in AI, ray-traced gaming, and autonomous vehicles[5].

### Negative Factors
- **Channel Inventory Issues**: Excess channel inventory of midrange Pascal gaming cards due to the post-crypto market decline is expected to take 1-2 quarters to normalize. This will impact Q4 gaming revenue, with minimal shipments of midrange Pascal cards planned[5].
- **Seasonal Decline in Console Revenue**: Expected decline in gaming console revenue due to normal seasonal build patterns will also affect Q4 revenue[5].

### Outlook
- **Q4 Guidance**: Revenue outlook for Q4 is impacted by the need to work down Pascal midrange gaming card inventory and a decline in gaming console revenue. However, non-gaming segments are expected to grow sequentially[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock is likely to be mixed but leaning towards a slight negative due to the immediate challenges of channel inventory and seasonal factors.

### Conclusion
The stock might experience short-term pressure due to the inventory issues and seasonal declines, but the long-term outlook remains strong. Therefore, the short-term impact is likely to be slightly negative.
