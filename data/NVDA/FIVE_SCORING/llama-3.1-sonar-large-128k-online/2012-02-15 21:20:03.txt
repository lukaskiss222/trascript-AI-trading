The NVIDIA earnings transcript from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 presents a mixed outlook for the short term, but with several positive long-term indicators.

### Key Points:
- **Revenue and Margin Impact**: The hard drive shortage and 28-nanometer yield issues are expected to impact NVIDIA's revenue and gross margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The company anticipates lower gross margins due to yield issues with the 28-nanometer process, but expects these to improve as yields increase[4].
- **Tegra Growth**: Despite current challenges, NVIDIA is optimistic about Tegra 3 growth, expecting at least a 50% increase in Tegra revenues, driven by smartphones, tablets, and Windows 8 on ARM devices[4].
- **GPU Market Share**: NVIDIA expects to gain market share in the discrete GPU segment, despite a potentially flat or declining overall PC market due to hard drive shortages[4].
- **Professional Solutions**: The company sees strong growth in professional solutions, particularly with the launch of Maximus and the upcoming Kepler architecture[4].

### Short-Term Implications:
- The immediate quarter may see some pressure due to the hard drive shortage and 28-nanometer yield issues, which could temporarily affect revenue and margins.
- However, the strong outlook for Tegra 3, gains in market share for GPUs, and the promising developments in professional solutions suggest robust long-term potential.

### Conclusion:
Given the short-term challenges but strong long-term prospects, the stock is likely to experience some volatility but may not see a significant negative impact. The positive outlook for future growth and innovation, especially in the data center and AI segments (as seen in more recent earnings reports[1][2][3]), supports a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact.
