The transcript for NVIDIA's Q2 fiscal 2019 earnings call presents several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Positive Factors
- **Strong Revenue and Profit Growth**: NVIDIA reported record revenue of $3.12 billion, up 40% year-over-year, and significant growth in all market platforms, including Datacenter, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive[2][4].
- **Innovative Technology**: The announcement of the Turing architecture, which includes ray-tracing and AI capabilities, is expected to revolutionize computer graphics and open up new markets[4].
- **Diversification and Expansion**: The company is seeing strong adoption in AI, high-performance computing, and autonomous vehicles, with partnerships like those with Daimler and Bosch, and significant traction in the datacenter segment[4].
- **Channel Management**: Management expressed confidence in managing channel inventory, particularly in the gaming segment, which should mitigate concerns about inventory drawdowns[4].

## Neutral to Positive Guidance
- **Q3 Guidance**: NVIDIA provided a solid outlook for Q3, with revenue expected to be $3.25 billion, plus or minus 2%, and continued growth in key segments like Datacenter and Gaming[4].

## Potential Concerns
- **Crypto Impact**: Although cryptocurrency-related revenues have declined to negligible levels, there was some residual impact on gross margins and channel dynamics. However, this is largely considered a one-time effect and is not expected to continue[4].
- **Sequential Growth Comparison**: The Q3 guidance, while strong on an absolute basis, is not as strong on a sequential basis compared to previous years, partly due to the absence of crypto-related revenues[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, driven by strong performance across multiple platforms, innovative technological advancements, and solid guidance. However, the sequential growth comparison and the decline in crypto-related revenues might temper some of the enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the robust earnings, innovative product announcements, and strong guidance, despite some minor concerns about sequential growth.
