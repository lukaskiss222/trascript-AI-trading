NVIDIA's third-quarter fiscal 2007 earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price positively in the short term:

- **Record Revenue and Net Income**: NVIDIA reported a record $1.12 billion in revenue, a 36% year-over-year increase, and a significant rise in GAAP and non-GAAP net income[4|.
- **Strong Product Performance**: The GeForce 8800 GT GPU and the GeForce 7000 motherboard GPU have been highly successful, with the 8800 GT being hailed as one of the best products in NVIDIA's history. This aggressive product ramp and positive market reception are expected to drive continued growth[4|.
- **Gross Margin Improvement**: NVIDIA achieved a record gross margin of 46.2%, driven by the success of new products and increased royalties from PlayStation 3 sales. This indicates strong operational efficiency and profitability[4|.
- **Market Leadership and Expansion**: NVIDIA continues to dominate in various market segments, including desktop and notebook GPUs, and is expanding into new areas such as GPU computing with Tesla and CUDA. These initiatives are expected to drive future growth and maintain market leadership[4|.
- **Positive Outlook**: Management expressed confidence in the fourth quarter, expecting revenue growth in the 5% to 7% range, driven by strong demand for GPUs and new products. There are no significant concerns about double ordering or capacity limitations that would dampen this growth[4%.
