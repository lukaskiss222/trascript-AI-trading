The NVIDIA earnings call for the second fiscal quarter of 2006 presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Record Revenue and Strong Performance**: NVIDIA reported record revenue of $687.5 million, a 20% year-over-year increase, driven by strong performance across various product groups. This positive financial performance is typically a bullish indicator.

2. **Stock Option Review**: The Audit Committee's ongoing review of stock option practices, which may result in non-cash expenses and potential restatements, introduces uncertainty and could negatively impact the stock in the short term.

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expects 8% to 10% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in Q3, driven by increased demand for GPUs due to the upcoming launch of Windows Vista and other factors. This positive guidance generally supports a bullish outlook.

4. **Market Position and Competitive Advantage**: NVIDIA's leadership in the GPU market, particularly with the success of SLI and other technologies, and its strategic position in the wake of AMD's acquisition of ATI, are positive indicators for long-term growth.

Given these points, the immediate short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be mixed due to the contrasting positive financial performance and the uncertainty introduced by the stock option review. However, the overall strong business performance and optimistic guidance may outweigh the short-term concerns.
