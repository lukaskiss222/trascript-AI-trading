The NVIDIA Q4 fiscal 2011 earnings call presents several positive indicators that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: NVIDIA reported a revenue of $886.4 million, up 5% sequentially, and a record gross margin of 48.1%. These figures, coupled with the company's net income of $171.7 million, exceed expectations and suggest strong financial health[3].

2. **Market Share and Product Leadership**: NVIDIA maintained and expanded its market share in the GPU segment, particularly with the GTX 500 series, and saw significant growth in the notebook GPU market due to the Intel Sandy Bridge platform. The company's 3D Vision technology and upcoming products like Kal-El also position it well for future growth[3].

3. **Tegra and Mobile Computing**: The Tegra 2 and upcoming Kal-El processors demonstrated promising growth potential, especially with major design wins and partnerships in the mobile and tablet markets. This expansion into mobile computing is seen as a significant growth opportunity[3].

4. **Positive Outlook**: Management expressed optimism about future growth opportunities, particularly with the ramp-up of Tegra, Tesla, and other new products. The guidance for Q1 fiscal 2012 indicates continued revenue growth and improving margins[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive reaction in the short term due to the strong earnings report, market share gains, and promising outlook for new products and markets.
