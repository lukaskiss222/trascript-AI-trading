NVIDIA's first-quarter earnings call for Fiscal 2023 presents a strong picture despite some short-term challenges. Here are the key points:

1. **Record Revenue and Strong Fundamentals**: NVIDIA reported record revenue in both Data Center and Gaming, with Data Center becoming the largest market platform. The company sees continued strong momentum in these areas[3,.

2. **Macro and Regional Challenges**: The company is facing headwinds due to COVID lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine, which are expected to impact Q2 revenue, particularly in Gaming. However, underlying demand remains strong, and the company anticipates a recovery once these issues are resolved[3].

3. **Product and Technology Advancements**: NVIDIA is launching several new products, including the H100 GPU, Grace CPU, and Orin SoC, which are expected to drive significant growth in the second half of the year. The H100 GPU and new networking products are particularly highlighted as drivers for future growth[3].

4. **Data Center Growth**: Data Center revenue is expected to remain strong, driven by hyperscale and cloud computing demand, as well as broad adoption across vertical industries. The A100 GPU and upcoming H100 GPU are key contributors to this growth[3].

5. ** Guidance and Outlook**: Despite some short-term challenges, the company's outlook for Q2 is positive, with strong sequential growth expected in Data Center and Automotive, offsetting the decline in Gaming. The long-term outlook remains optimistic, with significant growth anticipated from new product launches and increasing demand for AI and machine learning solutions[3].

Given these points, the short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price is likely to be positive, driven by strong fundamental performance, robust product pipeline, and optimistic long-term growth prospects.
