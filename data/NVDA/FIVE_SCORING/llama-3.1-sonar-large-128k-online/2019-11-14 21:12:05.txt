NVIDIA's Q3 FY2020 earnings call presents several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Key Points:
1. **Strong Quarterly Performance**: NVIDIA reported a strong Q3 with revenue of $3.01 billion, up 17% sequentially, and exceeded expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming, as well as hyperscale data center activity[5）。
2. **Gaming Segment**: The gaming business saw significant growth, with RTX GPUs driving more than 2/3 of desktop gaming GPU revenue. The introduction of new GPUs and the success of RTX-enabled games are expected to continue driving this segment[5）。
3. **Data Center Growth**: Data center revenue grew both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong demand for AI hardware, particularly in deep learning inference. The company's T4 GPUs saw record sales, and inference revenue more than doubled year-over-year[5].
4. **Expanding Market Opportunities**: NVIDIA is expanding into new markets such as the intelligent edge with the EGX platform, 5G wireless RAN solutions, and collaborations with major companies like Walmart, BMW, and the U.S. Postal Service[5].
5. **Positive Guidance**: Despite seasonal declines expected in Q4, the company's guidance for strong sequential growth in the data center segment and continued innovation in AI and edge computing are positive indicators[5].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong performance across key segments, positive guidance, and the expansion into new and growing markets, NVIDIA's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
