NVIDIA's Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Record Financial Performance**: NVIDIA reported record revenue, gross margins, operating margins, and EPS, driven significantly by the Datacenter segment, which tripled from the previous year. This strong performance is likely to boost investor confidence.
2. **Broad-Based Growth**: Growth was seen across all four platforms: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive, indicating a robust business model.
3. **AI and Datacenter Momentum**: The Datacenter segment, fueled by AI adoption, showed remarkable growth and is expected to continue this trend. The hyperscale and enterprise sectors are increasingly adopting NVIDIA's solutions, which bodes well for future growth.
4. **Gaming Strength**: The Gaming segment also saw significant growth, driven by the success of Pascal-based GPUs and the rising popularity of eSports. The introduction of GeForce NOW, which brings gaming to a broader audience via cloud streaming, adds a new growth avenue.
5. **Automotive and AI Innovations**: NVIDIA's advancements in self-driving car technology, including partnerships with major automotive companies and the development of the DRIVE PX and Xavier processors, position the company well for future growth in the automotive sector.
6. **Optimistic Outlook**: Management's tone was highly positive, with a strong outlook for fiscal 2018 and expectations of continued growth in key areas such as Datacenter, Gaming, and Automotive.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
