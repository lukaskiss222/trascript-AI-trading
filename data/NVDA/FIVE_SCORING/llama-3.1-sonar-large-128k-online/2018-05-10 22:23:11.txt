NVIDIA's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive factors that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Record Revenue and Profitability**: NVIDIA reported record revenue of $3.21 billion, up 66% year-over-year, along with record gross margins, operating margins, and net income. This strong financial performance is a clear indicator of the company's robust growth[4]).
- **Strong Demand Across Segments**: The company saw significant growth in its gaming, datacenter, and professional visualization segments. The datacenter segment, in particular, had a phenomenal quarter with a 71% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by strong adoption of Volta architecture and AI inference[4]).
- **Innovative Technologies and Expanding Market**: Introduction of new technologies like NVIDIA RTX, TensorRT 4, and the DGX-2 system, along with expanding market opportunities in AI, high-performance computing, and autonomous vehicles, suggest continued growth potential[4]).
- **Positive Guidance**: The company's guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 indicates continued growth, with revenue expected to be $3.1 billion plus or minus 2%, which is in line with or slightly better than seasonal expectations[4]).

Given these strong performance metrics, innovative product launches, and positive outlook, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
