### Analysis

The earnings call for NVIDIA Corporation revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong Q1 sales driven by higher-end GPU products for PC gaming, as well as growth in its enterprise and mobile computing segments. However, the Tegra processor segment experienced a significant decline due to the strategic decision to accelerate the Tegra 4i launch and the ramp-down of Tegra 3 devices. The company expects Tegra 4i certification in Q4 and continued growth in the mobile and automotive markets. The outlook for the second quarter is cautiously optimistic, with expectations for continued growth in GPU sales, particularly in the higher-end GeForce product line. The company also anticipates growth in the GRID enterprise products and new Tegra 4 devices. Overall, the call highlighted NVIDIA's focus on strategic growth and diversification, with a strong emphasis on new computing devices and enterprise solutions.

### Conclusion

The earnings call provided a nuanced view of NVIDIA's performance and future prospects. While the company faced challenges in the Tegra processor segment, the strong performance in GPU and enterprise businesses suggests that NVIDIA is well-positioned for growth. The stock is likely to face short-term volatility due to the mixed results and the uncertainty surrounding Tegra 4i certification. However, the long-term potential remains strong, driven by the company's focus on strategic growth and diversification.
