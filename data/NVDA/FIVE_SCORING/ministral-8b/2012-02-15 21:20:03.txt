### Analysis

The NVIDIA earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported strong financial results, with revenue and net income growing significantly. However, the guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was tempered by the ongoing hard drive shortage and the yield issues with 28-nanometer wafers. The company expects continued negative effects from the hard drive shortage and a decline in Tegra 2 products. Additionally, the gross margin is expected to be lower than previously anticipated due to the lower yields of 28-nanometer wafers. Despite these challenges, NVIDIA remains optimistic about the growth potential in the mobile market and the professional solutions business. The company's strategic initiatives, such as the introduction of Maximus and the launch of Tegra 3, are expected to drive growth in the coming quarters. Overall, the company's strong financial performance and optimistic outlook suggest that the stock could see positive momentum in the short term.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the company's strong financial results and optimistic outlook for growth in the mobile market and professional solutions business. The challenges related to the hard drive shortage and 28-nanometer yield issues are expected to be temporary, and the company's strategic initiatives are likely to drive growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, the stock is expected to see some positive momentum in the short term.
