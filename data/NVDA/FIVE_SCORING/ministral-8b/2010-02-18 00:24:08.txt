### Analysis

The earnings call for NVIDIA Corporation highlighted strong financial performance, with significant growth in GPU sales, particularly in the desktop and notebook segments. The company reported revenues of $982.5 million, which exceeded guidance, and gross margins improved sequentially due to cost reductions and favorable product mix. Management also provided an outlook for Q1, expecting flat revenue and gross margins in the range of 44% to 45%.

However, the call also revealed supply constraints that impacted the company's ability to meet demand, particularly for GeForce products. Management expects these constraints to persist for the first half of the year, potentially limiting revenue growth. The company is investing heavily in new products, including Tegra and 3-D Vision, which are expected to drive growth in the second half of the year.

Overall, while the company's financial performance was strong, the supply constraints and potential for reduced revenue growth in the first half of the year could weigh on the stock price in the short term. The market is likely to be cautious about the company's ability to meet demand and execute on its growth plans.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the supply constraints and potential for reduced revenue growth in the first half of the year. However, the company's strong financial performance and growth prospects in the second half of the year could provide a catalyst for a rebound in the stock price.
