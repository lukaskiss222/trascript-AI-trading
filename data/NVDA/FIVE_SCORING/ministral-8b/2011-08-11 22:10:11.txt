The earnings call for NVIDIA Corporation revealed a strong Q2 performance driven by record notebook GPU revenue and growth in the Tegra and Quadro businesses. The company expects continued growth in the GPU business and a strong Q3. However, the decline in the MCP business and the acquisition of Icera have led to a slight increase in OpEx. The company also expects the Tegra business to ramp up significantly in the second half of the year. Overall, the earnings call was positive, but the impact on the stock price may depend on how the market interprets the company's guidance and the potential for Tegra to meet its targets.
