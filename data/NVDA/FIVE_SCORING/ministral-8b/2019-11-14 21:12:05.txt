### Conclusion

Based on the transcript, NVIDIA's stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term, driven by strong Q3 results and a positive outlook for Q4. However, the company's guidance for gaming revenue in Q4 was down, and there is some uncertainty around the growth trajectory of the gaming business.
