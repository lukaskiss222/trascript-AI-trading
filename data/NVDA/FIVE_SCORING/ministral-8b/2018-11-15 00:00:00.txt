### Analysis:
The earnings call for NVIDIA Corporation highlighted a challenging quarter due to excess inventory from the crypto hangover, which led to slower-than-expected pricing and inventory normalization. The company expects this issue to be resolved by the end of the quarter, but it will impact near-term revenue. Despite this, NVIDIA remains optimistic about long-term growth opportunities in data center, professional visualization, and automotive markets. The launch of the T4 GPU for cloud inference and the RAPIDS platform for machine learning is expected to drive significant growth in these segments. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the inventory issue, but long-term fundamentals remain strong.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock is likely to be negative due to the inventory normalization issue, which will take 1-2 quarters to resolve. The stock may face downward pressure in the next 1-2 weeks. However, the long-term growth prospects in data center, professional visualization, and automotive markets are strong, which could lead to a recovery in the stock price over the medium term.
