### Analysis

The earnings call for NVIDIA Corporation highlights strong performance across various segments, including gaming, data centers, and automotive. Key points include:

1. **Gaming Segment**: Record revenue of $2.27 billion, up 37% year-on-year and sequentially, driven by the new NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs. The RTX 30 series has generated overwhelming demand but faces supply constraints, which will likely continue for a few more months.
2. **Data Center Segment**: Record revenue of $1.9 billion, up 162% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, driven by the strong ramp of the A100-based platforms and continued growth with Mellanox. The A100 is gaining adoption in both cloud and vertical industries.
3. **Mellanox Segment**: Record revenue, up 13% sequentially and 80% year-over-year, driven by sales to China OEM that will not recur in Q4. The company expects a meaningful sequential revenue decline from Mellanox in Q4 but still expects 30% year-over-year growth.
4. **Automotive Segment**: Revenue of $125 million, down 23% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially, driven by a recovery in global automotive production volumes and continued growth in AI cockpit revenue.

### Conclusion

The short-term outlook for NVIDIA's stock is positive due to the strong performance across key segments and the company's leadership in AI and graphics. Despite supply constraints in the gaming segment and the expected decline in Mellanox revenue in Q4, the overall growth prospects remain strong. The company's focus on AI and data center technologies, as well as its pending acquisition of Arm, positions it well for future growth. The stock is likely to see positive momentum in the next 1-2 weeks.
