Based on the transcript, NVIDIA Corporation reported strong Q1 earnings, with record revenue and net income. The company highlighted growth in each of its business segments, including GPU, MCP, handheld GPU, and consumer electronics. Management also discussed the positive impact of the Microsoft Vista operating system and the launch of the Sony PlayStation 3 on the company's growth prospects. However, the company's guidance for the second quarter was relatively flat, with expectations for flat revenue growth. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
