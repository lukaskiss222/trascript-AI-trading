### Analysis:

NVIDIA delivered a strong Q2 performance with record revenue, gross margin, and net income. The company's growth was driven by its GPU business, particularly in the notebook and desktop segments, which grew significantly. The company also announced several strategic initiatives, including a new motherboard GPU for Intel processors, Hybrid SLI technology, and the Tesla line of high-performance computing processors. While the company expects growth in most areas, it also acknowledges manufacturing constraints that may limit supply in the near term. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these constraints, but the long-term outlook remains positive due to the company's strong market position and growth opportunities in new markets.

### Conclusion:
