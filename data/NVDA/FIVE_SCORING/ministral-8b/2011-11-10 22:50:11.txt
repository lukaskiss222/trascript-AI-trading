### Analysis

The NVIDIA earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong performance in key segments such as desktop GPU and professional graphics, driven by the success of new gaming titles and the adoption of Fermi generation Quadros. However, the call also highlighted challenges in the mobile segment, including lower notebook GPU revenues and the loss of design wins such as those with Motorola. The company's guidance for the fourth quarter was relatively flat, with expectations for a slight increase in gross margins and operating expenses. The discussion also touched on the company's long-term ambitions in the handset space, including the integration of Icera and Tegra processors. Additionally, the call touched on the potential impact of the Thailand floods on the company's supply chain and guidance.

### Conclusion

The short-term outlook for NVIDIA is mixed. The strong performance in desktop and professional GPUs, as well as the potential for growth in mobile devices, suggests that the stock could see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks. However, the challenges in the mobile segment and the uncertainty around the Thailand floods could also put downward pressure on the stock. Overall, the stock is likely to experience some volatility in the short term, but the long-term growth prospects remain strong.
