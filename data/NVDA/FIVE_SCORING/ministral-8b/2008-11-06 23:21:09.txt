### Analysis

NVIDIA reported mixed results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, with revenue of $898 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.11, meeting expectations. However, there were several notable points:

1. **Gross Margin Improvement**: NVIDIA improved its non-GAAP gross margins from 39.1% to 41.9%, indicating cost-cutting measures and operational efficiency.
2. **Market Share Gains**: The company transitioned its performance segment GPUs to 55nm, regaining market share and improving ASPs.
3. **New Product Launches**: NVIDIA launched the GeForce 9400M, integrating three chips into one for notebooks, and the Quadro CX for Adobeâ€™s Creative Suite 4.
4. **CUDA Momentum**: CUDA continues to gain traction, with over 750 research papers and 50 universities teaching it.
5. **Visual Computing**: NVIDIA's Quadro technology was used in the Presidential election coverage, demonstrating its versatility.
6. **Macro Economic Concerns**: Despite market turbulence, NVIDIA's GPU business showed resilience, but it expects a decline in revenue for the fourth quarter.

### Conclusion

The mixed results and cautious outlook suggest that while NVIDIA is making strategic moves to regain market share and improve margins, the macroeconomic environment remains a concern. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the economic uncertainty and the company's cautious guidance. However, the long-term potential remains promising with new product launches and strategic expansions.
