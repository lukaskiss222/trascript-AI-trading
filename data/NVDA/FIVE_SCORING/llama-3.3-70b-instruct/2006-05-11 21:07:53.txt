NVIDIA's Q1 fiscal 2007 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by the success of their GeForce 7 products and increasing market share in the performance GPU segment. The company also reported record revenue in their MCP and handheld GPU businesses. Management's tone was optimistic, citing growth drivers such as the adoption of Microsoft Vista and the launch of Sony's PlayStation 3. While the company expects flat revenue in Q2 due to seasonal trends, they anticipate growth in their notebook and MCP businesses to offset declines in other areas. Overall, the call suggests a positive outlook for NVIDIA's stock in the short term.
