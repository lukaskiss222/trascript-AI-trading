NVIDIA's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with record revenue and non-GAAP net income. The company's GPU business is expected to drive growth, particularly with the launch of Vista and the increasing importance of GPUs in computing. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on innovation and expansion into new markets, such as mobile and GPU computing.

The company's guidance for Q1 suggests a normal seasonal decline in revenue, but the overall outlook for fiscal 2008 is positive. The acquisition of PortalPlayer is expected to enhance NVIDIA's position in the mobile market, and the company's investments in new technologies, such as GPU computing, are expected to drive long-term growth.

Given the strong financial performance and positive outlook, I predict a short-term positive impact on the stock price. The company's ability to innovate and expand into new markets, combined with its strong financial position, suggests that the stock will likely rally in the next 1-2 weeks.
