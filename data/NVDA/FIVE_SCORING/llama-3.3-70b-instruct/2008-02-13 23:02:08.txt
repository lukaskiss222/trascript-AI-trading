NVIDIA's Q4 earnings call revealed strong growth in their GPU business, with revenue up 37% year-over-year and annual revenue reaching a record $4.1 billion. The company's focus on heterogeneous computing, CUDA, and Tesla products positions them well for future growth. Despite some cost issues with the 8800 GT, management expects to resolve them and improve margins. The overall tone of the call was positive, with management expressing enthusiasm for the company's prospects in 2008. Given the strong growth and positive guidance, I expect the stock to experience a positive impact in the short term.
