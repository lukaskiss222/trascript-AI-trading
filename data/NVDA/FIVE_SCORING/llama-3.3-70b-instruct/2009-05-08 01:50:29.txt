NVIDIA's earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with revenue growing 38% quarter-over-quarter to $664.2 million, but the company reporting a GAAP net loss of $201 million, or $0.37 per share. The loss was largely due to a one-time charge of $140 million associated with a cash tender offer to purchase certain employee stock options. On a non-GAAP basis, the company reported a net loss of $0.09 per share. The company's GPU business performed well, with discrete desktop GPU share increasing to 69%, and the company gaining share in the notebook market. However, the workstation business was flat, and the company expects it to remain so in the near term. The company provided guidance for the second quarter, expecting revenue to be up 5% quarter-over-quarter, with GAAP gross margins in the range of 32% to 34%. The company also discussed its progress in emerging markets, including TESLA and TEGRA, which are expected to drive growth in the future.
