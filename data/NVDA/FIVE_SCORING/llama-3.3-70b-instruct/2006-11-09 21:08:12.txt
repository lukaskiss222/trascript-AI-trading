NVIDIA's earnings call revealed a strong quarter with record revenue, driven by share gains in desktop and notebook GPUs, as well as growth in the MCP and professional solutions segments. The company's new GeForce 8800 GPU and nForce 680i SLI MCP are expected to drive growth in Q4, and the acquisition of PortalPlayer is seen as a strategic move to expand into the mobile device market. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on improving gross margins and expanding into new markets. Given the strong performance and positive guidance, I predict a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
