NVIDIA reported strong quarterly results with revenues and margins meeting the high end of expectations, driven by the successful launch of Kepler GPUs and robust growth in their Tegra business. Despite short-term supply constraints on 28-nanometer chips, management's optimistic guidance and strategic expansions signal positive momentum. These factors are likely to boost investor confidence and positively influence the stock in the short term.
