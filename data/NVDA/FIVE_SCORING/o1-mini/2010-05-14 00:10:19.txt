NVIDIA reported solid Q1 results with record revenues and strong performance in its GPU, Quadro, and Tesla segments. The positive reception of new products like the GeForce GTX 480 and optimistic guidance on gross margins suggest short-term investor confidence, despite the seasonal revenue dip. This balance is likely to have a positive impact on the stock in the next couple of weeks.
