NVIDIA delivered strong Q1 results with significant growth in gaming and automotive sectors, alongside record gross margins and enhanced capital returns, which highlight robust underlying performance. However, the slightly reduced Q2 guidance due to currency challenges and subdued PC demand may temper investor enthusiasm in the short term. Overall, the stock is expected to remain stable in the next couple of weeks.
