NVIDIA reported a strong Q3 with record revenue and significant year-over-year growth, driven by high demand for its Ampere GPUs and robust gaming segment performance. Management's positive tone, strategic acquisitions like Arm, and optimistic Q4 guidance despite supply constraints suggest favorable investor sentiment in the short term. Supply limitations may temper the immediate upside, but the overall outlook remains positive.
