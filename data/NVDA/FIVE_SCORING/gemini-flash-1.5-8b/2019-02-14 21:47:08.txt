NVIDIA's earnings call highlights a significant slowdown in the gaming segment, driven by excess channel inventory and macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in China.  While management projects a return to normalized levels in Q1, and the launch of the GeForce RTX 2060, the company expresses cautious optimism regarding a full recovery in gaming in 2020.  The data center segment also experienced challenges, due to cautious spending, but management is focused on new revenue opportunities and expanded partnerships to address the broader market.
