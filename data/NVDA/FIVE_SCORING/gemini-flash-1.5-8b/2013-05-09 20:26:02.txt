NVIDIA's Q1 earnings call highlights strong performance, particularly in gaming GPUs (GTX Titan) and enterprise workstation products (Quadro).  Management is optimistic about continued growth in these areas, driven by new product launches and strong customer demand. The company's shift to broadening its GPU reach beyond the PC, with GRID for the enterprise and Tegra mobile products, underscores a long-term strategy. However, the Tegra segment is experiencing a temporary decline due to a planned transition to Tegra 4i.  Overall, the short-term outlook is positive due to strong sales of high-end products, but investors should monitor the Tegra transition for potential short-term fluctuations.
