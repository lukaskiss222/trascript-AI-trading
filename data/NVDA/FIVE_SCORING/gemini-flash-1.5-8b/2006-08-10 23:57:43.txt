NVIDIA's earnings call highlights strong performance in Q2 2006, driven by high-end GPU sales and design wins.  Management's focus on the Vista launch and expanding the SLI platform provides positive short-term sentiment.   The stock option review and limited financial detail, however, introduce uncertainty.  Short-term impact likely positive, but with caution.
