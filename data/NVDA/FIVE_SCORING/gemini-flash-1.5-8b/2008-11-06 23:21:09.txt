NVIDIA's Q3 2008 earnings call highlights strong performance in professional solutions and MCP (Mobile Computing Processors) segments despite a decline in the GPU business, driven primarily by desktop units.  Management emphasizes the transition to 55nm and regaining market share in the performance segment, alongside new product initiatives like the 9400M Notebook GPU and CUDA applications.  While guidance for Q4 suggests a revenue decline, the call emphasizes innovative offerings and future growth prospects, particularly advancements in visual computing and the growing notebook market.
