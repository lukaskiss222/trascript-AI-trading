NVIDIA's Q1 earnings show strong revenue growth (37% YoY) driven by GPU performance, but profitability was disappointing due to challenging product transitions in the GPU business.

The overall outlook is for seasonality in Q2, but with potential upside from new product releases, especially CUDA-enabled applications and the impending back-to-school season.
