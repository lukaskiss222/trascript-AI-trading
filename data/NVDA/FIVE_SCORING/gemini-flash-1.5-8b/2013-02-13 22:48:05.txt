NVIDIA's earnings call highlights strong performance across various segments, particularly in gaming and mobile, despite a general PC market slowdown.  Management's focus on new growth areas like cloud gaming, LTE connectivity, and the GRID platform, combined with strong market share gains in GPUs, suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth.  The transition to Tegra 4 and the performance of new products like Project Shield are key factors driving confidence in the company's short-term and long-term success.
