NVIDIA's earnings call highlights a short-term headwind from excess Pascal mid-range gaming card inventory.  While management is optimistic about the long-term growth potential of Turing-based products and other segments like data centers and professional visualization, the current situation suggests cautious stock movement for the next few weeks.  The focus on inventory correction and a slower-than-expected normalization of gaming card pricing will likely put downward pressure on the stock price.
