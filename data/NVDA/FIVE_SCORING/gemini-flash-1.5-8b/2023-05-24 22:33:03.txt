Management anticipates continued sequential growth in Q2, driven by substantial supply procurement for the second half of the year, and sees this trend extending into future quarters as well. The company's focus on software and networking solutions, coupled with its diverse product portfolio (including new inference platforms and expanding partnerships), suggests a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
