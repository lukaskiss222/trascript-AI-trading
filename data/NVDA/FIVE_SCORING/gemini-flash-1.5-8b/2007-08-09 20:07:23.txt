NVIDIA's Q2 earnings call highlighted strong performance, exceeding expectations across GPU segments, particularly notebooks.  Management's optimistic outlook for Q3, driven by the strong back-to-school/holiday season, coupled with the launch of new products and expanding application domains, suggests continued positive momentum.  Supply constraints remain, but the company's focus on managing those issues and maintaining its growth trajectory suggests the stock should hold steady or see mild gains.
