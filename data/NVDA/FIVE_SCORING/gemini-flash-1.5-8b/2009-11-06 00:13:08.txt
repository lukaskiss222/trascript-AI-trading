NVIDIA's earnings call highlighted strong GPU demand, exceeding guidance, driven by robust PC sales and new applications.  Management emphasizes supply constraints as a key factor in their outlook, projecting continued pressure on short-term growth but signaling that strength in other areas (professional solutions, mobile) will mitigate it.  The company's focus on innovative products like FIRMY and TEGRA positions them for long-term growth, suggesting likely short-term stock price appreciation related to this positive outlook.
