NVIDIA's earnings call highlighted strong growth across gaming, accelerated computing, and automotive, driven by new Maxwell architecture GPUs, and increased demand for Tesla GPUs in cloud computing.  Management expressed optimism about the continued growth of these platforms and upcoming innovations, particularly in autonomous driving, while acknowledging a decline in the Tegra processor segment.  These positive signals, coupled with a record revenue and positive guidance suggest potential short-term stock price gains.
