NVIDIA's Q2 earnings call highlighted significant challenges, primarily due to a weakening desktop PC market, competitive pricing pressures, and a delayed ramp of next-generation products.  The company took a large non-recurring charge for warranty issues, and while it emphasizes growth opportunities in professional solutions and mobile, the short-term outlook appears negative with expected downward revenue pressure and margin compression.  The stock is likely to experience significant negative impact due to the confluence of these factors.
