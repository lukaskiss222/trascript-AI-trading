NVIDIA's Q1 2016 earnings show strong performance across key segments, particularly gaming (driven by Maxwell architecture and TITAN X launch) and automotive.  The company's guidance for Q2 reflects some headwinds, including weakness in PC OEM sales and European currency fluctuations, but the outlook emphasizes ongoing growth potential in gaming, high-performance computing, and automotive.  The strategic shift towards platforms over individual components, coupled with positive developments in deep learning, positions the company for continued growth despite near-term market pressures.
