NVIDIA's earnings call highlights a challenging economic environment impacting PC sales, particularly in the notebook market due to the rise of low-cost netbooks.  While management expresses confidence in not seeing further revenue declines and anticipates flat-to-slightly-up revenue in Q1, the company's focus on new products like Ion and Tesla for high-performance computing suggests a long-term strategy to maintain market share amidst the downturn.  The likely short-term impact is likely to be muted, dependent on the actual numbers for Q1, rather than a significant price movement.
