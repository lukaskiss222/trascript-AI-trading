NVIDIA's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 results, exceeding expectations, driven by significant growth in data center revenue, particularly in generative AI.  Management's commentary emphasizes the long-term potential of accelerated computing and generative AI, with continued anticipated demand exceeding supply for new products like H200 and Spectrum-X.  This, coupled with strong gaming and pro visualization numbers, suggests the stock price will likely continue its positive trajectory in the short term (1-2 weeks).
