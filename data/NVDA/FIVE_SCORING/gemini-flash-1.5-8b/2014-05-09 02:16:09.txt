NVIDIA's Q1 fiscal 2015 earnings call highlighted strong performance, exceeding expectations across several key segments, particularly gaming and data center.  Positive guidance for Q2 and the continued strength of the GeForce lineup, coupled with management's confidence in long-term visual computing trends, point to a positive short-term outlook for the stock.  Strong market demand for advanced GPUs and the company's expanding ecosystem across diverse sectors suggests a positive impact on the stock price over the next few weeks.
