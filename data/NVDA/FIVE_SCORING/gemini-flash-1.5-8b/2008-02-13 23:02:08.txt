NVIDIA's earnings call highlights strong Q4 results with record revenue and earnings driven by the GeForce 8800 series, particularly the 8800GT.  Management expressed confidence in continued growth, citing the increasing importance of GPUs in visual computing and the optimized PC design approach.  Guidance for Q1 suggests slightly lower revenue than seasonal, but with continued strength in desktop GPUs, which should cushion the impact on the stock.
