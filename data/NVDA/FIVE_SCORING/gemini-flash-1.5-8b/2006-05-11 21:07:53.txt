NVIDIA's Q1 2007 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth and record gross margins primarily driven by the new GeForce 7 GPU family.  Management anticipates a relatively flat revenue outlook for Q2 due to seasonal PC market weakness but anticipates continued growth in notebooks and MCPs. They're projecting share gains in the desktop market, further buoyed by the introduction of SLI technology to notebooks and the adoption of Microsoft Vista, which is expected to drive further demand for discrete GPUs.  This positive outlook, coupled with record revenue growth and strong guidance, suggests a likely positive short-term impact on the stock.
