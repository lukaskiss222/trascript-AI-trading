NVIDIA's Q2 earnings call highlighted strong performance in high-end GPU segments (desktop, workstations, and servers), exceeding expectations and setting a record for gross margins.  Management expressed optimism about the future of PC gaming, despite the tablet market's impact on entry-level laptops. The SHIELD launch is off to a good start, and management sees substantial future growth potential with new Tegra 4 devices emerging in the coming quarters. The call also revealed initial concerns regarding the decline in Tegra revenue, though management anticipates a significant rebound and substantial growth from a trough quarter in Q3 and Q4.
