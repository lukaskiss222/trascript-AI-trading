NVIDIA's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 results and optimistic guidance for future growth, driven by strong GPU demand and new product introductions like Optimus and Tegra.  Management emphasized supply constraints as a key factor limiting further revenue growth in Q1, but projected continued, steady improvement in the following quarters, driven by new product launches and growing demand for GPUs.  The company's focus on new markets, such as tablets, and continued innovation in products like Fermi present significant long-term potential.
