Considerable challenges remain, including legal issues, but NVIDIA's Q2 results surpass expectations. A $777 million revenue and improved gross margins of 36.3% (excluding charges) indicate a gradual recovery. The focus on GPU computing and the upcoming Microsoft and Apple OS releases bode well for the future. Management's explicit guidance for Q3 revenue growth of 5â€“7% and continued margin improvement is positive. The stock should experience a mild boost in the short term.
