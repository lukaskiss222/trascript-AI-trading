Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a strong positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. The company reported exceptional Q3 results, including record revenue ($1.12B), record net income, and record gross margins (46.2%), significantly exceeding expectations.

2. Management provided strong Q4 guidance of 5-7% sequential growth, with continued margin strength and new product momentum, particularly around the highly successful GeForce 8800 GT launch.

3. The company demonstrated strong execution across multiple growth drivers including discrete GPUs (up 30% YoY), motherboard GPUs (up 50% YoY), and professional solutions (up 37% YoY), while expanding into new markets like Tesla/CUDA.

The combination of strong current results, positive forward guidance, and clear momentum across multiple growth vectors suggests the stock should see significant positive momentum in the near term.
