Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a significant positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Record quarterly revenue and strong growth across GPU segments despite supply constraints, indicating robust underlying demand
2. Launch of new Fermi architecture and product cycle across multiple segments (GeForce, Quadro, Tesla)
3. Strong guidance and management commentary around growth drivers (3D Vision, Tegra, workstation recovery)
4. Supply constraints are limiting upside rather than demand issues, suggesting continued strength
5. Gross margin expansion and positive mix shift toward higher-margin products

While supply constraints are a near-term headwind, the overall business momentum, new product cycles, and management's confident tone suggest the stock should react positively as investors focus on growth opportunities rather than temporary limitations.
