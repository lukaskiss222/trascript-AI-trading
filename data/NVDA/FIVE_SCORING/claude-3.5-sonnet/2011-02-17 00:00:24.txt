Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give NVIDIA a very positive rating for short-term stock performance. Here's why:

1. Strong execution across multiple growth segments:
- Record gross margins
- Tesla reaching $100M in revenue
- Major design wins in Tegra for mobile/tablets
- Strong GPU market share gains (61% in desktop)

2. Bullish forward-looking indicators:
- Guided 6-8% sequential revenue growth
- Expanding gross margins into low 50s
- Major product cycles (Sandy Bridge, Tegra 2, Kal-El)
- Strong demand signals from key customers

3. Management confidence and strategy:
- CEO very optimistic about growth opportunities
- Clear technology leadership position
- Strong competitive positioning vs rivals
- Multiple catalysts identified for near-term growth

The combination of strong current execution, positive guidance, and multiple growth drivers suggests the stock should perform well in the next 1-2 weeks.
