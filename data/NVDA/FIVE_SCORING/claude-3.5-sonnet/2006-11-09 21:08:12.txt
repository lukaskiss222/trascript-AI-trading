Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a strong positive impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. The company reported record quarterly revenue of $820.6M (up 41% YoY) and provided optimistic guidance for 5% growth next quarter, demonstrating strong momentum.

2. NVIDIA announced the revolutionary GeForce 8800 GPU architecture which positions them significantly ahead of competitors in the high-end graphics market.

3. Management struck a very confident tone about growth opportunities across all business segments heading into 2007, including notebooks, chipsets, handhelds, and professional graphics.

4. The company continues to gain market share while maintaining strong gross margins around 43%, with expectations for further margin improvement.

The combination of strong current execution, technology leadership with the G80 architecture, and multiple growth catalysts suggests the stock should see significant positive momentum in the near-term.
