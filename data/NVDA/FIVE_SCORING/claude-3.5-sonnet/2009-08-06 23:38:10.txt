Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong financial results with revenue up 17% QoQ and return to non-GAAP profitability
2. Gross margins improved significantly (up 560 basis points) with guidance for further improvement
3. Management expressed confidence across all business segments with particular strength in new growth areas like TESLA and TEGRA
4. Successfully addressed the previous quarter's inventory issues (reduced by $48M)
5. Leadership commentary was optimistic about demand trends and competitive positioning

While there was some caution around economic uncertainty and a conservative Q3 revenue guide (5-7% growth), the overall tone and fundamentals point to positive momentum.
