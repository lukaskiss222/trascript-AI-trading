Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderate negative short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's why:

Key negative factors:
- Significant Q2 revenue shortfall and earnings miss
- Gross margin pressure due to pricing adjustments and inventory issues
- $196M warranty charge for GPU failures
- Desktop GPU segment weakness (-40% QoQ)
- Management acknowledges missteps in competitive positioning

Mitigating positive factors:
- Strong professional solutions growth (+38% YoY)
- Price adjustments completed, suggesting stabilization
- Transition to 55nm process underway
- Growing CUDA/Tesla opportunities
- Expanded share buyback program

While there are some encouraging long-term growth drivers, the near-term headwinds from margin pressure, inventory challenges, and market weakness will likely weigh on the stock in the immediate future. Management's tone suggested recovery would take multiple quarters.
