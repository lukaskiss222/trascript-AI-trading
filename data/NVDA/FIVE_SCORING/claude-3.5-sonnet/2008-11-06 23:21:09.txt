Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of NVIDIA's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Successfully transitioned to 55nm manufacturing
- Strong progress in notebook market with new 9400M GPU
- Maintained gross margins at 41.9% despite challenges
- Healthy workstation/professional segment

Key Concerns:
- Revenue guidance of -5% for next quarter
- High inventory levels (90 days DSI)
- Macro uncertainty impacting consumer demand
- Lost market share in desktop GPU segment

The guidance for next quarter suggests continued challenges, but management expressed confidence in regaining market share and expanding into new growth segments like notebooks and professional graphics. The transition to 55nm is complete which should help margins, but macro headwinds remain a concern.

While there are some positives, the negative guidance and high inventory levels will likely pressure the stock in the very near-term as investors digest the softer outlook.
