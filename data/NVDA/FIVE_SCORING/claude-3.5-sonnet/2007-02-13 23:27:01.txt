Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of NVIDIA's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Record quarterly revenue of $878.9M, up 39% YoY
- Strong gross margins at 44.2% (company high)
- Dominant position in graphics with GeForce 8 series
- Positive Vista catalyst potential
- Healthy guidance and pipeline

Key Concerns:
- Normal seasonal 5% revenue decline expected next quarter
- Memory revenue expected to decline
- Some channel inventory challenges
- Higher operating expenses from PortalPlayer acquisition
- Competitive pressures from AMD/ATI merger

Conclusion: The overall tone was positive with strong execution and market position, though tempered by near-term seasonal headwinds. The company appears well-positioned with its product lineup and growth initiatives, but may face some transitional pressures in the very near term. Given the mixed factors but generally solid fundamental picture, I expect a modestly positive short-term stock reaction.
