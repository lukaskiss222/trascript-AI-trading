Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for NVIDIA's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Re-gained performance leadership in graphics with GTX products
- Strong progress in new growth areas (Tesla, Tegra, Ion)
- Channel inventory reduced to healthy levels (1-1.5 months)
- Cost reduction initiatives targeting $35M quarterly OpEx savings

Key Concerns:
- Revenue down 46% QoQ and 60% YoY 
- Weak demand across all segments, particularly notebooks (-63%)
- High internal inventory levels requiring significant drawdown
- Limited near-term visibility beyond "flat to slightly up" guidance

Overall, while NVIDIA has promising long-term opportunities in new markets, the severe revenue decline, high inventory levels, and uncertain demand environment are likely to pressure the stock in the immediate term. Management's cautious tone and lack of clear catalysts for a near-term rebound suggest continued weakness.
