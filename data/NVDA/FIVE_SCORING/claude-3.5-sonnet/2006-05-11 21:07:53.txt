Based on my analysis of NVIDIA's earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term (1-2 week) impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong execution with record revenues of $681.8M (+17% YoY) and expanding gross margins to 42.5% (+650bps YoY), driven by successful ramp of high-margin GeForce 7 products.

2. Multiple growth catalysts ahead including Vista OS launch, high-definition video adoption, PlayStation 3 ramp, and increasing notebook/mobile GPU penetration.

3. Despite seasonally soft Q2 guidance, management expressed confidence in continued market share gains and gross margin sustainability, backed by strong product positioning and design wins.

While there are some near-term seasonal headwinds, the company's strong operational performance, expanding margins, and numerous growth drivers position it well for continued momentum. The overwhelmingly positive tone from management regarding their competitive position and growth outlook should support the stock price in the coming weeks.
