Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include: 38% sequential revenue growth, strong market share gains in desktop GPUs, successful cost reduction initiatives, healthy ION/TEGRA design win momentum, and management's confident tone about gross margin improvement. While there are some concerns around workstation segment weakness and aggressive pricing, the overall narrative suggests improving fundamentals and execution. The company appears well-positioned across multiple growth vectors (gaming, compute, mobile) with new products ramping.
