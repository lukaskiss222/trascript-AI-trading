Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with record quarterly revenue ($78.2M, up 75% YoY) and margins above target range at 46.2%, demonstrating robust execution and pricing power

2. Guidance for Q1 was better than seasonal expectations ($70-80M vs typical sharp Q1 decline), suggesting continued momentum

3. Strategic diversification into new growth markets (personal media displays, wireless) while maintaining leadership in core segments, with expectation of 10% revenue from new markets in 2006

The company appears well-positioned with strong execution, expanding markets, and healthy margins, though there is some concentration risk with 95% revenue from one customer.
