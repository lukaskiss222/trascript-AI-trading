Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong Financial Performance:
- Record Q4 revenue up 37% YoY to $1.2B
- Annual revenue up 34% to $4.1B
- High gross margins at 45.7%

2. Forward-Looking Guidance:
- Q1 expected to be "better than seasonal"
- Management expressed confidence in GPU market growth
- Strong ongoing demand for 8800 GT product line

3. Strategic Position:
- Clear leadership in GPU market
- Successful integration of acquisitions (AGEIA, Mental Images)
- Strong position in growing visual computing market

While there were some minor concerns (cost issues with 8800 GT), the overall tone was very positive with management expressing strong confidence in continued growth and market expansion.
