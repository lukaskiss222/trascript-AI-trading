Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. The company is experiencing extremely strong demand across product lines, with management indicating they were "several million units short" of meeting demand. This supply constraint rather than demand weakness is limiting growth.

2. Gross margins are healthy and stable, with multiple drivers including product mix improvements and the transition to newer manufacturing nodes.

3. Management expressed very high confidence about their next-generation FIRMY architecture and upcoming product cycles, suggesting strong competitive positioning.

4. Professional solutions business is showing signs of recovery which is positive for margins.

5. While supply constraints are a challenge, this indicates strong underlying demand and suggests upside potential as constraints ease.

The main risk is supply constraints limiting near-term revenue growth, but given the clear demand strength and management's confident tone, I believe the market will focus more on the positive fundamentals.
