Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Financial Performance:
- Record revenue of $687.5M, up 20% year-over-year
- Strong guidance of 8-10% revenue growth for next quarter
- ASP increases of 16% in desktop GPUs

2. Strategic Positioning:
- Will become the only independent GPU supplier supporting both Intel and AMD following AMD's acquisition of ATI
- Strong market share gains in notebooks (24% to 37%)
- Record revenues in professional/Quadro business

3. Forward-Looking Catalysts:
- Upcoming Vista launch expected to drive GPU demand
- PlayStation 3 royalties beginning next quarter
- Strong momentum in high-margin segments

The management team presented confidently and outlined multiple growth drivers, while the stock options review appears contained. The combination of strong current performance and positive forward catalysts suggests near-term stock appreciation.
