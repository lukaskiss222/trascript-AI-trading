Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerns include:

1. Significant supply constraints and yield issues with 28nm production affecting both revenue and margins
2. Q1 guidance below expectations due to hard drive shortages and 28nm constraints
3. Reduced full year outlook, particularly in Tegra business (50% growth vs previous higher targets)
4. Loss of Samsung as a major customer for Tegra

While there are some positives like strong design wins and market share gains expected, the near-term headwinds from production issues and reduced guidance will likely pressure the stock. Management's commentary suggests these challenges could persist through multiple quarters.
