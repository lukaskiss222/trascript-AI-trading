Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on NVIDIA's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong execution and improving fundamentals: The company reported improving yields on 40nm products, record Tesla revenues, and growing Quadro business approaching pre-recession levels. Gross margins are expanding and guided higher (46-47%) for next quarter.

2. New product momentum: Fermi GPU launches are seeing strong demand and the company is ramping production to meet pent-up demand in the high-end segment. Growth opportunities in mobile (Tegra), 3D Vision, and Tesla/Quadro segments also appear promising.

3. Management's confident tone and outlook: While guiding for seasonal decline in Q2, management expressed optimism about second half growth driven by Fermi ramp, enterprise recovery, and new mobile/tablet products.

The combination of improving execution, expanding margins, and multiple growth drivers should drive positive sentiment and stock appreciation over the next 1-2 weeks.
