NVIDIA reported a challenging quarter with revenue and earnings significantly below expectations, citing desktop GPU market weakness, pricing pressures from competitors, and delayed product ramps. Management's cautious tone and lack of clear guidance on when the situation might improve suggest ongoing short-term headwinds. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
