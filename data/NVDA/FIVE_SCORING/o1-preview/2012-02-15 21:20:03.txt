NVIDIA's Q4 results and Q1 outlook reveal short-term challenges. The company reported a 10.6% sequential revenue decline and provided lower Q1 revenue guidance due to continued hard disk drive shortages and 28nm yield issues impacting gross margins. While future growth drivers like Tegra 3 and Windows 8 are promising, the immediate concerns over supply constraints and margin pressures are likely to negatively affect the stock in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
