NVIDIA reported strong Q4 and full-year results with record revenues and improved gross margins, indicating robust performance across all segments. However, their guidance for Q1 anticipates a seasonal revenue decline of approximately 5%, and the company expressed caution despite enthusiasm for upcoming growth drivers like Vista and new product launches. This mix of positive results and cautious near-term outlook suggests a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
