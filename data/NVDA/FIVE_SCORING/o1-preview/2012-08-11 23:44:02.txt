NVIDIA reported strong quarterly results, exceeding expectations with a 13% sequential revenue increase driven by demand for its Kepler GPUs and Tegra processors. Positive guidance for the next quarter and management's confident tone suggest continued growth, despite some supply constraints and weakness in the professional segment. Overall, the strong performance and outlook are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
