NVIDIA delivered record Q2 results, significantly surpassing expectations with 36% revenue growth and record gross margins, driven by strong GPU sales in both desktop and notebook markets. Management's optimistic outlook, fueled by upcoming product launches like their first motherboard GPU for Intel processors, Hybrid SLI technology, and the Tesla line for high-performance computing, indicates continued momentum. Despite some concerns about capacity constraints, the strong performance and growth drivers suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
