NVIDIA reported strong Q3 results with record gross margins and solid growth in desktop and professional GPUs. The company's positive outlook on new product launches, increased design wins, and confidence in Tegra 3 adoption suggest potential for future growth, despite flat guidance for Q4 revenue. The emphasis on strategic investments and expansion into new markets indicates promising prospects, likely leading to a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
