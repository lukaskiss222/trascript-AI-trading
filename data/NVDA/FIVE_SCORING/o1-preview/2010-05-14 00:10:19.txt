NVIDIA reported strong demand for its new Fermi-based GPUs, leading to higher-than-expected gross margins and optimism about future growth in high-end graphics and Tegra divisions. While the company guided for a seasonal 3â€“5% revenue decline next quarter, management's positive tone and successful product launches suggest that the negatives may be offset. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term.
