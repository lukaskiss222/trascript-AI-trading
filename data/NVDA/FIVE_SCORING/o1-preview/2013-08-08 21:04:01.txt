NVIDIA's Q2 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong GPU performance and record gross margins, particularly in the gaming and professional visualization segments. While Tegra revenue declined more than anticipated, management projects significant growth in the coming quarters with the rollout of Tegra 4 devices and SHIELD. The company's positive guidance, strong balance sheet, and commitment to return over $1 billion to shareholders indicate a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
