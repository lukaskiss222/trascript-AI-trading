Continued partnerships with major customers like Apple, new design wins with SanDisk and Philips, and expansion into new markets indicate positive momentum. Despite slight concerns over seasonal revenue decline and customer concentration, the strong financial performance and optimistic outlook suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
