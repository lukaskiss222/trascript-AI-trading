NVIDIA reported strong financial results, exceeding guidance with record gross margins driven by high-margin gaming GPUs and enterprise products like Tesla and Quadro. While Tegra revenues declined due to the transition to Tegra 4 and Tegra 4i, the company expects growth in the second half with new product launches. The commitment to return over $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends further bolsters a positive short-term outlook.
