The third-quarter 2008 earnings call for JPMorgan Chase & Co. presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Challenging Earnings**: The company reported a significant decline in net income to $527 million, or $0.11 per share, largely due to markdowns on mortgage-related positions, leveraged loans, and higher credit costs[1].
2. **Washington Mutual Integration**: The acquisition of Washington Mutual added complexity, with a $1.2 billion conforming loan loss reserve adjustment and an extraordinary gain of $581 million. However, the integration is progressing well, with stabilizing deposit bases[1].
3. **Credit Costs and Reserves**: JPMorgan Chase increased credit reserves by $1.3 billion, bringing the total to $15.3 billion, and expects higher credit costs going forward due to worsening economic conditions[1].
4. **Capital Strength**: The company maintained strong Tier 1 capital at $112 billion and raised $11.5 billion of common equity during the quarter, which is a positive sign for its balance sheet strength[1].
5. **Government Support**: JPMorgan Chase is set to receive $25 billion in preferred equity from the government, which, while beneficial, comes with conditions and potential long-term implications for capital structure and cost[1].
6. **Business Segment Performance**: Mixed results across different business segments, with investment banking showing resilience, retail banking facing significant credit costs, and other segments like commercial banking and treasury services performing relatively well[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to:
- Lowered earnings expectations
- Increased credit costs and reserves
- Ongoing economic uncertainties

However, the strong capital position, successful integration of Washington Mutual, and government support could mitigate some of the negative impacts.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure but with some support from its strong capital position and government backing.

**Rating:**
