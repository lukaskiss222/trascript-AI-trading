### Challenges

### Outlook
- **Short-Term Outlook**: The firm expects the current environment in Markets to persist into the third quarter, with similar headwinds in Mortgage. They anticipate firm-wide adjusted expenses to be around $58 billion for the full year and expect credit trends to remain strong[3].
- **Long-Term Focus**: Despite short-term challenges, JPMorgan Chase is focused on long-term growth and efficiency. They emphasized their commitment to investing in key areas, managing expenses, and optimizing their balance sheet under new regulatory requirements[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to react positively in the short term due to the strong core performance, diversified earnings growth, and solid capital and liquidity position, despite some ongoing challenges.
