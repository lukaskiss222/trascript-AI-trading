Despite JPMorgan Chase reporting strong first-quarter 2024 earnings, with net income of $13.4 billion and EPS of $4.44, which exceeded analyst expectations, the stock price is likely to face short-term pressure for several reasons:

1. **Net Interest Income (NII) Shortfall**: NII came in below estimates, which is a significant driver of the bank's revenue. The drop from the record-breaking performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $23.2 billion in Q1 2024 was a disappointment[4].

2. **Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties**: CEO Jamie Dimon emphasized the bank's preparation for a range of economic scenarios, including higher interest rates, recession, and geopolitical tensions. This cautious outlook may dampen investor sentiment[2][4].

3. **Deposit Migration and Margin Compression**: The ongoing migration of deposits from checking and savings to CDs, along with deposit margin compression, is expected to continue, which could further impact NII[2][4].

4. **Expense Increases**: Higher compensation costs and the increase to the FDIC special assessment contributed to a rise in expenses, which could also affect profitability[2][4].

Given these factors, the stock may experience short-term volatility or a slight decline, despite the overall strong performance.

**Rating: -1**
