The earnings transcript for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the third quarter of 2012 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Record Net Income and Strong Performance**: The company reported record net income of $5.7 billion and strong performance across various business lines, including investment banking, consumer and business banking, and mortgage production. This positive financial performance is likely to support the stock price.

2. **Mortgage Market and Housing Trends**: The favorable mortgage origination environment, driven by low rates and the HARP program, contributed significantly to the company's results. However, there are indications that these high margins may not be sustainable as rates are expected to rise, which could slightly dampen future mortgage origination profits.

3. **Capital and Regulatory Environment**: JPMorgan Chase maintained strong capital ratios, including a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.4%, and discussed ongoing regulatory compliance and potential impacts from new Basel rules. The company's ability to manage regulatory requirements and maintain robust capital levels is a positive sign.

4. **Expense Management and Litigation Costs**: The company highlighted efforts to manage expenses and noted that litigation costs, while still significant, are being managed through reserves. This suggests a controlled approach to expense management.

5. **Fiscal Cliff and Economic Uncertainty**: There was discussion about preparing for the fiscal cliff and its potential impact on clients and the business. However, the executives did not indicate that this would significantly affect the company's immediate financial performance.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, robust capital positions, and a proactive approach to managing risks and expenses. However, there are some cautionary notes about future mortgage margins and ongoing litigation costs.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report and the company's solid position in various business segments.
