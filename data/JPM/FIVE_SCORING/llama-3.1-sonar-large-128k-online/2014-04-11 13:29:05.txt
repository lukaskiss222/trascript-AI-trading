JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2014 earnings call revealed several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Missed Earnings and Revenue Expectations**: The company reported net income of $5.3 billion and EPS of $1.28, which were below analyst expectations. Revenue was also down 8% year-over-year, driven by lower markets revenue and continued headwinds in mortgage[3].

- **Challenging Market Conditions**: The firm faced industry-wide headwinds in markets and mortgage, which affected revenue and profitability. However, underlying drivers across most businesses showed impressive trends, such as deposit growth, card sales volume, and record client investment assets[3].

- **Expense Management and Capital Plan**: Despite lower revenues, the company maintained expense discipline and was approved for its capital distribution plan, including a dividend increase and authorization to repurchase $6.5 billion of common equity. This suggests strong financial management and a commitment to returning value to shareholders[3].

- **Mortgage Business Challenges**: The mortgage business faced significant challenges, including lower production volumes and profitability issues. However, the company is working to rightsize capacity and reduce expenses, which could improve profitability in the long term[3].

- **Positive Outlook on Economy and Customer Trends**: Jamie Dimon expressed growing confidence in the economy, noting strong performance in consumer and commercial banking, and continued support for clients through credit and capital raising activities[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the missed earnings and revenue expectations, as well as the ongoing challenges in the mortgage and markets businesses. However, the strong underlying performance in other segments and the approval of the capital plan could mitigate some of this pressure.
