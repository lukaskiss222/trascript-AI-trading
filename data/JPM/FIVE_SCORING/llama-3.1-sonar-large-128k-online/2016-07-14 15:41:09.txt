The earnings call for JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the second quarter of 2016 presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported a net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55, and a return on tangible common equity of 13%, which are strong results given the market backdrop[3].
2. **Robust Loan and Deposit Growth**: The firm saw significant growth in core loans (up 16%) and record consumer deposit growth (up 10%), indicating strong demand and a solid consumer base[3].
3. **Brexit Impact**: While the Brexit vote introduced uncertainty, JPMorgan Chase's systems handled the volatility well, and the company is prepared to manage the long-term implications. However, this uncertainty might keep investors cautious in the short term[3].
4. **Positive Market Performance**: Markets revenue was up 23% year-on-year, driven by increased client trading activity and better performance in fixed-income and credit trading. This bodes well for the firm's ability to capitalize on market volatility[3].
5. **Credit Trends**: Wholesale credit trends were generally positive outside of the energy sector, and consumer credit performance was in line with expectations, though there was a slight increase in card delinquencies due to the seasoning of newer vintages[3].
6. **Expenses and Efficiency**: The firm made progress on its expense reduction commitments, with adjusted expenses down $140 million. This efficiency could continue to support profitability[3].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance, robust loan and deposit growth, and positive market performance are likely to be viewed positively by investors.
- The Brexit-related uncertainty, while managed well by the company, might introduce some short-term caution.
- The overall outlook, particularly with continued strong core business performance and efficient expense management, suggests a positive short-term impact.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong quarterly results and the company's ability to navigate market uncertainties.
