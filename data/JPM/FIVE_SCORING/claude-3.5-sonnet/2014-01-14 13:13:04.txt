Based on the extensive Q4 2013 earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Positive factors:
- Strong core business performance with $5.7B adjusted earnings
- Optimistic outlook on U.S. economy and loan growth potential
- Meeting capital ratio targets ahead of schedule
- Controlled expense management while investing in growth
- Conservative approach to risk/regulatory compliance

Negative factors:
- Continued pressure on trading revenues and spreads
- Mortgage production challenges expected to persist
- Some headwinds from regulatory changes and business exits
- Limited near-term capital return capacity
- Modest NII growth expectations despite potential loan growth

The overall tone was cautiously optimistic but pragmatic about near-term challenges. Management's confident but measured guidance suggests the stock should see a mildly positive reaction as investors appreciate the strong execution and positioning while factoring in the headwinds.
