Based on JPMorgan's Q2 2014 earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on the stock price. Key positives include: strong core earnings of $6 billion, solid loan growth at 4%, good cost control with expenses trending lower, continued progress on capital ratios, and a generally optimistic management tone about business conditions. While there are some headwinds in FICC trading and mortgages, the diversified business model is demonstrating resilience and most core businesses are performing well. The management team also conveyed confidence in managing through CEO Jamie Dimon's health situation.
