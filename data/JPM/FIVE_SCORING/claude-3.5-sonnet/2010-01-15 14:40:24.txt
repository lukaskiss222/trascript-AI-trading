Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for JPMorgan Chase's short-term stock outlook:

Key Positive Factors:
- Strong capital position with Tier 1 Common ratio at 8.8%
- Record full year revenues of $108.6B and pre-tax profits of $57B
- Early signs of economic recovery with credit card spend increasing and middle market loans stabilizing
- Investment banking pipeline improving with more M&A activity expected

Key Concerns:
- FICC trading revenues down significantly in Q4 due to lower volumes and spread compression
- Consumer credit costs remain elevated requiring additional $1.9B reserve build
- New regulatory costs and taxes likely (proposed "responsibility fee")
- Commercial real estate losses increasing in commercial banking segment

Conclusion:
While JPMorgan remains fundamentally strong, near-term headwinds from lower trading revenues, continued consumer credit costs, and regulatory uncertainty are likely to pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks. Management's cautious tone on several key business lines suggests modest downside risk to earnings expectations.
