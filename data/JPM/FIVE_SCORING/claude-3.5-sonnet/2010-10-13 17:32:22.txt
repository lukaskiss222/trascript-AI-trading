Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, I believe JPMorgan is well-positioned for positive short-term stock performance. Key positives include: strong capital position (easily meeting Basel III requirements), early signs of commercial loan growth, improving credit trends, controlled expenses, and management confidence in resuming dividends in Q1 2011. While there are headwinds from mortgage repurchase costs and foreclosure issues, these appear manageable and largely priced in. Management's confident yet measured tone and detailed command of the business suggests upside potential.
