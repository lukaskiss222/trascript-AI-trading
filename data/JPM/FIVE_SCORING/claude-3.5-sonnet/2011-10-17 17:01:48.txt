Based on this detailed earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong core business metrics (loan growth, deposit growth, market share gains)
- Conservative approach to reserves and capital management
- Solid risk management of European exposures
- Management's candid discussion of challenges and opportunities

Key Concerns:
- Guidance for Q4 IB revenues to remain weak like Q3
- Additional regulatory compliance costs of ~$500M coming
- Scaling back of growth initiatives (branches, etc.) due to fee impacts
- Cautious tone on capital return and business model changes needed
- Uncertainty around mortgage putbacks and litigation

The call painted a picture of a well-managed bank navigating significant headwinds. While core businesses are performing well, near-term challenges from weak markets, regulatory costs, and mortgage issues will likely weigh on the stock. Management's more cautious tone on capital return and growth investments may also pressure shares in the very short term.
