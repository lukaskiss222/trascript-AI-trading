Based on our analysis of the earnings transcript, we believe JPMorgan's stock will experience a slight negative impact over the next 1–2 weeks. The Richardson impact arises from the substitution of preferred dividend presentation across operating segments and newly announced elevated legal expenses, tempering otherwise strong performance and guidance. Legal expenses, totaling $1 billion after tax, dominate the conversation, though management assuages concerns by asserting that current reserves reflect their best estimate. While dispensable for shareholders, these expenses are an unavoidable burden in the short term. The revised Preferred dividend presentation lowers reported revenue and net income across business segments but has a neutral effect on overall Firm financials. This change, coupled with robust operating performance, could have propelled the stock higher, but the recently proposed strict capital requirements temper enthusiasm. Management strikes a confident tone regarding their ability to navigate the new regulations without drastic action, but the market may react skeptically in the short run. We anticipate a small dip in the stock price over the next 1–2 weeks.
