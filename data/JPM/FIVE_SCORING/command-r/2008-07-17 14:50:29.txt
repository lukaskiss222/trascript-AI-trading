JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed picture: investment banking performed well, but credit issues in prime mortgages and home equity 점에서s persist. Management's conservative approach to capital and dividends is reassuring, but the potential impact of FAS 140 changes and a troubled US housing market spook investors. Short-term pressures from the credit crunch and the integration of Bear Stearns appear in the results. The stock will likely consolidate in the near term.
