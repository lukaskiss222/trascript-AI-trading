JPMorgan's Q2 2014 earnings, while strong, present some mixed short-term signals. On the positive side, earnings-per-share beat expectations with significant growth in consumer banking and asset management. However, guidance for mortgage production indicates potential weakness, and legal expenses, although anticipated, were still significant. The stockâ€™s reaction will hinge on the market's valuation of the reported earnings against the backdrop of legal costs, mortgage business outlook, and ongoing regulatory concerns.
