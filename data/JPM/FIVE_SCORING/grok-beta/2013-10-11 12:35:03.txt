JPMorgan Chase reported a net loss of $380 million for Q3 2013, primarily due to an unprecedented $9.2 billion litigation expense stemming from mortgage-backed securities issues and other settlements. While the core business performance showed strength with market share gains, double-digit growth in key segments like deposits and asset management, the significant litigation reserve action indicates potential short-term concerns from investors regarding its future obligations and financial health. Despite the underlying growth, the stock might see selling pressure in the near term due to these uncertainties.
