JPMorgan Chase reported a strong performance relative to expectations, highlighted by reduced credit losses and reserve releases in its consumer businesses, which supports a mildly positive outlook for its short-term stock potential. However, the upcoming financial regulations (Dodd-Frank Act) and ongoing economic uncertainties pose risks that may dampen this impact slightly, potentially leading investors to take profits in the immediate future. 

Considering the positive earnings and management's focus on capital management through stock buybacks, along with their cautious stance on regulatory impacts, the short-term stock price impact is likely to be slightly positive.
