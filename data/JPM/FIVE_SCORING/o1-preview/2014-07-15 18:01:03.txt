JPMorgan Chase reported strong Q2 2014 results, with net income of $6 billion and a 14% return on tangible common equity, despite challenges in market conditions and mortgage banking. The bank demonstrated solid growth in key areas such as Consumer and Business Banking, Commercial Banking, and Asset Management, which offset weaker performance in mortgage and lower markets revenue. Managementâ€™s positive tone and emphasis on diversified earnings and continued investment suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
