JPMorgan Chase reported solid full-year results with record net income, strong capital ratios, and continued loan and deposit growth. Although investment banking revenues were down year-over-year and mortgage servicing costs remain elevated, improving credit trends and management's optimistic outlook, including potential for increased dividends and share buybacks, suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock. Therefore, the stock is likely to see a modest rise in the next couple of weeks.
