JPMorgan Chase reported strong full-year earnings with record net income and EPS, and management expressed confidence in navigating regulatory capital requirements while maintaining returns without restructuring the bank. Despite notable legal expenses and potential pressures from increased capital buffers, the bank showed solid performance across segments, and management's optimistic tone and commitment to expense management are likely to reassure investors. The stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
