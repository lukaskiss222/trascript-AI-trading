### Analysis

JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted a robust performance with record net income and EPS, driven by strong consumer and commercial banking results, as well as solid performance in the corporate and investment banking (CIB) segment. The company reported a 1% increase in total loans, with core loan growth of 5% excluding run-off. The call also saw the release of $650 million in mortgage reserves and $500 million in card reserves, which helped to boost net income.

However, the call also saw the company face challenges in the mortgage banking segment, with production pretax income down year-over-year and sequentially, driven by continued margin compression. The company also saw a modest increase in credit costs, which were partially offset by reserve releases.

The call also saw the company provide guidance for the year, projecting sales of $25.8 billion and EPS of $1.59.
