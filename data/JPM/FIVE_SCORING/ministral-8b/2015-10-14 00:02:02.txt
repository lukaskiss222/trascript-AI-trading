The earnings call from JPMorgan Chase & Co. for the third quarter of 2015 revealed a mixed performance with strong results in consumer and corporate banking, but weaker results in the investment banking and markets divisions. The company reported net income of $6.8 billion, EPS of $1.68, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, driven by strong consumer and corporate banking performance. The investment banking division saw outperformance in investment banking revenue and solid trading performance, but commercial banking revenue was down due to lower IB revenues in a declining market. The markets division saw mixed results, with fixed income revenue down 11% adjusted, but equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year. The company's balance sheet continued to improve, with CET1 ratios in line with each other at 11.4%, and the standardized ratio expected to be the floor from here. The company also reported progress against its capital targets, with net capital generation and a reduction in average assets driving improvements to both ratios. The company returned $2.7 billion of net capital to shareholders, including $1 billion of net repurchases and dividends of $0.44 a share. The company's GCIB surcharge was estimated to be in the 4% bucket, down from 4.5% at the beginning of the year. The company also reported progress on its expense reduction goals, with adjusted expenses down year over year in both the consumer and CIB businesses. The company's outlook for the fourth quarter was relatively flat, with adjusted expenses expected to be relatively flat to the third quarter, and core loan growth of 15% plus or minus expected to continue. The company also reported progress on its payment strategy, with plans to process more than $50 billion of Chase card volumes over ChaseNet in 2016.

The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
