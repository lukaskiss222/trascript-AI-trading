Based on the earnings transcript for JPMorgan Chase & Co., the short-term implications for the stock are:

1. **Positive Performance**: The company reported strong financial results, with net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76, and a return on tangible common equity of 13%. This indicates a solid performance and a healthy balance sheet.
2. **Growth in Key Areas**: Revenue grew 7% year-on-year, driven by net interest income and loan growth. This suggests that the company is well-positioned to benefit from a growing economy.
3. **Credit Quality**: The company maintained strong credit quality, with card and auto charge-offs in line with expectations. This indicates that the company is managing its credit risk effectively.
4. **Diversification**: The company's diversification across businesses and asset classes is a positive factor, as it reduces the risk of relying on a single source of revenue.
5. **Outlook**: The company's outlook for 2018 is broadly in line with previous guidance, with NII, expense, charge-off, and loan growth expected to remain stable. This suggests that the company is well-positioned to continue its strong performance in the coming quarters.
