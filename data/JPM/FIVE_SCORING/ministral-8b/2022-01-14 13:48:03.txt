Based on the earnings transcript for JPMorgan Chase & Co., the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the short term due to the company's guidance for 2022. The company expects to earn modestly below its 17% ROTCE target over the next one to two years, which could lead to a decline in the stock price. Additionally, the company's increased investment spend of $15 billion could also negatively impact the stock price. Therefore, the short-term outlook for the stock is negative.
