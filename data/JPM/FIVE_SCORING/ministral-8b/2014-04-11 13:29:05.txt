**Analysis:**

The earnings call for JPMorgan Chase & Co. provided a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong quarterly performance with $5.3 billion in net income and a return on tangible common equity of 13%. However, the results were tempered by lower market revenues and continued headwinds in mortgage. The outlook for 2014 remains challenging, with expectations of a negative mortgage production for the year. The company also mentioned potential impacts from regulatory changes, such as the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and leverage ratio, which could affect future performance. Overall, the call provided a mixed outlook for the company, with potential risks and opportunities in the coming quarters.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed outlook and the potential risks from regulatory changes and market conditions, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral. The company's strong performance in the quarter and the potential for long-term growth in certain areas may provide some support to the stock price. However, the challenges in the mortgage market and the uncertainty around regulatory changes could lead to short-term volatility. Therefore, the rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is:

**0**
