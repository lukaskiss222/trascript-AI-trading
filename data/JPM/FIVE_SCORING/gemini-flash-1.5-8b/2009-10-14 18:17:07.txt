JPMorgan's earnings call indicated continued strength in the investment bank and asset management, despite some pressure from credit card losses.  Management highlighted strong capital reserves and a cautious outlook on the economic recovery, citing concern over the longevity of the current stabilization in credit trends.  While the call suggests a short-term pressure for the stock related to the potential for further declines in credit, the call also emphasizes strong capital positions and the potential for the dividend to increase in the future.
