JPMorgan's earnings call highlights the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their first quarter performance.  While the core business performed well, substantial credit reserves were built, and investment banking revenues suffered from market volatility and delayed transactions.  Management projects a challenging second quarter and beyond, with potential for continued loan growth, but acknowledges the uncertainty in the economic outlook and the impact of government stimulus/forbearance programs, which could influence the eventual tally of future losses.
