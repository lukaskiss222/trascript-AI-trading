JPMorgan Chase's earnings call highlighted strong core performance despite significant one-time items, primarily legal expenses. Management emphasized the strength of underlying businesses, with adjusted earnings showing impressive growth.  Guidance for 2014 suggests stable net interest income, potentially slightly higher in the first half, with ongoing efforts to manage expenses.  The impact on the stock price will likely depend on investor reaction to the adjustments for FVA and DVA, and the ongoing management of significant legal expenses, but overall performance appears healthy.
