JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2018 earnings call highlighted strong overall performance, exceeding expectations in several key areas, particularly with solid loan growth and record client investment assets.  Management emphasized the positive impact of higher interest rates and tax reform but acknowledged some headwinds in certain areas of the investment bank, like debt and equity underwriting.  The call suggests a short-term positive impact on the stock, as strong results and positive guidance underpin a continued upward trajectory.
