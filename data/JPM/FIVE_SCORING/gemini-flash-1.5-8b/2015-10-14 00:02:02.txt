JPMorgan Chase's Q3 2015 earnings show a mixed outlook.  Strong performance in consumer banking, with loan growth and deposit gains, and an outperformance in investment banking revenue, contrasts with a decline in commercial banking revenue, and lower market levels impacting asset management.  Management highlights tax benefits and legal expense and  a significant reserve release in consumer, potentially signaling reduced short-term risk.  The overall positive impact is neutral as they expect relatively flat growth in NII/NIM in Q4 amid interest rate uncertainty.
