JPMorgan's earnings call highlights a stabilization in the balance sheet and a cautious optimism for the short term.  While the Investment Bank saw strong revenue in the first several weeks of January, management pointed to mixed signals regarding economic recovery, with some positive signs but also continued uncertainty concerning the impact of government programs on specific asset classes.  The near-term outlook appears to be focused on managing existing risks rather than significant expansion,  with a focus on capital efficiency and prudent lending.
