JPMorgan's earnings call highlighted strong second-quarter performance, excellent capital strength, and a cautious outlook on the near-term mortgage market.  Management emphasized the positive impact of rising interest rates on net interest income in the long term, but noted a temporary reduction in unrealized gains in the securities portfolio.  The call's focus on capital adequacy, and management's willingness to potentially adjust business strategy to address the new regulatory environment suggests limited near-term positive price movement.
