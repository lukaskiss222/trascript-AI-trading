JPMorgan's earnings call highlights concerns about the Basel III endgame proposal, which management views as excessively increasing capital requirements.  The proposed regulatory changes are predicted to significantly impact market lending, potentially limiting credit availability and increasing pricing, therefore impacting the company's long-term return profile.  While the call expressed a cautious outlook for the overall economy, management's focus on maintaining strong customer relationships and adapting to the changing regulatory landscape suggests a proactive approach to navigate these challenges.
