JPMorgan's Q1 2012 earnings call indicates strong performance across various business segments, particularly in the Investment Bank.  Management emphasizes underlying fundamental growth in many areas, with significant improvements in mortgage banking and loan growth.  However,  concerns exist around the potential for ongoing margin pressure from low interest rates, and the need to carefully manage asset/liability mismatches, but this is a known, well-managed factor that will likely have some normal quarterly and annual fluctuations.
