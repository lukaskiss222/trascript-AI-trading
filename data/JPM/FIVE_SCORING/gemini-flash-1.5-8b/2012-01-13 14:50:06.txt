JPMorgan Chase's earnings call highlighted strong loan growth across various segments, particularly in small business and trade finance.  However, investment banking revenue was down, primarily due to lower market volumes and a $570 million DVA loss.  Management anticipates continued loan growth, but with downward pressure on net interest margins in 2012, offset by strong deposit growth.  The call indicates a cautious but optimistic outlook for the short term, with a focus on managing expenses and navigating challenging market conditions.
