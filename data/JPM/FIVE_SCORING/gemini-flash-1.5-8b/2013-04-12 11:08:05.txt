JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted strong performance with record net income and EPS.  Management emphasized positive trends in credit quality and loan growth, particularly in commercial real estate. However, challenges in net interest income and mortgage banking margins were discussed, suggesting the impact of low interest rates and competitive pressures.  Overall, the call suggests a short-term pause in stock price growth until those factors improve.
