JPMorgan's earnings were impacted by a challenging capital markets environment, resulting in lower Investment Bank fees and a decrease in fixed-income revenue.  However, strong growth in consumer and business banking, including small business loans, trade finance, and deposits, offset some of those losses. Management emphasized a cautious outlook for the fourth quarter, reflecting persisting market volatility.  The likely short-term impact is a somewhat muted reaction, possibly a slight pullback due to the uncertainty around the fourth quarter and longer term investment bank performance.
