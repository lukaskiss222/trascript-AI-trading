JPMorgan's Q1 2022 earnings show resilience in a volatile market.  While some areas like Investment Banking and Equity underwriting experienced declines, the overall performance was positive, driven by continued loan growth, deposit increases, and robust consumer spending.  Management highlighted prudent reserve building, which reflects a proactive approach to potential risks, though it may limit short-term profit margins. The outlook for NII suggests potential growth, but management is not providing specific short-term projections, and will detail this further at Investor Day.
