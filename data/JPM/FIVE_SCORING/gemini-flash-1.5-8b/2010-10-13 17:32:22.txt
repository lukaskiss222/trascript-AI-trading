JPMorgan's earnings call highlights a continued, yet cautiously optimistic, outlook.  While the company shows solid performance in some segments (investment bank, asset management), pressure remains in others (retail and especially mortgage banking).  The management team's discussion points to ongoing uncertainties in the mortgage market and the potential impact of the new rules on long-term revenue streams. These factors suggest a somewhat neutral to slightly negative short-term stock price impact during the coming 1â€“2 weeks.
