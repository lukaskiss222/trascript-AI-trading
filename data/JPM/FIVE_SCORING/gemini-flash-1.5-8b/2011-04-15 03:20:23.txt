JPMorgan Chase's Q1 2011 earnings call highlights strong performance across many key divisions, particularly the Investment Bank, with record debt underwriting fees and solid market share gains.  Improved credit quality, reflected in lower credit card loss provisions, is a positive factor.  However, considerations such as potential MSR adjustments, foreclosure and legal costs, and a higher-than-expected compensation ratio for the Investment Bank should be noted. The outlook suggests potential modest pressure on the Net Interest Margin (NIM) in the coming quarter.
