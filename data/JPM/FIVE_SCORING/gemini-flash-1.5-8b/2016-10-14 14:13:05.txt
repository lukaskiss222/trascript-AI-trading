JPMorgan Chase's Q3 2016 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations across several key metrics.  Management highlighted robust loan growth, strong core deposit growth, and record performance in investment banking. While some expenses increased due to specific factors, the net income was still favorable.  The short-term implications are likely positive, with the stock potentially rallying on the broad positive news from the quarter if investor sentiment remains optimistic in the forthcoming weeks.
