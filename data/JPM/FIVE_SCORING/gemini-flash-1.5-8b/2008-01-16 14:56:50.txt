JPMorgan Chase's earnings call highlights significant credit concerns across consumer segments, particularly in home equity and subprime mortgages, driven by declining home values and rising delinquencies.  While the company maintained strong capital ratios and added substantial reserves, management acknowledges potential for further credit losses in the near term.  The company's overall strong performance in other areas (commercial and asset management) and focus on prudent capital allocation, coupled with their aggressive growth strategy, suggest a short-term negative impact, but with potential for resilience.
