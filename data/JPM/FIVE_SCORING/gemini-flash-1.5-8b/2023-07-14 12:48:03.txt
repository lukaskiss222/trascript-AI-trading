JPMorgan's earnings call highlights robust Q2 results, significantly boosted by the First Republic acquisition.  While management emphasizes the integration's positive impact, they also acknowledge uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic outlook, deposit repricing, and the potential impact of upcoming regulatory changes.  The upward NII revision is tempered by the expectation of a substantial return to a more moderate run-rate in future quarters. This suggests a likely short-term stock price rally on strong Q2 performance but tempered by the long-term outlook's uncertainty.
