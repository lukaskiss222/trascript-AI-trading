JPMorgan's earnings call highlights strong performance in Investment Banking and Asset & Wealth Management, particularly in M&A and advisory, offset by some normalization in Markets.  Management projects modest NII growth in 2022 but anticipates sub-target returns in the near term due to rate normalization and continued investments.  The focus on significant technology investments, including cloud migration, suggests a long-term strategy to improve efficiency and potentially generate future revenue, but this likely won't translate to notable stock price movement during the next two weeks.
