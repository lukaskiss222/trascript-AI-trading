The Sherwin-Williams Company's earnings transcript reveals a challenging year ahead, with continued weak demand in the U.S. housing market. While cost-cutting measures and branded marketing grew awareness, management's conservative stance on the U.S. economy and expectations of flat sales in 2008 indicate short-term difficulties. The stock will likely face pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks due to these challenges, offsetting any positive impact from cost savings and international growth.
