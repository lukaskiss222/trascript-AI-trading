The Sherwin-Williams Company's earnings call reveals its strategic acquisitions, efficient cost management, and controlled distribution network yielded record sales and earnings. The company's outlook for the fourth quarter and 2008 remains optimistic despite DIY market softness and increasing raw material costs. The management's confidence in sustaining profitability and margin expansion is notable. However, the upcoming year's challenges and the dilute effect of recent acquisitions on short-term earnings per share warrant caution. The stock is likely to consolidate in the short term.
