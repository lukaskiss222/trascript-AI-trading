The earnings transcript for The Sherwin-Williams Company (though the transcript appears to be for Valspar, which is now part of Sherwin-Williams) reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Mixed Performance and Guidance**: The company reported strong sales and earnings growth for the fourth quarter and full year 2011, but the outlook for 2012 is more cautious, with modest sales growth expected and ongoing challenges from raw material costs and soft markets in North America and Europe.

2. **Impairment Charge**: A significant non-cash impairment charge of $363.4 million related to the wood coatings and gelcoat product lines could initially impact investor sentiment negatively, although it does not affect liquidity or bank credit covenants.

3. **Raw Material Costs and Pricing**: The company faced significant raw material inflation in 2011 but managed to recover about 85-90% of these costs through pricing actions. However, there is still a gap to be recovered, and the company expects mid-single digit raw material inflation in 2012.

4. **Operational Performance**: Despite challenges, the company has made progress in restoring margins through pricing and productivity improvements. The restructuring efforts and cost savings are expected to continue benefiting the company in 2012.

5. **Market and Segment Performance**: The paint segment saw soft volumes in the US, while the coatings segment performed better due to new business and pricing. Growth in Asia and Latin America is expected to be stronger than in the US and Europe.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be:

- **Neutral to Slightly Positive**: The company's ability to deliver double-digit earnings growth despite challenging market conditions and raw material inflation is positive. However, the impairment charge and cautious outlook for 2012 might temper immediate enthusiasm.

**Rating: 0**
