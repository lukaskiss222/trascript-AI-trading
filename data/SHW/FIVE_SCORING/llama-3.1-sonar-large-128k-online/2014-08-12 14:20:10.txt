The transcript for Valspar's (now part of Sherwin-Williams) fiscal 2014 third quarter results indicates several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Positive Signals:**
  - The company reported a 10% increase in net sales and a 13% increase in adjusted EPS, driven by successful integration of acquisitions, strong performance in China and Europe, and improved sales and profitability in the Coatings segment[4|.
  - The Paints segment showed strong volume growth, especially in international markets like China and Australia, despite some challenges in the U.S. market due to pre-shipments in Q2[4|.
  - The company updated its annual fiscal 2014 sales guidance to approximately 9% growth and adjusted EPS guidance to $4.05 to $4.15 per share, which is at the high end of their previous range[4|.
  - Positive reception of new products, such as Valspar Reserve, and strong execution in new retail initiatives were highlighted[4].

- **Mixed Signals:**
  - The Paints segment EBIT declined due to increased investments in advertising and marketing, which may concern some investors despite the long-term growth potential[4|.
  - Higher operating expenses, including variable incentive compensation and costs associated with new business initiatives, could impact short-term profitability[4|.
  - Inventory and working capital increases due to new product launches and acquisitions might raise concerns about cash flow management, although the company expects normalized behavior by the end of the year[4!.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong sales growth, successful product launches, and optimistic guidance. However, the increased expenses and temporary cash flow impacts might temper some of the enthusiasm.
