The Sherwin-Williams Company's second-quarter 2009 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a mixed but generally cautious outlook for the short term:

- **Revenue and Sales**: Consolidated net sales decreased by 12.6% due to weak paint sales volume and unfavorable currency translation rates. This trend is expected to continue, with guidance indicating a 10% to 13% decline in the third quarter and an 11% to 12.5% decline for the full year 2009[1>.
- **Margins and Costs**: Despite the sales decline, gross margins improved to 46.0% from 43.6% in the same period last year, and SG&A expenses decreased by $24 million. However, these improvements are somewhat offset by the overall decline in sales[1].
- **Guidance**: The company anticipates a challenging second half of 2009, with no significant recovery expected until 2010. The guidance for diluted net income per common share is in the range of $3.30 to $3.80 for the full year 2009, which is lower than the previous year[1>.
- **Economic Environment**: The company is facing a tough economic environment with significant declines in commercial and residential construction, which are key segments for their business. The recovery is expected to be slow once it begins[1].

Given these points:

- The revenue declines and cautious guidance suggest continuing challenges in the short term.
- The improvements in margins and cost management are positive but may not fully offset the sales declines.
- The overall economic environment remains weak, which could impact investor sentiment.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, ongoing sales declines, and the challenging economic environment.
