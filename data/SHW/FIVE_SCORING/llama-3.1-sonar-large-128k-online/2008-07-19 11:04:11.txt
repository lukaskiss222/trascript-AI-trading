The Sherwin-Williams Company's second-quarter 2008 earnings call revealed several key points that impact the short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Challenging Market Conditions**: The company is navigating significant challenges, including a deteriorating domestic housing market, rising raw material costs, and a weakening domestic economy. These factors have led to lower sales volumes and increased costs[3/.

2. **Financial Performance**: Despite these challenges, the company reported a slight increase in consolidated net sales, largely due to strong sales by the Global Group and acquisitions. However, gross profit and net income decreased due to impairment charges, lower sales, and margin pressures from higher input and freight costs[3/.

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, expecting slightly lower sales and earnings compared to 2007. The outlook for the third quarter is for consolidated net sales to be down slightly, with diluted net income per share expected in the range of $1.20 to $1.45 per share[3/.

4. **Price Increases and Raw Material Costs**: The company announced additional high-single-digit price increases to offset rising raw material costs, which are expected to continue increasing in the second half of the year[3/.

5. **Operational Efficiencies**: Despite the challenges, the company has managed to control SG&A expenses and maintain operational efficiencies, which has helped offset some of the inflationary pressures[3/.

Given these points:

- The immediate financial performance is impacted by challenging market conditions and higher raw material costs.
- The company's ability to manage costs and implement price increases to offset these costs is a positive.
- However, the overall guidance for the rest of the year indicates continued pressure on sales and earnings.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, ongoing market challenges, and the need for further price increases to offset raw material costs. However, the company's efforts in cost management and its ability to implement price increases suggest some resilience.
