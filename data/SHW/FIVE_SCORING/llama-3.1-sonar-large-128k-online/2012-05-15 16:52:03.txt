The transcript for The Sherwin-Williams Company's second quarter 2012 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock's performance in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported a 31% increase in earnings per share, driven by excellent execution on key initiatives, including pricing actions, productivity improvements, and the exit of unprofitable product lines and customers. This strong financial performance is likely to be positively received by investors[2].

2. **Margin Improvement**: Significant improvements in EBIT margins in both the Coatings and Paint segments, driven by better price-cost balance, productivity gains, and the exit of unprofitable businesses, suggest sustained profitability. This is a positive indicator for future performance[2].

3. **Volume Trends**: Despite some volume challenges, particularly in the coatings segment due to the exit of unprofitable businesses, the company expects sequential volume improvement to continue in the back half of the year. This trend, combined with easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half, suggests potential for positive volume growth[2].

4. **Guidance Increase**: The company raised its full-year guidance to $3.20 to $3.30 per share, reflecting confidence in continued execution of growth and productivity initiatives. This increased guidance is likely to be viewed positively by investors[2].

5. **Geographic and Market Strength**: Strong performance in China, particularly in the affordable housing market, and positive trends in other segments such as pipeline and seaborne containers, add to the overall positive outlook[2].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, improved margins, and increased guidance.
