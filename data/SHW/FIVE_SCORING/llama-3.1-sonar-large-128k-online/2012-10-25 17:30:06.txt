The Sherwin-Williams Company's third-quarter 2012 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported a 4.8% increase in consolidated net sales, a 240-basis-point increase in gross margin, and a 31% increase in diluted net income per share. These metrics are generally positive and indicate robust financial health[4].

2. **Market Share Gains**: Sherwin-Williams continues to gain market share, particularly in the architectural paint segment, driven by strong performance in the Paint Stores group and residential repaint markets. This is a positive indicator of the company's competitive strength[4].

3. **Raw Material Cost Trends**: The moderation in raw material costs, especially titanium dioxide and propylene, is expected to continue, which could support higher gross margins in the future. However, the company does not anticipate significant inventory adjustments based on these cost trends[4].

4. **Caution on Growth**: While the company is optimistic about the U.S. residential market, there is some caution regarding overall growth due to international market softness and the impact of foreign currency translation. However, this caution is not overly pessimistic, and the company remains positive about its long-term outlook[4].

5. **Store Expansion and Acquisitions**: Sherwin-Williams plans to continue its store expansion strategy, aiming to add 60 to 65 new store locations in 2012, and is open to acquisitions that fit its strategic targets. This indicates ongoing investment in growth initiatives[4%.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, market share gains, and a favorable outlook on raw material costs. However, there are some cautionary notes on international market conditions and the impact of currency translation.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, market share gains, and favorable trends in raw material costs. The company's cautious stance on overall growth and international markets may temper some of the enthusiasm but is not expected to significantly dampen the positive sentiment.
