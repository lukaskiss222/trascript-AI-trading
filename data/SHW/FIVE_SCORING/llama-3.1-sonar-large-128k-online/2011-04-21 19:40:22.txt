The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q1 2011 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Aspects:
- **Strong Earnings Growth**: The company reported a significant increase in diluted net income per share, up more than 57% compared to the same period last year, driven by higher selling prices, acquisitions, and favorable currency translation[1|.
- **Market Share and Volume**: Despite flat volumes in the Paint Stores Group, the company is gaining market share, particularly in the DIY segment, and seeing growth in protective and marine coatings[1|.
- **Capital Allocation**: Sherwin-Williams continued to execute its capital allocation strategy with share repurchases and a dividend increase, which can be positively viewed by investors[1|.
- **Guidance**: The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, indicating confidence in its ability to manage through raw material cost increases and other challenges[1].

### Challenges:
- **Raw Material Costs**: The rapid increase in raw material costs, particularly titanium dioxide, is expected to continue and could negatively impact gross margins in the short term. The company anticipates mid-teen percent increases in raw material costs, which could be a significant earnings headwind[1|.
- **Acquisition Integration**: While acquisitions contributed significantly to revenue, their impact on gross margins was negative. The integration process, though progressing, may take longer to yield full margin benefits[1|.
- **Volume Growth**: Core volume growth was only slightly positive, and the company remains cautious about domestic market demand for the remainder of the year due to continued declines in new construction and non-residential repaint segments[1].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong earnings growth, positive guidance, and ongoing efforts to manage cost pressures, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. However, the challenges related to raw material costs and the cautious outlook on volume growth might temper some of the enthusiasm.
