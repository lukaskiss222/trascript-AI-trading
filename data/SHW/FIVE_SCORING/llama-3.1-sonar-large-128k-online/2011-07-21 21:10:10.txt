The Sherwin-Williams Company's second-quarter 2011 earnings call presented a mixed picture that is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Sales and Revenue**: Consolidated net sales increased by 9.9%, driven by selling price increases, acquisitions, and favorable currency translation. However, this growth was partially offset by challenges such as the loss of a significant paint program with a large retail customer and softer demand in the architectural coatings market[6}.
  
- **Margins and Costs**: Gross margins declined by 200 basis points due to higher raw material costs, particularly titanium dioxide, which were only partially offset by price increases. This margin pressure is expected to continue in the short term.

- **Guidance**: The company updated its full-year guidance, expecting diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.85, which is a slight increase but still reflects caution due to ongoing raw material cost pressures.

- **Raw Material Costs**: The persistent and significant increases in raw material costs, especially titanium dioxide, remain a major headwind. The company has taken multiple price increases but faces a delay in fully implementing these increases, which affects their ability to offset the cost increases immediately.

- **Segment Performance**: The Paint Stores Group saw a modest increase in sales but a decline in segment profit due to raw material costs. The Consumer Group experienced a more significant decline in sales and profit, while the Global Finishes Group showed strong growth driven by acquisitions and favorable currency rates.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience neutral to slightly negative pressure in the short term due to the margin squeeze from raw material costs and the cautious outlook despite overall sales growth.
