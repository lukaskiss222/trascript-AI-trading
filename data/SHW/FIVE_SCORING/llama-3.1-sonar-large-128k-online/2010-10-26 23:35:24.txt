The earnings transcript for The Sherwin-Williams Company reveals several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: While the company reported solid revenue and volume growth, driven by acquisitions, price increases, and favorable currency translation, the gross margin decreased due to higher raw material costs, particularly titanium dioxide. This margin compression is expected to continue into the fourth quarter.

2. **Raw Material Pressures**: The persistent and rising costs of raw materials, especially titanium dioxide, are a significant concern. The company anticipates continued pressure on margins until they can fully implement price increases to offset these costs.

3. **Acquisition Dilution**: The recent acquisitions, such as Becker Acroma and Sayerlack, have diluted earnings in the third quarter and are expected to do so in the fourth quarter as well, although the company anticipates these acquisitions will become accretive starting in the second quarter of 2021.

4. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company's guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of mid-teens percentage sales growth and diluted net income per common share in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 for the fourth quarter. However, the ongoing challenges in raw material costs and SG&A expenses may continue to weigh on margins.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the margin compression, ongoing raw material cost pressures, and the dilutive effects of recent acquisitions. However, the company's overall revenue growth and strategic efforts to manage these challenges suggest that the impact might not be severely negative.
