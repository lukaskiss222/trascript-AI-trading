The transcript for The Sherwin-Williams Company's third quarter 2011 financial results and expectations presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Sales Growth**: The company reported a 14.4% increase in consolidated net sales, driven by selling price increases, acquisitions, and improved organic volume growth, particularly in the Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group[4].
- **Margin Improvement Expectations**: Despite current margin pressures due to raw material costs, management expects gross margins to improve in the fourth quarter and anticipates being in the lower half of their guided range of 43% to 46% by year-end[4].
- **Volume Growth**: The company saw solid organic volume growth, especially in the residential repaint market, and expects this trend to continue[4].
- **Share Gains**: Sherwin-Williams has been gaining market share, particularly among professional painting contractors, due to its strong store footprint and service[4].

### Negative Factors:
- **Raw Material Costs**: The company is facing significant pressure from rising raw material costs, particularly titanium dioxide, which is expected to continue into 2012. This has impacted gross margins and will likely require further price increases[4].
- **IRS Settlement**: A one-time charge of $75 million related to an IRS settlement will affect the fourth quarter earnings, though it is a one-time event[4].
- **Margin Pressure**: While the company expects some improvement in margins, the current quarter's margins were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and production issues, which could continue to affect investor sentiment in the short term[4].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility. However, the overall positive trends in sales growth, volume improvement, and expected margin recovery suggest that the negative impacts may be temporary.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see minimal negative impact in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains positive due to the company's strategic investments and market share gains.
