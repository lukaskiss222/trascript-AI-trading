The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q2 2010 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Sales Growth**: Despite some moderation in the second half, the company reported a 10% increase in consolidated net sales, driven by improved architectural sales, acquisitions, and favorable foreign currency translation. This strong sales growth is a positive indicator[1].

2. **Margin Pressure and Cost Control**: The company faced gross margin compression due to rising raw material costs, but effectively managed SG&A expenses, which decreased as a percentage of sales. This cost control is a positive sign, though the ongoing raw material cost pressures may continue to impact margins in the near term[1].

3. **Acquisitions and Expansion**: Sherwin-Williams made significant acquisitions, such as the Arch Chemicalâ€™s Industrial Wood Coatings business and the planned acquisition of Becker Acroma, which are expected to contribute positively to future growth[1].

4. **Guidance and Expectations**: The company maintained its full-year guidance for sales and EPS, indicating confidence in their ability to manage through current market conditions. However, there is a slight moderation expected in the second half, primarily due to the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit and broader economic factors[1].

5. **Financial Health**: The company demonstrated solid financial health with increased net income, a strong cash flow generation, and a commitment to share repurchases and dividend increases[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong sales growth, effective cost management, and strategic expansions. However, the moderation in sales growth and ongoing raw material cost pressures could temper some of the enthusiasm.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong sales performance, effective cost control, and strategic growth initiatives, despite some minor headwinds from raw material costs and economic uncertainties.
