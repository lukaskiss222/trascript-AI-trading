The Sherwin-Williams Company's third-quarter earnings call presents a mixed outlook that is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks). Here are the key points:

### Positive Aspects
- The company reported a 7.2% increase in sales, driven by acquisitions and currency, although core growth was only 0.6%.
- International operations, particularly the Huarun business in China, performed well with high double-digit sales growth.
- The packaging coatings business showed high single-digit organic growth, which is relatively immune to economic cycles.
- The company maintained its full-year earnings guidance and expects to generate significant free cash flow.

### Negative Aspects
- The U.S. architectural and wood coatings businesses continued to face significant pressure due to the soft housing market, with volumes down in the mid-single digits.
- Gross margins declined due to higher raw material costs, which have increased more rapidly than anticipated (9% to 14% year-over-year), and the lag in pricing actions.
- The company announced restructuring charges that will impact earnings in the fourth quarter and into 2009, although savings are expected to offset costs by 2010.
- The overall economic environment, particularly in the U.S., remains challenging, with no clear indication of a bottom in the housing market.

Given these factors, the stock is unlikely to see significant upward momentum in the short term due to the ongoing challenges in the U.S. housing market and the impact of raw material inflation. However, the strong performance in international markets and the packaging segment, along with the company's efforts to manage costs and improve efficiency, may prevent a significant decline.
