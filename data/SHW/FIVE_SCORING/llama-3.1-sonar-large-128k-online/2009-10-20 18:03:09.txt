The transcript for Sherwin-Williams' third quarter 2009 earnings call highlights several key points that suggest a mixed but generally challenging outlook for the short term:

1. **Sales Decline**: Consolidated net sales decreased by 12% due to weak paint sales volumes across all categories, and the company expects sales to be down 8-12% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year[3|.
2. **Profit Margins**: While gross margins improved due to lower raw material costs and better expense control, segment profits were impacted by lower sales volumes and unfavorable operating efficiencies[2|.
3. **Market Conditions**: The company faces significant headwinds in the commercial and new construction markets, which are expected to continue into 2010. Residential repaint and DIY channels showed some sequential improvement but are not yet indicative of a broader recovery[3|.
4. **Raw Material Costs**: There is a potential for raw material costs to rise in the future, which could pose a challenge, although the company has historically managed to offset such increases through internal cost reductions and pricing adjustments[3|.
5. **Share Repurchases and Financial Health**: The company has maintained strong financial discipline, including reducing debt and continuing share repurchases, but the overall economic environment remains challenging[3!.

Given these points, the short-term outlook for Sherwin-Williams' stock is likely to be negative due to the ongoing sales decline, continued pressure from weak market conditions, and potential increases in raw material costs.
