The transcript for Valspar's (now part of Sherwin-Williams) fiscal 2013 second quarter earnings call presents a mixed picture but with several positive indicators for the short term.

### Key Points:
- **Volume Growth**: The company reported strong volume growth of 7%, driven by new business wins, particularly in the Paints segment in North America, including the Ace private label business and the Professional Paint program at Lowe's[4].
- **Segment Performance**: Despite some challenges in the general industrial segment, the company saw improvements in packaging, wood, and coil coatings. EBIT margins improved in the Paints segment but declined in the Coatings segment due to mix shifts and lower sales in some industrial product lines[4].
- **Guidance**: Valspar maintained its adjusted EPS guidance for the full year, indicating confidence in their ability to manage through current market conditions and achieve their growth targets[4].
- **Restructuring and Cost Savings**: The company announced restructuring initiatives aimed at improving efficiency and reducing costs, which are expected to improve annual EPS by approximately $0.10 when fully realized in fiscal 2015[4].
- **Market Outlook**: Management expressed optimism about the long-term prospects, particularly in high-growth markets like China, Latin America, and Europe, despite current softness in some segments[4].

### Short-Term Implications:
Given the strong volume growth, continued investment in profitable new business, and the maintenance of EPS guidance, the stock is likely to see a positive reaction in the short term. The restructuring efforts and cost-saving measures also suggest a focus on long-term profitability, which could further support the stock.

### Conclusion:
The positive volume growth, maintained guidance, and strategic initiatives to improve profitability suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
