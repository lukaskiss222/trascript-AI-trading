The transcript for Valspar's fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call presents a mixed outlook for the short term, but here are the key points that influence the stock's potential movement:

1. **Strong 2014 Performance**: Valspar reported a record year in sales and earnings, driven by volume growth in the Coatings segment and significant gains in international regions.

2. **North American Business Loss**: The company lost a significant piece of business in North America, which is expected to impact sales and earnings in 2015. However, management is confident in their ability to manage this loss and maintain overall growth.

3. **Positive Outlook for 2015**: Despite the loss in North America, Valspar expects continued growth in other regions such as China, Australia, and Europe. The company also anticipates benefits from new business wins and the integration of recent acquisitions.

4. **Cost Management and Productivity**: Valspar plans to implement cost reduction programs and leverage productivity initiatives to mitigate the impact of the lost business and maintain strong margins.

5. **Raw Material Environment**: The company expects a relatively benign raw material environment, which should not significantly impact their margins.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The strong performance in 2014 and the confidence in managing the lost business while continuing to grow in other areas suggest that the stock might not experience significant downward pressure. However, the immediate reaction could be muted due to the loss of a significant North American business.

**Rating: 0**
