Sherwin-Williams' Q1 earnings call indicates a positive outlook despite global market headwinds.  Strong pricing and productivity improvements in the coatings segment, along with new business initiatives, are offsetting concerns about volume weakness in some areas.  Management is cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, raising guidance and citing anticipated raw material cost increases.  This suggests short-term volatility with potential for continued stock price appreciation.
