Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlighted strong fourth-quarter results, driven by increased volume in Paint Stores and the HGTV Home program.  Management expressed confidence in the company's strategy and projected low-single-digit sales and earnings growth for 2016, despite some headwinds from currency fluctuations and a potential slowdown in the oil and gas sector.  The cautious guidance, although based on favorable factors like declining raw materials, suggests the company is taking a slightly more conservative approach to predicting future growth.
