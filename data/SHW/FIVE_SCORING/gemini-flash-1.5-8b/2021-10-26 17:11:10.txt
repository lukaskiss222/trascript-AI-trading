Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlighted continued robust demand but substantial raw material headwinds.  Management emphasized pricing actions to mitigate inflation, but acknowledged that margin pressure would persist in the short term.  While the company is confident in long-term growth and anticipates a mid to high single-digit sales increase in Q4, the impacts of raw materials and the normalization of the DIY sector will likely impact the stock price in the next two weeks.
