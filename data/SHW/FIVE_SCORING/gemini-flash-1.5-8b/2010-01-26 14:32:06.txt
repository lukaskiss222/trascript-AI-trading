Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlights a cautious but slightly optimistic outlook for 2010.  While sales are projected to increase modestly in the low to mid-single digits, management notes ongoing weakness in commercial markets.  The company's focus on cost-cutting and improved cash flow, along with a potential uptick in residential markets, suggests a relatively positive near-term outlook, at least compared to the severe downturn of 2009.
