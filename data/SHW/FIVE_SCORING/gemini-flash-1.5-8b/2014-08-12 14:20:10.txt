Valspar's Q3 earnings call highlighted strong performance across most product lines, particularly in Coatings and international markets.  Management cited successful integrations and new initiatives like the Valspar Reserve launch, but also acknowledged higher-than-expected spending in Paints, temporarily impacting EBIT.  The updated guidance for fiscal 2014 reflects continued growth optimism, indicating a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price as investors assess the company's execution and resilience against market headwinds.
