Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlights continued strong performance, particularly in the Americas Group.  Management expressed optimism regarding architectural demand and the overall housing market, while acknowledging potential softness in the non-residential, Protective & Marine, and potentially, the Asia and European markets in 2020 due to external factors like the coronavirus.  The guidance reflects a continuation of solid growth but with a more moderate pace of EPS growth than last year.
