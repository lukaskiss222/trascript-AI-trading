Sherwin-Williams' earnings call indicates strong Q4 2010 results driven by acquisitions, higher sales volume, and price increases.  However, the company anticipates a relatively moderate top-line growth and tempered diluted net income guidance for 2011, primarily due to continued raw material cost inflation and the loss of some architectural paint volume from Wal-Mart.  Management's comments suggest that the impact of higher raw materials may be a factor mitigating the gains from volume growth and other factors.
