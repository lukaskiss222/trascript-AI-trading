Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlights robust performance in Q4 2020, exceeding expectations with strong growth across all segments, especially in residential repaint and DIY.  Management anticipates continued strong demand in the first half of 2021, driven by new residential and residential repaint, but acknowledges potential choppiness in commercial and property management recovery.  The call projects mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth for the full year, though slightly lower EPS than 2020 due to inflation and the need for increased pricing.
