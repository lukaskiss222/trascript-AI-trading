Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2011 earnings show strong sales growth, driven by price increases and volume improvements, particularly in the Paint Stores Group.  However, raw material cost inflation significantly impacted gross margins, and a one-time IRS settlement charge will reduce earnings per share.  While management anticipates margin improvements in the coming quarters as price increases catch up to input costs, short-term uncertainty exists.  The stock price might see a minor dip initially, reflecting the one-time charge, but long-term positive implications exist due to the company's focus on market share gains and volume increases.
