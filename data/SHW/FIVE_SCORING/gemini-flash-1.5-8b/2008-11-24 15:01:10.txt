Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlights a resilient performance in a challenging economic environment.  While some segments face pressure, notably coil, general industrial, and wood coatings, management expresses confidence in the strength of the company's core packaging, architectural, and automotive refinished product lines, especially the Huarun business in China.  The guidance for 2009 suggests a potentially flat year, with a likely more challenging first half and incremental improvement in the second half, largely due to easing raw material costs.
