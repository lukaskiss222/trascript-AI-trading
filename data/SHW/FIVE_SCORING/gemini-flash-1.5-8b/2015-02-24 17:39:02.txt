Valspar's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted strong Coatings segment performance and volume growth, driven by new business wins and productivity initiatives.  However, the Paints segment faced tougher year-over-year comparisons due to prior strong results and product line adjustments at Lowe's.  Management maintained full-year guidance but modestly lowered sales outlook due to a stronger USD.  The call suggests short-term pressure on the stock from these comparisons but long-term potential, particularly in international markets.
