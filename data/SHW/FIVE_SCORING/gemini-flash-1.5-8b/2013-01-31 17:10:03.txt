Sherwin-Williams' earnings call indicates strong performance, with record sales exceeding expectations. Management projects continued growth in 2013, driven largely by volume increases rather than price hikes.  The guidance anticipates a deceleration in growth after the first quarter, attributed to the challenging year-over-year comparisons.  The company's focus on reinvestment through store expansion and personnel increases is expected to fuel future growth.
