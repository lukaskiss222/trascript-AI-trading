Earnings were in line with expectations, driven by strong consumer paint volume growth, especially in North America, partially offset by weakness in some industrial coatings segments.  Management is confident in the long-term outlook, citing new business wins across different product lines and geographic regions, including positive momentum with professional programs and the expansion of existing markets.  Guidance remains unchanged for the year.
