Sherwin-Williams' Q2 2016 earnings show strong performance in the Paint Stores Group, driven by architectural paint volume growth.  Management expresses confidence in the contractor market and expects continued positive trends.  However, challenges remain in the Consumer and Latin American segments, with weaker-than-expected retail programs and persisting currency headwinds.  These factors suggest a potentially slower growth path for the stock in the short term.
