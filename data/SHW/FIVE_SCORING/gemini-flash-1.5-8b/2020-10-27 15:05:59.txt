Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2020 earnings call highlighted robust DIY demand and significant improvement across all operating segments.  Management emphasized that the company's strong performance exceeded expectations and forecasted continued growth in Q4, though with a normal seasonal slowdown in architectural demand. The call suggests a sustained positive outlook for the stock price, though tempered by the uncertainty about raw material cost inflation, and the degree to which the DIY surge will sustain in the face of an expected gradual return to normal circumstances.
