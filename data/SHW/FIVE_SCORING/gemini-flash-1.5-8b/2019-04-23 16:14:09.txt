The Sherwin-Williams earnings call highlights a mixed first quarter 2019 performance. While sales increased slightly, exceeding expectations in some key segments, the volumes were lower than anticipated, impacting margins in the Americas Group.  Management expresses confidence in the remainder of the year, citing strong customer backlogs; and the company remains optimistic about its ability to outperform the overall market, particularly in the second half with favourable comparisons and an anticipated acceleration of volume growth.
