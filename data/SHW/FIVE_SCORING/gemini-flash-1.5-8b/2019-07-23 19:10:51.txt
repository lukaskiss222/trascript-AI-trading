Sherwin-Williams' Q2 2019 earnings call highlighted strong performance in the Americas segment, particularly in North American paint stores, exceeding expectations.  Management noted favorable pricing trends and cost control measures that contributed to improved profitability across all segments.  A key concern was the softening demand in some Asian and European markets, offsetting strength in other regions, leading to a slightly lower than anticipated overall sales forecast.  The reduction in guidance and the ongoing headwinds in certain international markets may lead to a short-term negative impact on stock price.
