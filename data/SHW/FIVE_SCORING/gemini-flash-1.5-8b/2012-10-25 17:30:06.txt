Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2012 earnings transcript shows strong performance, particularly in the Paint Stores segment, driven by volume growth and pricing increases.  Management anticipates continued growth in the U.S. architectural market, but also notes potential challenges in Latin America and Europe.  The guidance update points to mid-single-digit sales growth in Q4 and high-single digit growth for the full year, alongside an anticipated increase in diluted earnings per share for 2012. This suggests a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
