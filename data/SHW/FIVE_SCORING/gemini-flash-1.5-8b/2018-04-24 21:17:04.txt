Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2018 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations, primarily driven by the outperformance of the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings segments and improved profitability.  Management noted continued strong demand, positive volume growth in various regions, and successful implementation of pricing strategies. The integration of Valspar and the expanded Lowe's partnership are expected to deliver significant revenue increases in the long term. However, the significant increase in raw material costs put pressure on profit margins, despite successful pricing in a few segments; this is expected to be a theme in the near-term future.
