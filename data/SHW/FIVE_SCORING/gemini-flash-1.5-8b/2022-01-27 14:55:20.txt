Sherwin-Williams' earnings call highlights strong demand but acknowledges ongoing raw material and supply chain challenges.  While guidance suggests a high-single-digit to low-double-digit sales increase, this is heavily weighted toward the second half of the year and may be partially offset by persistent inflation. Management emphasizes strategic investments and customer relationships, positioning the company for longer-term growth, but short-term margin pressure remains evident.
