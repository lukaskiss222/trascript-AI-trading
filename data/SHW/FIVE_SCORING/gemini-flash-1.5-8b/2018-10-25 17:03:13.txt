Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2018 earnings show solid performance despite some headwinds.  Sales growth was positive across segments, driven by strong contractor sales, but some slowdown in DIY and protective coatings segments.  Management highlighted ongoing efforts to manage raw material inflation and a lowered full-year adjusted diluted net income per share forecast due to incremental supply chain costs.  The likely short-term impact is that positive contractor momentum should offset some slowing of DIY growth, however, ongoing litigation and cost concerns could create some volatility.
