Sherwin-Williams' Q2 2014 earnings call highlights strong sales growth, particularly in the Paint Stores Group, driven by volume gains across various segments and acquisitions. Management expressed confidence in the sustained momentum, citing positive contractor sentiment and robust order books.  While Latin American performance remains challenging, the overall outlook for the remainder of the year and into 2015 is positive, fueled by expected growth in both residential and non-residential segments, and proactive stock buybacks.
