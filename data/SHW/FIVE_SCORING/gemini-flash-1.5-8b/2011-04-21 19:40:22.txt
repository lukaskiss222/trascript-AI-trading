Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2011 earnings show strong financial performance, driven by acquisitions and price increases, but with a cautious outlook.  While sales and earnings increased substantially, core volume growth was muted, and management anticipates continued raw material cost pressure and less positive volume growth in the remainder of the year.  The company's focus on maintaining pricing discipline to offset raw material cost increases and proactive inventory management suggests a strategic approach to the challenges in the short term.
