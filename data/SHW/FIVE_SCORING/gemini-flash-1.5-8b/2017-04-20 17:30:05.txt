Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2017 earnings call highlighted strong performance in the Paint Stores Group, driven by volume growth across all end markets.  Management expressed confidence in the future of this segment despite some softness in DIY demand.  However, the Consumer segment experienced a significant decline in sales, attributed largely to a challenging market and not a specific issue.  The company is anticipating mid-to-high-single digit growth in Q2 and is upgrading full-year EPS guidance. Overall, the call indicates a positive outlook, but with challenges in the Consumer segment that require proactive strategies for recovery.
