The Sherwin-Williams earnings call highlights significant near-term challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with expected low to mid-teens percentage sales decline in Q2 2020.  Management, however, emphasizes robust underlying demand, focusing on initiatives like online ordering and curbside pickup to mitigate the impact. A continued positive outlook for the long term is maintained, and management anticipates recovery beginning in Q3, with growth resuming afterward, particularly in DIY and exterior markets.
