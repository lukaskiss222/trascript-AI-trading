Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2009 earnings show continued weakness in architectural paint sales, particularly in new construction.  While gross margins improved due to lower raw material and SG&A costs, overall sales and profits declined significantly.  Management noted modest improvement in DIY sales and sequential improvement in some regional markets, indicating potential future growth, but significant challenges remain in the broader market, especially in commercial construction.  This suggests a likely negative to neutral impact on the stock price over the next two weeks as investors digest the details and overall market conditions.
