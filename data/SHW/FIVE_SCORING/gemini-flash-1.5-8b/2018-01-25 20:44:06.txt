The earnings call highlights strong performance in the Paint Stores Group with double-digit same-store sales growth, exceeding market expectations.  However, the Consumer Brands Group experienced significantly lower-than-expected sales and profit, likely due to a combination of market softness and inventory adjustments by retail customers.  Management's cautious guidance, particularly the suspension of quarterly earnings per share guidance,  suggests a degree of uncertainty regarding the short-term impact of raw material inflation and the integration of the Valspar acquisition.
