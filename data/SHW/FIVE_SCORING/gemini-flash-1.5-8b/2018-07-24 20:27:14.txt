Sherwin-Williams' Q2 2018 earnings call highlighted strong sales growth, driven by the Valspar acquisition's performance and positive demand trends across various segments.  Management expressed confidence in achieving full-year guidance, albeit with some upward revisions relating to raw material costs and acquisition-related expenses.  While the call contained reassuring statements about sustained growth trajectory, investors should monitor evolving raw material prices and the long-term impact of the Lowe's partnership, factors that could impact future earnings.
