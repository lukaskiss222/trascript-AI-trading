The Sherwin-Williams earnings call highlights robust financial performance, with double-digit sales and earnings growth in 2011.  Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue this trend, though caution was noted about a lag in the recovery of margins due to raw material costs.  Guidance suggests modest sales growth next year, driven by new business and a moderating raw material environment. The significant goodwill impairment charge associated with the wood coatings business, however, is a short-term negative factor that may impact the company's stock over the next few weeks.
