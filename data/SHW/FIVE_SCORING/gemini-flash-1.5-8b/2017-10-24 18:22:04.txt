Sherwin-Williams' earnings call reveals a mixed picture.  While the company exceeded some expectations with paint store performance and Valspar integration remaining on track, the impact of hurricanes negatively affected results.  Pricing actions are already underway to mitigate raw material inflation which will likely be a bigger headwind going forward.  Management's optimistic tone regarding future growth and sustained momentum in core businesses suggests potential short-term stock dip, followed by moderate recovery over the next 1-2 weeks as investors react to hurricane impact.
