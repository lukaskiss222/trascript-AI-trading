Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted strong Paint Stores Group performance, with comp store sales exceeding expectations.  Management attributes this to both robust residential demand and a positive shift in the market toward professional contractors.  While the call projected continued growth and tempered raw material cost concerns,  the company's reliance on a strong recovery in the architectural market, particularly in the residential sector, bodes well for future performance in the short term.
