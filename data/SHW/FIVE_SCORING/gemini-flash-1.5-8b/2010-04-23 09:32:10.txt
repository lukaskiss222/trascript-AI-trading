Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2010 earnings show a mixed picture. While sales momentum improved significantly in March, reversing earlier concerns, management highlighted ongoing pressure from raw material costs.  The company's guidance increase for 2010, combined with initiatives to optimize cost structure, suggests optimism about future performance despite short-term challenges. The stock will likely see a short-term positive impact driven by the strength in March.
