Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2016 earnings show strong growth, driven by robust sales in the Paint Stores Group, especially with double-digit comparable store sales growth and strong performance from some national account customers.  Management highlights a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, citing healthy contractor order books and increasing demand for industrial products.  The company's guidance, including increased full-year diluted earnings per share projections, suggests a positive short-term outlook and likely a stock price rally.
