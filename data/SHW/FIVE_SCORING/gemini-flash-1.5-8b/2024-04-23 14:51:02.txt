Sherwin-Williams' Q1 2024 earnings show sales at the lower end of guidance, primarily due to lower-than-expected volume in Paint Stores Group.

The company's focus on share gains and new customer acquisitions, coupled with margin expansion, suggests the stock may see positive, albeit muted short-term impacts.
