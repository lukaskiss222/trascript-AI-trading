The Sherwin-Williams Company reported a solid Q3 2007 with increased sales, earnings, and cash flow, driven by acquisitions, tight expense controls, and margin recovery. The full-year 2007 EPS guidance was raised significantly, suggesting resilience despite raw material cost increases. Management's confidence in handling challenges in Q4 2007 bodes well for maintaining positive momentum in stock price in the near term.
