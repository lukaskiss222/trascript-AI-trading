The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q3 results show a year-on-year earnings decline ($0.50 vs. $0.57 per share), with gross margins down 220 basis points to 29% due to higher raw material costs, despite modest core growth. Management's positive outlook on pricing actions and no further guidance cut signal cautious optimism, but the market might still react negatively due to potential margin pressures in the near term from ongoing raw material cost inflation.
