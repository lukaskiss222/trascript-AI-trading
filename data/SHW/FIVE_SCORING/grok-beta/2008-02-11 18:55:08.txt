The company reported several positive developments including a good quarter, international growth, new business generation in packaging and architectural, and stringent cost management. However, the architectural market weakness and raw material cost increases could pose short-term challenges in the architectural paint segment. The management's focus on offsetting higher material costs with price increases and operational improvements might limit the immediate impact on profitability. The overall tone suggests a stable but cautious outlook. Given the mixed performance and alignment with expectations, the stock price impact is likely neutral in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
