### Analysis

The earnings call for Sherwin-Williams Company highlighted several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Raw Material Costs**: The company continues to face significant raw material cost increases, particularly in titanium dioxide (TiO2). While the company expects these costs to stabilize, the current environment remains challenging, impacting gross margins.

2. **Inventory Management**: The company is managing inventory levels carefully, with finished goods inventory levels normalizing and raw materials inventory levels slightly higher. This suggests a cautious approach to inventory management to avoid overstocking.

3. **Pricing Actions**: The company has implemented several price increases, with the latest one in October being around 8% to 9%. The company expects these price increases to help close the gap on input costs, but it remains to be seen how customers will respond.

4. **Market Conditions**: The company expects the architectural and industrial coatings markets to remain positive, but the impact of raw material costs will continue to be a headwind. The company is also seeing increased competition from big-box retailers entering the professional painting contractor market.

5. **Acquisitions**: The company completed an acquisition in the third quarter, which added to the company's sales but also resulted in a loss due to inventory step-up and other factors.

### Conclusion

The short-term outlook for Sherwin-Williams Company stock appears to be negative due to the continued pressure from raw material costs and the uncertainty surrounding pricing actions. The company's cautious approach to inventory management and its focus on cost control are positive signs, but the impact of these factors may not be fully realized in the next 1-2 weeks. The company's guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2011 also indicates a wide range for earnings per share, reflecting the uncertainty in the market.
