Based on the earnings call transcript, the key points that stand out are:

1. **Strong Q3 Performance**: The company reported strong financial results for Q3, with adjusted EPS increasing by 17.1% and gross margin improving significantly.
2. **Growth in North America**: Sales in North America increased by 8.7%, with strong performance in residential repaint and commercial segments.
3. **Challenges in International Markets**: Sales in international markets, particularly Asia and Australia, were soft, but the company remains optimistic about the long-term prospects.
4. **Cost Control and Margin Improvement**: The company is focused on cost control and margin improvement, with a target to achieve a gross margin of 45% to 48% by the end of 2019.
5. **M&A and Strategic Growth**: The company is actively pursuing strategic growth opportunities, including M&A, and is focusing on organic growth as well.
6. **Raw Material Costs**: The company expects raw material costs to moderate in the fourth quarter, but there is still work to be done to fully offset the significant increases seen in 2017 and 2018.
7. **Outlook for 2020**: The company expects adjusted EPS to increase by approximately 14% in 2020, with a range of $20.90 to $21.30 per share.

Given these points, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. The strong Q3 performance, growth in North America, and the positive outlook for 2020 are all positive signals for the company's stock. However, the company's focus on cost control and margin improvement, as well as the potential challenges in international markets, could lead to some short-term volatility.
