### Analysis

The earnings call for The Sherwin-Williams Company revealed mixed performance, with notable impacts from natural disasters and raw material inflation. The company reported a 37.4% increase in net sales to $4.51 billion, driven primarily by Valspar sales and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group. However, the company experienced a 16.2% increase in gross profit dollars, which was partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean. The gross margin decreased to 42.2% of sales, and the net income per share decreased to $3.36 from $4.08 in 2016.

Key points from the call include:

- **Natural Disasters:** The storms had a significant impact on sales, particularly in the Southeast and Southwestern divisions. The company expects a mid to high single-digit increase in sales in the fourth quarter, with a potential for a strong fourth quarter to make up for lost revenue in the third quarter.
- **Raw Material Inflation:** The company reported higher raw material costs, which impacted gross margins. The hurricane disruptions also pushed the full-year estimate of raw material cost inflation to the high end of the mid-single-digit range. The company expects higher raw material costs to be a stronger headwind in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.
- **Synergies and Integration:** The company expects to achieve $160 million in synergies in 2017, up from the $106 million forecast at the end of the second quarter. The company also expects to increase the annual run rate of synergies to $160 million in 2018, up from the $106 million forecast at the end of the second quarter.
- **Future Outlook:** The company expects mid to high single-digit growth in sales in the fourth quarter and a mid-single-digit increase in sales in 2018. The company also expects to achieve a mid-single-digit increase in EPS in 2018, with a range of $11.20 to $11.50 per share.
