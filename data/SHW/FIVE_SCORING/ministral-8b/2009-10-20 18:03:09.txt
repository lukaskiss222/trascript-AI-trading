### Analysis

The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q3 2009 earnings call revealed a challenging environment, with sales declining 12% due to weak paint sales volumes across all categories, unfavorable currency translation rates, and reduced raw materials costs. The company's gross margin increased due to lower raw material costs and selling prices, but overall net income decreased by 1.1%. Management provided guidance for the fourth quarter and full year, expecting sales to decline by 11.5-12.5% compared to 2008, with EPS in the range of $3.52-$3.72 per share. The company also mentioned ongoing efforts to manage expenses and working capital, as well as potential acquisitions and diversification efforts.

### Conclusion

The stock price is likely to face short-term pressure due to the company's reduced sales guidance and the challenging market conditions. However, the company's focus on cost-saving measures and potential acquisitions suggests long-term potential. The stock is expected to remain volatile in the near term due to the ongoing economic uncertainty and the company's continued efforts to manage its financial position.
