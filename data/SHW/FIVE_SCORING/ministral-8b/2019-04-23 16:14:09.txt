Based on the earnings transcript, the company reported strong financial performance, with sales and earnings per share (EPS) both up year-over-year. The company also provided guidance for the full year, projecting sales growth and EPS growth. However, the company faced some challenges in the first quarter, including slower-than-expected sales growth and margin compression. The company also mentioned that it is facing some uncertainty in the market, including the potential impact of tariffs on its business. Overall, the company remains optimistic about its prospects for the year, but the challenges it faced in the first quarter may cause some uncertainty in the short term.

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, as the company's performance was in line with expectations and the market is still digesting the mixed signals from the earnings call. However, if the company's guidance is revised downward or if there are any negative surprises in the second quarter, the stock price could be negatively impacted. Conversely, if the company's guidance is revised upward or if there are any positive surprises in the second quarter, the stock price could be positively impacted.
