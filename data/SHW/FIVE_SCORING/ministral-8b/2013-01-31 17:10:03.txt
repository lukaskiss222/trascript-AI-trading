Based on the provided transcript, the key takeaways are:

1. **Sales and Earnings Growth:** The company reported strong sales growth and earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2012, driven by higher paint sales volume and selling price increases. However, the company expects a slowdown in growth for 2013 due to the challenging first quarter comps and expected raw material cost inflation.

2. **Store Growth:** The company plans to open 70 to 80 new stores in 2013, bringing the total store count to around 3,590. This growth is expected to drive sales and EPS growth in the coming years.

3. **Comex Acquisition:** The company expects to close the acquisition of Comex in the first half of 2013. This will add around 300 stores to the company's store count and strengthen its position in the Canadian and Western markets.

4. **Raw Material Costs:** The company expects low-single-digit raw material cost inflation in 2013, which will help maintain gross margins and drive EPS growth.

5. **SG&A Expenses:** The company expects SG&A expenses to improve as a percent of sales in 2013, driven by improved operating efficiencies and lower raw material costs.

Based on these factors, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, as investors will likely react positively to the strong sales and earnings growth in 2012 and the expected growth in 2013. However, the stock may face some pressure in the short term due to the challenging first quarter comps and expected raw material cost inflation.
