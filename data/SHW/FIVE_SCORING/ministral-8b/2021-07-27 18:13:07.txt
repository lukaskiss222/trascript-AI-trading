Based on the earnings transcript, the company's performance in the second quarter was strong, with robust demand across most business segments. The company's gross margins were under pressure due to raw material cost inflation, but the company has been proactive in implementing price increases to offset these costs. The company's adjusted diluted net income per share grew by a double-digit percentage, and EBITDA expanded by a high single-digit percentage. The company's capital allocation policy has been consistent, with a focus on organic growth opportunities and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.

The company's outlook for the third quarter and full year 2021 is positive, with expectations for robust demand in all North American pro architectural end markets and continued tightness in the supply chain. The company anticipates raw material availability to continue to improve throughout the quarter, and expects to be in a make and ship mode until the seasonally slower fourth quarter when they expect to begin building inventory. The company's guidance for the third quarter 2021 consolidated net sales is up by mid to high single digit percentage compared to the third quarter of 2020, and expects The Americas Group sales to be up by a mid to high single digit percentage with pro sales at or above the high end of this range and DIY sales returning to a more historic level. The company expects Consumer Brands sales to be down by a mid to high teens percentage, including a negative impact of approximately five percentage points related to the Wattyl divestiture, and Performance Coatings sales to be up by a high teens to low 20s percentage. The company expects diluted net income per share for 2021 to be in the range of $8.01 to $8.31 per share, compared to $7.36 per share earned in 2020. Full year 2021 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of $0.80 per share and the loss on the Wattyl divestiture of $0.34 per share. On an adjusted basis, the company expects full year 2021 earnings per share of $9.15 to $9.45, an increase of 13.6% at the midpoint over the $8.19 they delivered in 2020.
