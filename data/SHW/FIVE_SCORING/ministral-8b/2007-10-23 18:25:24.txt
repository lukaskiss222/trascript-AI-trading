Based on the provided earnings transcript, the key points to consider for the short-term impact on Sherwin-Williams' stock price are:

1. **Strong Q3 Results**: The company reported strong financial results, with sales and earnings growth, and a positive outlook for the fourth quarter and full year.
2. **Acquisition Impact**: The company completed four acquisitions in Q3, which diluted earnings but are expected to bring synergies in the future.
3. **Raw Material Costs**: The company expects raw material costs to increase by 2 to 4% in 2008, which could put pressure on margins.
4. **Legal Issues**: The company is facing legal issues in Rhode Island and Wisconsin, which could result in significant expenses if the cases are not resolved favorably.
5. **M&A Activity**: The company is expected to continue with M&A activities in the future.

Considering these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to the uncertainty around raw material costs and legal issues. However, the strong Q3 results and positive outlook for the future may provide some support to the stock price.
