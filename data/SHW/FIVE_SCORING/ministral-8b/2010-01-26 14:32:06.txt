**Analysis:**

The Sherwin-Williams Company's earnings call revealed a mixed performance in 2009, with sales declining by 11.1% to $7.09 billion, primarily due to weak economic conditions. Despite this, the company managed to improve its gross margin to 46% of sales and net income as a percent of sales to 6.1%. The management team highlighted the company's strategic initiatives, including cost-cutting measures, supply chain improvements, and expansion into new markets. The outlook for 2010 was cautiously optimistic, with guidance for net sales to increase in the low to mid single digits, driven by a rebound in the residential market and continued growth in the consumer segment. The company also expects to maintain its strong cash flow performance and continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price of Sherwin-Williams Company is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's ability to manage expenses and improve margins, coupled with its strategic initiatives, provides a positive outlook. However, the uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery and the company's exposure to commercial real estate markets may dampen the stock's performance in the near term. The stock is likely to see some volatility but is expected to remain in a relatively stable range.
