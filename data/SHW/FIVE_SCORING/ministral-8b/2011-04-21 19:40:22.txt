### Analysis:

The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q1 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a strong opening quarter with record sales of $1.86 billion, driven primarily by acquisitions and selling price increases. However, the gross margin decreased due to raw material cost increases and the dilution from acquisitions. The company also reported a significant increase in SG&A expenses, which was mainly driven by the three acquisitions made last year. The management team expressed confidence in recovering the gross margin in the future but acknowledged that the raw material cost increases would continue to be a headwind for the company.

The company's guidance for the second quarter and full year 2011 was positive, with expectations for sales growth in the high single digits and earnings per share growth in the low to mid-teens. The management team also highlighted the company's strategic growth initiatives in the solar ceramics and non-defense markets, as well as the ongoing diversification efforts.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong opening quarter results and the positive guidance for the second quarter and full year. However, the stock may face some short-term pressure due to the continued raw material cost increases and the uncertainty surrounding the defense market. Overall, the company's strategic growth initiatives and diversification efforts suggest long-term potential, but the stock may face short-term volatility due to the headwinds in the raw material market.
