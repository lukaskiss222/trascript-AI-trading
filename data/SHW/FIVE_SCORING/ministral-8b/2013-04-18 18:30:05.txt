### Analysis

The earnings call for Sherwin-Williams Company highlighted a mixed performance in the first quarter of 2013. The company reported a 1.4% increase in net sales, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in the Paint Stores Group. However, there were some notable challenges, including a 3.7% decrease in sales in the Consumer Group due to the loss of some paint business with large retail customers and unfavorable currency translation affecting the Latin American Coatings Group.

The company's outlook for the second quarter and full year 2013 was tempered by these challenges, but the management expressed optimism about the demand trends for the second quarter. They also mentioned the ongoing expansion of store locations and investments in store and territory staffing.

### Conclusion

The short-term implications for the stock price are likely to be mixed. While the company's overall performance was positive, the challenges in the Consumer Group and the Latin American Coatings Group, along with the uncertainty surrounding the Comex acquisition, may create some short-term volatility. The stock may experience a moderate positive impact due to the company's strong performance in the Paint Stores Group and the optimism around the second quarter and full year outlook.
