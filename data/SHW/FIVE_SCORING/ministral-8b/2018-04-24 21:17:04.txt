Based on the earnings transcript, Sherwin-Williams reported strong Q1 2018 results with a 43.6% increase in sales, a 25.6% increase in gross profit, and a 9.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. The company also provided guidance for the full year 2018, expecting sales to increase by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage compared to 2017. However, the company also warned that it may face challenges in the second quarter due to raw material cost increases.

The company's performance was driven by strong demand across most businesses, and the company is making good progress on the Valspar integration, value capture, and pricing initiatives to offset raw material inflation. The company also reported strong growth in the Americas Group, with sales increasing by 6.6% in the first quarter.

The company's guidance for the full year 2018 was $14.95 to $15.45 per share, which was an increase of 26% year-over-year. The company also expects to book most of the remaining costs to achieve these synergies in 2018, and they are increasingly confident in their long-term annual run rate range of $385 million to $415 million.

Overall, the company's strong Q1 2018 results and guidance suggest that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory in 2018. However, the company's warning about challenges in the second quarter due to raw material cost increases suggests that there may be some headwinds ahead.
