### Analysis:

Valspar's Q4 and full-year earnings call presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong sales and earnings growth, particularly in the Coatings segment, driven by volume gains and new business wins. The Paints segment also performed well, with notable growth in international regions like China and Australia. However, there were significant challenges, including a loss of business in North America and a planned reduction in product line offerings at a major customer, which could potentially affect sales in 2015. Management expects to mitigate the impact of these changes through cost-cutting measures and continued growth in international markets.

### Conclusion:

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the loss of business in North America and the planned reduction in product offerings. However, the company's strong performance in international markets and its focus on cost-cutting measures suggest long-term potential. The stock may experience volatility in the short term, but it could rally if the company can successfully navigate the challenges it faces.
