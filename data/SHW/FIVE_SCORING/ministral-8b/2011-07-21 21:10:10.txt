Based on the transcript, Sherwin-Williams reported second-quarter 2011 earnings with mixed results. The company achieved record net sales of $2.35 billion, driven by acquisitions and favorable currency translation rates. However, gross margin decreased by 200 basis points to 43.4% of sales, and net income decreased by $2.6 million to $179.1 million. The company expects its effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range for the full year 2011. Management highlighted the challenges posed by raw material cost increases, particularly titanium dioxide, and the need for continued price increases to offset these costs.

The company's outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011 remains cautious, with guidance for consolidated net sales to increase in the high single digits to low teens over the previous year. The company expects diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.75 per share for the third quarter and $4.55 to $4.85 per share for the full year 2011.

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's focus on strategic growth and diversification efforts suggests long-term potential.
