Based on the earnings transcript for The Sherwin-Williams Company, the short-term implications for the stock price can be summarized as follows:

1. **Revenue and Margin Performance**: The company reported a 1% increase in net sales to $1.565 billion, with gross profit increasing by $11.4 million to $692 million. The gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.9% in the first quarter of 2009. This indicates a positive trend in profitability, which could be seen as a positive signal for the stock.

2. **Raw Material Costs**: The company expects raw material costs to peak in the second quarter of 2010 and then ease. This is a significant concern as it could impact profitability in the near term. However, the company has taken measures to mitigate this impact, such as price increases and cost reductions.

3. **Store Expansion and Closures**: The company plans to add approximately 40-50 new stores during the year and has a net number of 30-45 closures expected. This indicates a balanced approach to store expansion and reduction, which could be seen as a positive sign for the company's long-term strategy.

4. **Contractor Sentiment**: There is a noticeable improvement in the sentiment and activity of contractors, which could lead to increased demand for the company's products.

5. **Acquisition Impact**: The acquisition of Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings is expected to contribute to revenue growth, with an estimated impact of 1.5-1.7% on the P&L for the year.

Considering these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. The company's positive revenue and margin performance, along with improving contractor sentiment, outweigh the concerns about raw material costs and the timing of price increases. Additionally, the acquisition of Sayerlack is expected to contribute to revenue growth. Therefore, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
