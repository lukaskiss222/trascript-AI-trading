Despite a significant decline in sales due to the global recession, the company maintained its earnings guidance and improved gross margins through effective cost management and productivity gains. Management's reaffirmation of full-year guidance and expectations of raw material cost relief in the second half signal stability. The stock is likely to see a modest positive impact as investors recognize the company's resilience in a challenging environment.
