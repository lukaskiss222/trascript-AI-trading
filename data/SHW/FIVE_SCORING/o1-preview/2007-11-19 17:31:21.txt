Valspar's earnings call indicated modest underlying sales growth and declining gross margins due to higher raw material costs and lower volumes in higher-margin segments. Management's cautious guidance for 2008, highlighting continued weakness in U.S. markets and only modest EPS growth, may concern investors. As a result, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to anticipated challenges in core markets.
