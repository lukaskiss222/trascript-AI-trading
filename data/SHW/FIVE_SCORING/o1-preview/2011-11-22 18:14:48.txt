Valspar reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year results with significant sales and adjusted EPS growth, and provided guidance for continued double-digit earnings growth in 2012. Despite a non-cash impairment charge related to wood coatings, the company's operational performance, focus on growth initiatives, and positive outlook suggest investor confidence may increase. Therefore, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
