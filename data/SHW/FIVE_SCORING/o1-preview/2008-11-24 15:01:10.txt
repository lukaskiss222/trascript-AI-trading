Valspar's earnings call reflects cautious optimism in a challenging global recession. While earnings met expectations and management is confident in cost management and sustaining key business segments, the flat guidance for 2009 EPS and acknowledgment of economic headwinds may temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term.
