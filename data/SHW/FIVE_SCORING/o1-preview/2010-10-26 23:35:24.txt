Sherwin-Williams reported solid revenue growth in Q3 2010, driven by acquisitions and improved sales volumes. However, the company is facing significant raw material cost pressures, particularly with rising titanium dioxide prices, which are impacting margins. Additionally, the loss of some business with Walmart and the dilution from recent acquisitions may weigh on short-term investor sentiment. Overall, the stock may experience short-term pressure due to these margin concerns and uncertainties.
