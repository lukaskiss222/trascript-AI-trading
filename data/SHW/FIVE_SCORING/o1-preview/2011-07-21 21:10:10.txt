Sherwin-Williams reported solid sales growth driven by price increases and acquisitions, but faced significant gross margin contraction due to raw material cost inflation, particularly in titanium dioxide. Management lowered EPS guidance for the year despite raising sales expectations, citing raw material costs as a headwind to earnings. The stock is likely to experience short-term negative impact due to margin pressures and reduced profitability outlook.
