Sherwin-Williams reported strong sales growth driven by acquisitions and price increases, but core volume growth was only slightly positive. Management expressed concerns about rising raw material costs, particularly titanium dioxide, which are expected to pressure gross margins in the near term. Although they reaffirmed full-year guidance, the cautious tone and anticipated margin compression may lead to negative short-term sentiment on the stock.
