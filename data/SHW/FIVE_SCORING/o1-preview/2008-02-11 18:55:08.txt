Valspar reported solid first-quarter results with a 10.2% increase in sales, driven by international growth and strong performance in its packaging business. While gross margins declined due to raw material cost increases, management is confident that price increases will offset these pressures moving forward. With reaffirmed guidance and strategic initiatives in place, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely neutral.
