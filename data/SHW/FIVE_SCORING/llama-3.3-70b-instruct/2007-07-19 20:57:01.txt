The Sherwin-Williams Company's Q2 2007 earnings call revealed a strong quarter with record sales, earnings, and cash flow, driven by improved architectural paint sales, industrial maintenance coating sales, and the acquisition of M.A. Bruder & Sons and Nitco Paints. The company raised its full-year guidance, expecting sales to increase in the low single-digits and diluted net income per share to be in the range of $4.60 to $4.70. The stock is likely to react positively to the earnings beat and increased guidance, as well as the company'sconfidence in managing challenges ahead.
