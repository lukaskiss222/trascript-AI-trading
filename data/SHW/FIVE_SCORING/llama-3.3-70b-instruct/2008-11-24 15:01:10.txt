The Sherwin-Williams Company's earnings transcript indicates a mixed performance, with some positive trends and areas of concern. The company's Q4 sales were up 8.3%, but the underlying growth was 3.8% excluding the extra week in the quarter. The paint segment performed well, while the coil and general industrial businesses faced challenges. Management expects 2009 to be a difficult year, with a global recession impacting some of their businesses, but they are confident in their ability to manage costs and generate cash. They also expect to benefit from lower raw material costs and are committed to restoring margins.
