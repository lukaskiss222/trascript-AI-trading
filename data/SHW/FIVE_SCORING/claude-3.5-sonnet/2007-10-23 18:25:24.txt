Based on my analysis of Sherwin-Williams' Q3 2007 earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong earnings performance with consolidated net income up 12% and EPS up 19%, beating expectations while maintaining margin expansion despite raw material cost pressures.

2. Management raised full-year EPS guidance to $4.70-4.75 from previous guidance, showing confidence in near-term execution.

3. The company demonstrated pricing power and cost control, with gross margins improving 80 basis points and SG&A costs well managed. New $30M share repurchase authorization signals continued return of capital to shareholders.

While there are some headwinds from housing market weakness, the company's strong execution, margin expansion, and raised guidance should drive positive sentiment in the near-term.
