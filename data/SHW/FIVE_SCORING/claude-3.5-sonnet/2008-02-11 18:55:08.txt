Based on the earnings call transcript, Sherwin-Williams delivered a solid first quarter despite challenges. Key positives include: strong international performance (sales up 20%), good packaging coatings growth (up mid-teens), effective cost control, and successful price increases to offset raw material costs. Management maintained full-year guidance and expressed confidence in their ability to manage through market headwinds. While architectural paint demand remains weak in the US, new business gains and operational improvements are helping offset this. The acquisition of Aries in Mexico also provides growth opportunities. The company's balanced portfolio and global presence provide resilience. While near-term challenges exist, management's confident tone and strong execution suggest the stock should perform reasonably well in the coming weeks.
