Sherwin-Williams reported a modest 1% increase in consolidated net sales for Q1 2010 mainly due to foreign currency benefits, with certain segments like the global finishes group performing especially well. However, there are challenges, including sluggish paint store sales with a 5.3% decline, impacted by decreased paint volume. The company implemented price increases to offset rising raw material costs, with expectations for mid to high single-digit sales growth for the full year. Management appears optimistic, highlighting improved demand and expansion efforts. While short-term challenges in raw material costs and sales declines in some segments exist, the positive long-term guidance and strategic price adjustments may bolster the stock positively in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
