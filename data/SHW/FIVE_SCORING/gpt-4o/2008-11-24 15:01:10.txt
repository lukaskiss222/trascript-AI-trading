Sherwin-Williams delivered a solid performance with an 8.3% sales increase in Q4 2008, supported by growth in international markets, particularly in China, and a strong performance in the paint segment. However, the company faces challenges, such as higher raw material costs affecting margins and a global recession, potentially affecting demand in the industrial and wood products sectors. Despite these issues, management expressed confidence in controlling costs and maintaining strong brand performance. The outlook for 2009 appears cautious but stable, suggesting a neutral short-term stock impact.
