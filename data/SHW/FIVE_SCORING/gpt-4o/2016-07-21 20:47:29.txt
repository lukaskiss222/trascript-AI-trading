Sherwin-Williams reported a mixed second-quarter 2016 performance, with consolidated net sales growth of 2.8% driven by the Paint Stores Group, which saw gains in architectural paint volumes. However, they also faced challenges like unfavorable currency translations and a decline in Latin America sales. Management highlighted growth in some market segments but noted ongoing difficulties in several Latin American countries. While the company demonstrated solid gross margin improvements, the increased SG&A expenses and the impact of acquisition-related costs tempered overall gains. Given the mixed results, the short-term impact on Sherwin-Williams' stock is likely neutral as the positives and negatives offset each other.
