The Sherwin-Williams Companyâ€™s earnings call for the end of 2009 presented mixed results with a decrease in sales but an improvement in gross margins and net income for the quarter, highlighting effective expense management and increased efficiency. Despite facing significant headwinds in certain market segments such as commercial construction, the company managed to close 2009 on a positive note and is modestly optimistic for 2010 with sales growth expected. However, the conservative guidance for the first quarter and ongoing commercial market challenges may temper immediate positive investor sentiment, with the stock likely to see a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term.
