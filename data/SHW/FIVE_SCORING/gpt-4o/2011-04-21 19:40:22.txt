The Sherwin-Williams Company reported strong financial results for Q1 2011, with a 18.5% increase in consolidated net sales driven by acquisitions and selling price increases. However, the gross margin decreased due to higher raw material costs, which the company anticipates will continue to rise. Management remains cautiously optimistic about the domestic market demand for the rest of the year and has reaffirmed their guidance with expected sales and earnings growth. Short-term concerns include the impact of raw material cost inflation, particularly with TiO2 supply, and ongoing challenges in certain market segments, which could potentially pressure the stock. Overall, given the strong start and strategic initiatives, the stock may experience a positive impact in the short-term, despite some headwinds.
