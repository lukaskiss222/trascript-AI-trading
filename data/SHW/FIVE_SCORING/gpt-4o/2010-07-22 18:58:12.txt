Sherwin-Williams reported solid Q2 2010 results with significant sales and net income growth. Despite facing raw material cost pressures, the company managed to expand its operating margins across segments through effective cost management and pricing strategies. The company also expressed confidence in maintaining its full-year sales and earnings guidance, driven by strength in its core business segments and ongoing store expansions. However, uncertainties related to raw material supply and broader economic conditions pose a risk. The upbeat results and steady guidance suggest a short-term positive impact on the stock.
