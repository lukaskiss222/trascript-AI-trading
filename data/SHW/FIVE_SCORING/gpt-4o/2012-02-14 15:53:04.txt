Sherwin-Williams reported a solid first quarter with a 5.1% sales increase and a substantial 59% rise in adjusted EPS year-over-year. The company benefited from pricing actions, improved productivity, and moderating raw material costs, leading to better gross and operating margins. Management raised their full-year earnings guidance, highlighting strong start despite a challenging macro environment anticipated for the remainder of the year. Although cautious about demand and raw material inflation, the improved financial performance and upward guidance revision should positively impact the stock in the short term.
