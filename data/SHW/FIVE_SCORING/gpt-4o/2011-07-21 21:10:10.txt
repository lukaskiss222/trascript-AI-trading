Sherwin-Williams' earnings call painted a complex picture. The company showed a solid sales increase of 9.9% year-over-year for Q2 2011, driven by price hikes, acquisitions, and a favorable currency environment. However, raw material costs, particularly for titanium dioxide, have been a significant headwind, overwhelming cost-recovery efforts and squeezing gross margins. Sherwin-Williams is navigating these challenges with additional price increases and store expansions. Given the companyâ€™s initiatives and positive outlook for the second half, short-term stock performance is likely to be stable with possible mild upward momentum.
