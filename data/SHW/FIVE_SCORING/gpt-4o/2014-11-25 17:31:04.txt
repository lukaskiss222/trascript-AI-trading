Sherwin-Williams reported strong quarterly performance with an 11% increase in sales and a significant rise in EPS by 42%, driven by volume gains in both Coatings and Paints segments. The company's focus on growth initiatives, successful international expansion, and the integration of acquisitions like Inver have strengthened its market position. Despite a recent loss of a North American product line, the company remains optimistic about leveraging its diversified portfolio, productivity initiatives, and ongoing buybacks to maintain growth and shareholder returns. The positive guidance for 2015 suggests a continuation of strong performance in the upcoming weeks.
