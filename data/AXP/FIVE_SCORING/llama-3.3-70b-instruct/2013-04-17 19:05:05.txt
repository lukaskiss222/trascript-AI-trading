American Express's Q1 2013 earnings transcript reveals a mix of positive and neutral signals. The company reported 5% FX-adjusted revenue growth, driven by a 6% increase in billed business, and a 7% rise in diluted EPS. However, operating expenses increased only 1% year-over-year, and the company maintained its commitment to controlling expenses. The transcript also highlights the company's strong capital position, with a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 12.6%, and its plan to return $4 billion to shareholders in 2013. While the company faces challenges, including slower growth in Corporate Services and Travel-related spend, its diversified business model and focus on expense control position it well for the future. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's solid financial performance and commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
