American Express reported strong revenue growth and excellent returns, driven by a multiyear investment strategy that has yielded industry-leading performance. However, the company faces a more challenging economic environment in 2008, with a moderately weaker U.S. economy and rising write-off rates. Despite these headwinds, American Express expects to deliver 4% to 6% EPS growth, driven by a strong business model and a focus on prudent expense management, careful credit risk management, and strategic investments. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key credit metrics, but the company's long-term prospects remain intact.
