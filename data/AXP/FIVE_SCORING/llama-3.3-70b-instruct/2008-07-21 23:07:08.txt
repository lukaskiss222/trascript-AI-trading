American Express's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with solid revenue growth and strong business metrics, but a significant increase in credit losses and a disappointing bottom line. The company's guidance for the rest of the year was also tempered, citing a weakening U.S. economy and higher expected write-offs. While management expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects and competitive position, the near-term outlook is cloudy, and the stock may face short-term pressure due to the lowered guidance and credit concerns.
