American Express's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company reporting strong billed business growth and improved credit trends, but also facing headwinds from declining loan balances and yields. The company's expense ratio is expected to remain elevated in the near term as it continues to invest in growth initiatives, but management believes it has the flexibility to adjust spending as needed. While the company's long-term targets are intact, the near-term outlook is more uncertain, and the stock may face pressure due to tempered guidance and regulatory uncertainties.
