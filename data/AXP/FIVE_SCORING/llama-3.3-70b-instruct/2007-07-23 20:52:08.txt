American Express reported strong Q2 results, with 9% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth, driven by robust spending growth, loan balances, and strong credit quality. Management expressed confidence in the company's position and outlook, citing its ability to leverage its direct merchant relationships, closed-loop network, and attractive rewards programs to deliver premium offerings and drive incremental spending. Despite near-term interest expense and provision pressures, the company expects to continue investing in key growth opportunities while controlling expenses thoughtfully.
