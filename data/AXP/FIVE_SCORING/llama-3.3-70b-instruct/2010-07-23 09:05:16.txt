American Express reported strong Q2 results, with total earnings up 13% and managed total revenues down 1%. However, excluding the impact of securitized interest and a one-time gain in 2009, revenues were up 2%. The company's spending growth was broad-based across segments and geography, with a 16% increase in billed business and a 20% increase in average Cardmember spending. American Express also reported a significant improvement in credit performance, with write-off rates and delinquency rates declining. The company's reserve coverage remains cautious due to uncertainty in the economic environment. Given the strong results and improving credit trends, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
