American Express reported strong Q3 results, with 17% total revenue growth and $1.093 billion in income. The company's billed business growth was 14%, driven by strong spending across all segments. Credit trends also improved, with write-off rates decreasing. The CEO, Kenneth Chenault, emphasized the company's focus on providing premium value to customers and merchants, which has helped American Express navigate regulatory changes and grow its business. Despite potential headwinds from the DOJ lawsuit and regulatory changes, the company's strong performance and diversified business model position it well for continued growth.
