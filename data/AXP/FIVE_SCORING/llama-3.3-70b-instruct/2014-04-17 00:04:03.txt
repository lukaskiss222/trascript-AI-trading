American Express's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with EPS growth of 16% driven by disciplined expense control and a strong capital position, but modestly lower revenue growth. The company's guidance for the year remains unchanged, with a focus on expanding its merchant coverage and acquiring new customers through initiatives like OptBlue and the EveryDay credit card. While the stock may face short-term pressure due to concerns over revenue growth and regulatory headwinds in Europe, the company's long-term prospects and commitment to returning capital to shareholders are positives.
