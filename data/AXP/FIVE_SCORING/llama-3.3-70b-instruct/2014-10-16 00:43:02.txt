American Express reported a solid quarter with 12% EPS growth, driven by higher spending, solid loan growth, and disciplined expense control. The company's guidance for 2015 is cautiously optimistic, with a focus on managing expenses and investing in growth initiatives. Although revenue growth is below long-term targets, the company is confident in its ability to deliver EPS growth through various levers. The recent decline in gas prices and currency fluctuations may have a modest impact on billed business and revenue. Overall, the company's strong capital position, expense control, and growth initiatives position it well for the future.
