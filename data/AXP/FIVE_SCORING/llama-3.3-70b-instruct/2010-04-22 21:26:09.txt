American Express's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong rebound in billed business, driven by a differentiated business model and a more affluent customer base. The company's focus on charge card and premium lending, as well as its investments in marketing and loyalty programs, are paying off, with billed business growth of 16% and a record March spend. While the net interest yield is expected to decline due to the Card Act, the company is confident in its ability to manage rewards costs and maintain a strong value proposition for customers. With a solid balance sheet and improving credit metrics, American Express is well-positioned for long-term growth.
