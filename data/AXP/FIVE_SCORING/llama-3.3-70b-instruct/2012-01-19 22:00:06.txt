American Express's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company achieved record annual sales and strong revenue growth, it also faced challenges such as slower growth in billed business and increasing competition. Management's tone was cautiously optimistic, highlighting the company's ability to control operating expenses and invest in growth initiatives. However, the lack of significant reserve releases and the absence of Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds in 2012 may impact earnings growth. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and external uncertainties.
