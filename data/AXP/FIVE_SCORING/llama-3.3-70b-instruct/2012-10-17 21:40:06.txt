American Express's Q3 earnings report showed a mixed bag of results, with revenue growth slowing down to 4% and net income growing at a slower pace than pretax income. However, the company demonstrated notable expense discipline, with operating expenses declining 2% year-over-year. The growth in billed business was slightly lower than the previous quarter, but the company's premium lending strategy and expansion into new markets, such as prepaid reloadables, are showing promise. The review of the ultimate redemption rate estimation process may lead to a charge in the fourth quarter, but the company's strong capital position and ability to control operating expenses are positives.
