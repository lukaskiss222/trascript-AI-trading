American Express's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company's revenue growth slowing due to a weakening economy, while management expressed caution about the outlook for 2009. The company is taking steps to reduce costs, build capital, and diversify its funding sources, including a new retail note program and CD program. However, the current economic environment and high LIBOR rates are expected to continue to pose challenges, and the company's guidance for 2009 is uncertain. Overall, while American Express is taking proactive steps to navigate the difficult environment, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and economic uncertainties.
