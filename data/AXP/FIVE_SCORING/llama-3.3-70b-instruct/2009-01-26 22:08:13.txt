American Express's Q4 earnings call revealed a challenging economic environment, with declining revenues and rising delinquencies. However, the company's brand strength and pricing power were evident in the stable average discount rate and growth in net card fees. Despite the short-term headwinds, management's focus on staying liquid, profitable, and investing selectively for long-term growth is a positive sign. The company's ability to raise $9 billion in retail CDs and its plans to continue growing deposits are also encouraging. Overall, while the near-term outlook is uncertain, American Express's strong brand and diversified business model position it well for long-term success.
