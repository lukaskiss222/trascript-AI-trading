American Express's Q3 earnings report revealed a mixed bag, with the company achieving record loan growth but facing headwinds from a strong US dollar, decreased average transaction sizes, and co-brand relationship changes. Despite these challenges, management remains focused on investing in growth initiatives, expanding card acceptance, and broadening relationships with card members. The company's guidance for 2015 EPS has been narrowed to $5.20-$5.35, and management is confident in their ability to return to positive earnings growth in 2016. Given the mixed results and ongoing challenges, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure.
