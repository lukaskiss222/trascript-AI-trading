American Express's Q4 earnings call revealed a solid performance, with 9% FX-adjusted billed business growth and 6% FX-adjusted revenue growth, driven by a modest uptick in the economy and the company's spend-centric business model. The company's strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses allowed for a 25% increase in full-year EPS. Management expressed confidence in the company's growth prospects, particularly in the digital space, and announced plans to create a joint venture to accelerate the transformation of its global business travel division.

The company's guidance for 2014 suggests a balanced approach to investments and shareholder returns, with a focus on delivering significant value to shareholders. The potential gain from the joint venture is expected to be material, although the exact amount is uncertain.

Overall, the call suggests a positive outlook for American Express, with a strong foundation for future growth and a commitment to delivering value to shareholders.
