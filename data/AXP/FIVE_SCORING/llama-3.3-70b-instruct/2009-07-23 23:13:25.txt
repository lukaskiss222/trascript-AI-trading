American Express's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving $342 million in earnings from continuing operations, despite an 18% decrease in total revenues. The managed and fx-adjusted revenue decline was 10%. Management reported a lower-than-expected write-off rate of 10%, driven by better-than-forecasted bankruptcy trends, and anticipates write-off rates to be below 10% in the next two quarters. The company plans to selectively increase marketing and promotions, and other business initiatives, which could positively impact the stock in the short term. However, the uncertain economic environment, rising unemployment, and potential regulatory changes may continue to weigh on the company's performance.
