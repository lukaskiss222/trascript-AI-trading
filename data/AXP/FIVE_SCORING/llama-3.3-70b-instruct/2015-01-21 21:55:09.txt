American Express reported solid Q4 and full-year 2014 results, with EPS growth of 15% and 14%, respectively. However, the company faces increasing challenges in 2015, including a strengthening U.S. dollar, intense competition in the co-brand space, and a heightened regulatory environment. The recent renewal of the Delta co-brand partnership is expected to have a negative impact on near-term economics, but is seen as a long-term positive. The company's restructuring efforts and cost-saving measures are expected to help offset some of the challenges. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key co-brand contracts.
