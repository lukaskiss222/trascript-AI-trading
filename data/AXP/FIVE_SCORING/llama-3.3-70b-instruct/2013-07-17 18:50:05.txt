American Express's Q2 2013 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company achieving record sales and net income, but also facing challenges in the European market due to regulatory pressures. The proposed European Commission caps on interchange fees are expected to have a direct impact on American Express's GNS business, but the company believes its proprietary business will not be affected. Management's tone was generally positive, with a focus on investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders. However, the company's guidance for the rest of the year was cautious, citing uncertainty around regulatory developments and economic conditions.
