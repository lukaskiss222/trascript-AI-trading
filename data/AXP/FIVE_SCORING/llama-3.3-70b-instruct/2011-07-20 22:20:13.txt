American Express's Q2 earnings report revealed strong revenue growth, driven by a 12% increase in total revenues and an 18% rise in Billed business. The company's focus on premium lending and its unique spend-centric business model have contributed to its success. However, the report also highlighted higher rewards costs, primarily due to increased customer engagement and redemption rates. Despite this, management expressed confidence in maintaining current financial targets while continuing to enhance the Membership Rewards program. The company plans to slow the growth of operating expenses as it exits the year and enters 2022, driven by revenue growth and expense flexibility.
