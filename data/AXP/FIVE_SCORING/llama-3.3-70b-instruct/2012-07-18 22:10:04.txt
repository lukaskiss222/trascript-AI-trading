American Express's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with total revenues increasing 5% year-over-year, but billed business growth slowing across all segments. The company's management sounded a cautious tone, citing an uncertain economic environment, but expressed confidence in their ability to drive long-term growth. Despite the slowing growth, American Express's credit performance remains strong, with write-off rates at historic lows. The company's expense management efforts are also yielding results, with total expenses growing only 2% year-over-year.

Given the mixed results and cautious management tone, I believe the stock will likely experience a negative impact in the short term, but the company's strong credit performance and expense management efforts will mitigate the decline.
