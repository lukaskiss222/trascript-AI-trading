American Express's Q3 earnings call indicated a stabilization in billed business, with monthly comparisons showing improvement, and credit trends continuing to show overall improvement. The company's charge card portfolio has performed well, with losses moderating and past due rates improving. However, lending write-offs, although declining, remain at historically high levels. Management plans to invest in initiatives that will position the company for growth over the medium to long term, focusing on premium lending strategies, expanding merchant acceptance, and enhancing customer service. The company's ability to navigate through difficult markets and its diversified business model are positives. Given the mixed signals and the cautious tone from management, the stock may experience short-term volatility but is likely to remain stable.
