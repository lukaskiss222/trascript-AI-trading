American Express's Q1 '09 earnings report reveals a mixed picture, with the company achieving positive earnings despite a challenging economic environment. However, revenue declined 18% year-over-year, and the company's provision for loan losses increased 49%. Management's tone was cautious, with a focus on controlling expenses and maintaining liquidity. The company's guidance for the remainder of 2009 was somewhat positive, with expectations of generating profits in excess of the dividend. Overall, the report suggests that American Express is navigating the difficult economic conditions relatively well, but the stock may face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key metrics.
