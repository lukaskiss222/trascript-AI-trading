American Express reported strong Q1 2011 earnings, driven by a 17% increase in Billed business and a 33% increase in income. The company's focus on premium lending and charge cards has led to high-quality customer acquisitions, resulting in strong spending growth and improved credit trends. Despite a decline in loan yields, American Express expects to achieve its long-term revenue growth target of 8%+ through investments in fee-based businesses and digital payments. The company plans to slow expense growth later in the year and into 2012, with a target of returning 50% of earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
