American Express's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with strong business growth and top-tier industry performance, but also a more difficult economic environment. The company's guidance for 2008 remains unchanged, with an expected EPS growth of 4% to 6%, despite higher credit losses and slower payment rates. Management's cautious tone and focus on balancing risk and profitability suggest a neutral short-term outlook.
