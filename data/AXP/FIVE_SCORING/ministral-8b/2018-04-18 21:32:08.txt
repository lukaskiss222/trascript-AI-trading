Based on the earnings transcript, American Express reported strong Q1 2018 results with revenue growth of 10% and EPS of $1.86, driven by solid performance across all segments. The company's focus on digital acceleration, increased merchant coverage, and strategic partnerships contributed to the growth. Management also highlighted the benefits of the new revenue recognition standard, which had a minimal impact on revenue growth rates and earnings. The company expects full-year revenue growth of at least 8% and EPS to be at the high end of its guidance range. Despite the positive results, analysts may be concerned about the potential impact of rising interest rates on net interest income and the Company's ability to maintain steady returns.
