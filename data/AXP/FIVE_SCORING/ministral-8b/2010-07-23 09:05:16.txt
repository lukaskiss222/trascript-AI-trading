**Analysis:**

American Express reported mixed results for Q2 2010, with revenue growth driven by higher card spending and travel commissions. However, net interest income declined due to the impact of the CARD Act and changes in customer behavior. The company also highlighted strong credit performance, with lower write-off rates and improved delinquency metrics. Additionally, American Express mentioned potential acquisitions in areas such as new fee revenues and alternative payments. The stock market's reaction to the earnings call could be mixed, with positive sentiment from analysts who view the company's strong credit performance and strategic investments as a positive signal. However, the uncertainty around the CARD Act and the potential for increased competition in the premium card market could weigh on the stock price.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, with analysts focusing on the company's strong credit performance and strategic investments. However, the uncertainty around the CARD Act and potential competition in the premium card market could lead to some volatility in the stock price.
