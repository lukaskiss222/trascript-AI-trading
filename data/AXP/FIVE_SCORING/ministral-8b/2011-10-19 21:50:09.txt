3. **Credit Performance**: Credit performance was excellent, with credit metrics at historic lows.
4. **Billed Business Growth**: Billed business growth was robust, with growth rates across all segments, although there was a slight decline in each segment compared to the second quarter.
5. **Regional Growth**: Growth was strong in Asia and Latin America, with Europe showing more softness.
6. **Lending Growth**: Lending growth was at 2%, with a spread between the growth in spending on lending products and the growth in loan balances due to a focus on premium lending.

8. **Capital Ratios**: Tier 1 common ratio remained at 12.3%, and the total payout ratio was 105% in the third quarter.

### Short-Term Implications

1. **Positive Impact**: The strong revenue growth, net income, and EPS, along with the excellent credit performance, suggest that American Express is well-positioned to navigate the economic uncertainty.
2. **Neutral Impact**: The slight decline in each segment's growth rate and the softness in Europe may cause some concern, but the overall growth rates are still robust.
3. **Negative Impact**: The 105% payout ratio and the fact that the company has not yet fully reloaded its share repurchase authorization could be seen as negative, but the strong financial performance mitigates this concern.

### Conclusion

The earnings call provided a mixed picture, with strong financial performance and some areas of concern. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, as the company's strong financial performance and growth rates should outweigh the concerns about the payout ratio and share repurchases.
