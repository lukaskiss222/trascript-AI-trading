### Analysis

American Express reported Q3 2015 earnings in line with expectations, but the results were impacted by a challenging economic environment and regulatory headwinds. The company's outlook for 2015 remains within the range of $5.20 to $5.35 EPS, with guidance for 2016 projected to return to positive earnings growth. Key points include:

1. **Earnings Impact**: The company experienced a 14% year-over-year decline in net income, primarily due to increased spending on growth initiatives, changes in co-brand relationships, and the stronger U.S. dollar.
2. **Growth Initiatives**: Significant spending on growth initiatives, particularly in technology and marketing, was highlighted as a key driver for future growth.
3. **Regulatory Environment**: The company continues to navigate a challenging regulatory environment, with FX headwinds and the impact of the Costco contract termination in 2016.
4. **Costco Impact**: The impact of the Costco contract termination on EPS is estimated to be 5% for the quarter, but the company remains optimistic about future growth opportunities.
5. **Loan Growth**: The company reported steady loan growth, with U.S. loans increasing by 7% during Q3.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the challenging economic environment and regulatory headwinds. The company's focus on growth initiatives and cost-saving measures may offer some relief in the long term, but the immediate outlook is likely to be impacted by the current economic conditions and regulatory pressures.
