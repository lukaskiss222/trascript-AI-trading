Based on the transcript, American Express reported strong financial results for Q4 2013 and full year 2013, with FX adjusted revenue growth of 6% and EPS of $4.88, up 25% year-over-year. The company also announced significant settlements with merchants and regulators, and discussed its plans for growth and strategic initiatives. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced 2014 guidance and uncertainty around the settlement agreements. However, the company's strong capital position, disciplined control of operating expenses, and focus on growth opportunities suggest long-term potential.
