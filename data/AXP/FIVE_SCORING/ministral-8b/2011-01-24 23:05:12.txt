### Analysis

The earnings call for American Express Company revealed several key points that will likely impact the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks:

1. **Revenue Growth**: The company reported a managed revenue growth of 4%, which was slightly below the 5% growth seen in the third quarter. This indicates a slowdown in revenue growth, which might be a concern for investors.

2. **Expenses**: The company's expenses grew significantly, with marketing and promotion expenses increasing by 14%. This higher spending is driven by strategic initiatives and investments in fee services. However, the company expects to dial back spending if the benefits from Visa and MasterCard payments end in 2011.

3. **Loan Growth**: Loans were down by 4% during the quarter, which is a significant headwind for revenue growth. The company expects loan growth to pick up in the future, but it will likely be at a slower pace than spending growth.

4. **Credit Performance**: Credit performance improved, with the write-off rate in the U.S. improving by 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year. This indicates a lower risk profile for the company.

5. **Capital Ratios**: The company's capital ratios are down somewhat from the third quarter, but they remain strong. The company expects to restart its share repurchase program in the second quarter if approved by the Fed.

6. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: The company expects regulatory and legislative initiatives to continue to impact its business. The Fed's proposals for debit interchange cuts could have implications for credit card interchange, but the company believes that competitive forces will drive the market.

### Conclusion

The earnings call highlighted several challenges and opportunities for American Express. The company's revenue growth slowed in the fourth quarter, and expenses grew significantly. However, the company's credit performance improved, and it expects to restart its share repurchase program in the second quarter. The company also expects to continue to invest in fee services and digital capabilities. Overall, the call suggests that the company is facing short-term headwinds but is well-positioned for long-term growth.
