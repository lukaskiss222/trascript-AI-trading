Based on the earnings transcript of American Express, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the following factors:

1. **Complexity in reported results**: The gain from the Business Travel joint venture and related incremental initiatives have made the reported results complex, which can lead to confusion and uncertainty among investors.
2. **Lower-than-expected loan growth**: While loan growth has picked up, it is still below expectations, which could indicate a slower recovery in consumer spending.
3. **Operating expenses**: The restructuring charge of $133 million and the incremental investments for growth initiatives have increased operating expenses, which could put pressure on earnings in the coming quarters.
4. **Potential legal challenges**: The ongoing trial with the DOJ could lead to additional uncertainty and potential legal costs, which could negatively impact the stock price.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative.
