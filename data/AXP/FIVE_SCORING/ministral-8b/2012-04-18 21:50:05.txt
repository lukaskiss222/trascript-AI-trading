**Analysis:**

American Express reported strong Q1 results, with revenue up 8% and EPS up 10%. The company highlighted growth in billed business, card-in-force, and average spending. However, the travel segment showed modest growth, and expenses increased by 4%. Management provided reassurance about the company's balance sheet and capital plans, with a focus on share buybacks and dividends.

**Short-term implications:**

1. **Positive impact:** The strong revenue growth and solid EPS indicate that American Express is well-positioned to weather the challenging economic environment. The company's investment in digital and Enterprise Growth initiatives suggests that it is poised for future growth.

2. **Neutral impact:** The slight increase in expenses and the modest growth in the travel segment could be seen as a headwind. However, management's focus on cost containment and the company's strong balance sheet suggest that these factors are manageable.

3. **Negative impact:** The potential for regulatory scrutiny and the uncertain economic environment could pose risks. Additionally, the company's high dividend payout ratio (56% in 2011) could leave it vulnerable to changes in interest rates.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong Q1 results, the company's focus on digital initiatives, and its solid balance sheet, American Express appears to be in a good position to maintain its growth trajectory. However, the potential risks from regulatory scrutiny and the uncertain economic environment warrant caution. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight positive bias.
