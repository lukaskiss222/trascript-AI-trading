### Analysis

The American Express earnings call for the second quarter of 2007 reveals a strong performance with 9% revenue growth and 13% increase in EPS. The company's focus on spend-driven growth and strategic investments in marketing and rewards programs is evident. However, the company faces near-term challenges due to higher interest expense and provision growth. Management is confident in the company's position within the affluent and high-spending cardmember sector and the broad growth opportunities within the payments industry. The company's ability to control expenses and manage growth effectively positions it for continued success.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience a **positive impact** over the next 1-2 weeks due to the strong earnings report and management's confidence in the company's growth prospects. The near-term challenges related to interest expense and provision growth are acknowledged but do not appear to significantly impact the overall positive outlook.

**Rating: 1**
