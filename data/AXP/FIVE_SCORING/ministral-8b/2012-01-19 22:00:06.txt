### Analysis

The American Express Company's Q4 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported strong revenue growth, particularly in the U.S., but faced challenges in Europe and a slowdown in growth compared to previous quarters. The management team highlighted their focus on cost containment and strategic growth, particularly in non-defense markets. The call also touched on potential acquisitions and the company's ongoing diversification efforts.

### Conclusion

Given the mixed performance and the management's tone, the stock is likely to experience short-term volatility. The company's strong revenue growth in the U.S. and cost containment measures are positive, but the slowdown in growth and the challenges in Europe may cause some uncertainty. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
