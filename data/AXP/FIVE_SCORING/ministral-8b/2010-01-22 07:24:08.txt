Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express Company (AXP) reported a mixed performance in the fourth quarter of 2009, with revenues and net income both improving year-over-year, but still below pre-recession levels. The company's guidance for 2010 projects a range of $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion in revenue and $0.55 to $0.65 in EPS. Management highlighted improvements in credit metrics, including lower provision levels and improved write-off rates, and emphasized the company's focus on premium lending and growth opportunities in the future. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the Card Act and its potential impact on net interest margin. However, the company's strong balance sheet, diversified business model, and focus on growth opportunities suggest long-term potential. The stock is currently trading at a discount to its historical valuation, and the company's management has a history of delivering strong returns to shareholders. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term volatility, but longer-term investors may find the stock to be an attractive investment opportunity.
