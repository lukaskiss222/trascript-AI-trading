Based on the provided transcript, American Express Company's earnings call provided mixed signals. The company reported strong revenue growth of 7% year-over-year, driven by robust cardmember spending across all segments and regions. However, expenses grew by 19%, primarily due to investments in sales force, technology, and enterprise growth. The company also noted that the net interest income decreased due to lower yields, which is expected to continue as the CARD Act becomes fully effective. The company's guidance for 2011 projects revenue growth of 7% to 9%, which is below the long-term target of 8% plus. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the elevated expense levels and the uncertainty around the CFDA and merchant settlement talks. However, the company's strong competitive position and unique business model suggest long-term potential.
