Based on the earnings transcript, American Express Company's stock price is likely to experience a short-term negative impact due to the following reasons:

1. **Lowered 2016 EPS Guidance**: The company has revised its 2016 EPS guidance downwards, which can lead to a temporary drop in the stock price.
2. **Challenging Economic Environment**: The company has acknowledged the challenging economic environment, which can negatively impact its financial performance.
3. **Regulatory Pressures**: The company is facing regulatory pressures, particularly in Europe, which can lead to increased costs and lower profitability.
4. **Costco Portfolio Sale**: The company has not yet finalized the sale of its Costco portfolio, which can create uncertainty in the market.
5. **Accelerated Cost Reductions**: The company has announced plans to accelerate cost reductions, which can lead to temporary layoffs and reduced spending, potentially impacting customer service and growth.

Given these factors, it is likely that American Express Company's stock price will experience a short-term negative impact. However, the company's long-term growth prospects and strong balance sheet may provide support for the stock price in the longer term.
