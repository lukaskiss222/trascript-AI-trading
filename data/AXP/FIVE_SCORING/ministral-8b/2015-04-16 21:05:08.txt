### Analysis

The American Express earnings call for Q1 2015 highlighted a solid performance with 11% EPS growth, driven by strong revenue growth and disciplined cost controls. The company's core underlying performance was bolstered by a 5% revenue growth rate after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year. The key drivers of this growth included the expansion of the OptBlue program, the launch of the Plenti loyalty coalition program, and the signing of new cobrand relationships.

However, the call also noted the impact of the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which depressed growth by nearly four percentage points. The company expects a similar drag in the second quarter due to FX rates. The termination of the Costco Canada relationship also had a significant impact on billed business, with a more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year and slower retail sales growth.

Management provided a cautious outlook for the second quarter, anticipating more uneven earnings performance due to the preferred share issuances and the prior year's business travel joint venture transaction gain. The company's full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged, with expectations for flat to modestly down EPS growth.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the company's solid Q1 performance and the positive outlook for growth initiatives. However, the stock may face some downward pressure due to the expected FX headwinds and the uncertainty surrounding the Costco Canada relationship. Overall, the stock is likely to see a moderate impact in the next 1-2 weeks.
