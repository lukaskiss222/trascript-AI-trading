The earnings call for American Express Company provided a detailed overview of the company's performance in the first quarter of 2016. The key takeaways include:

1. **Financial Performance**: American Express reported a 6% decline in net income compared to the prior year, driven by higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain, which were offset by a higher level of investment spending and a modest restructuring charge. The company's earnings per share (EPS) was $1.45 for Q1, which was 2% below the prior year.

2. **Segment Performance**: The company's Global Commercial Services (GCS) and International Consumer and Network Services (ICNS) segments both showed growth, with GCS volumes growing faster among small and middle-market businesses compared to global and large customers. ICNS volume growth was driven by strong Global Network Services (GNS) growth and the lapping of the end of the Costco relationship in Canada.

3. **Loan Performance**: The company's GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 2015, reflecting the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held-for-sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. Adjusted U.S. Card Member loans were up 12% versus the prior year, outpacing the industry.

4. **Revenue Performance**: Reported revenues were up 2%, growing by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco-related revenues and a larger than usual decline in the reported discount rate.

5. **Credit Performance**: Provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Adjusted provision increased by 12% when excluding credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios.

6. **Expenses**: Total expenses were up 5%, growing by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending.

7. **Capital Performance**: The company returned 99% of the capital it generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios.

8. **Outlook**: The company's outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share was between $5.40 and $5.70, and for full year 2017 earnings per share was at least $5.60. The company expects higher earnings per share during Q2 due to the portfolio sale gain, and lower earnings during the second half of the year as the relationship with Costco ends and the company continues to invest at elevated levels.

The call highlighted the company's progress in accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments, and resetting its cost base. However, the company also acknowledged that there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. The company's focus on strategic growth and managing defense market uncertainties suggests long-term potential, but the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion**: The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative, with a rating of -1.
