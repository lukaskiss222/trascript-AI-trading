### Analysis:

The earnings call for American Express Company revealed a mixed performance in the second quarter of 2016. The company reported solid results, including a 37% increase in net income and a 7% reduction in average share count due to share buybacks. However, the results were complicated by the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio, which resulted in a $232 million restructuring charge and a decline in billed business and revenue growth rates. The company also repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count. Despite these complexities, the company's underlying results were solid and consistent with the outlook provided at the Investor Day in March.

### Short-Term Implications:

1. **Costco Impact**: The sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio had a significant impact on the company's results, leading to a sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates. This impact is expected to continue in the second half of 2016, which could put downward pressure on the stock price in the short term.

2. **Share Buybacks**: The company's share buybacks during the quarter helped to reduce the average share count and drive EPS growth. This positive action could provide some support to the stock price in the short term.

3. **Credit and Expense Performance**: The company's credit performance remained stable, and expense performance was impacted by the Costco portfolio sale and restructuring charges. The company expects to see an increase in provision and expenses in the second half of 2016, which could put downward pressure on the stock price.

4. **Guidance for 2017**: The company's guidance for 2017 remains unchanged, with adjusted EPS expected to be at least $5.60. However, the company expects to see a sequential increase in revenue growth rates in the second half of 2016, which could provide some support to the stock price.

### Conclusion:

Given the mixed performance and the complexities surrounding the Costco portfolio sale, the short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be negative. The company's share buybacks and positive credit performance may provide some support, but the overall impact is likely to be negative.
