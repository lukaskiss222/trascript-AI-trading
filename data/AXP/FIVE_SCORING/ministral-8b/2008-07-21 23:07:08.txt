The earnings call for American Express highlights a challenging economic environment with significant impacts on consumer spending and credit performance. Key points include:

1. **Economic Impact**: The U.S. economy has weakened significantly, leading to a slowdown in consumer spending and higher credit losses.
2. **Credit Performance**: Higher write-offs and roll rates indicate a deteriorating credit environment, particularly in the U.S. consumer segment.
3. **Reserve Levels**: American Express has increased its reserves to 135% of past due owned loans, indicating a cautious approach to managing credit risk.
4. **Segment Performance**: International consumer and global commercial services have shown strong performance, partially offsetting the weaker U.S. consumer segment.
