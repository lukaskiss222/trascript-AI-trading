Based on the earnings transcript, American Express reported strong earnings growth, driven by disciplined control of operating expenses, share repurchases, and a strong balance sheet. The company's revenue growth, however, was below expectations due to the impact of the business travel joint venture and FX adjustments. The company also highlighted the potential impact of the Apple Pay launch and the pending loss of its relationship with Costco in Canada. Overall, the company's performance was mixed, with positive elements such as strong EPS growth and a solid balance sheet, but also concerns such as potential impacts from currency fluctuations and the Apple Pay launch. Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
