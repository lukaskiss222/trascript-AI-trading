**Analysis:**

The earnings call for American Express Company (AXP) reveals a mixed financial picture. The company reported a strong performance in 2014, with EPS growth of 14% and a 15% increase in billings. However, the company faces several challenges in 2015, including a strengthening U.S. dollar, intense competition in the co-brand space, and heightened regulatory environment. The company's strategic decisions, such as the renewal of its Delta partnership and the sale of its investment in Concur, suggest a focus on long-term growth and flexibility.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the earnings call and the company's strategic initiatives, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong performance in 2014 and its focus on long-term growth should provide some support to the stock price. However, the challenges in 2015, including the strengthening U.S. dollar and intense competition, may put some downward pressure on the stock price. Overall, the stock is likely to experience modest fluctuations in the short term.
