### Analysis:

American Express reported strong Q4 and full-year earnings, with revenue growth of 10% and EPS of $7.33, which was a 24% increase over the prior year. The company's strategic imperatives, including expanding leadership in the premium consumer space, building on commercial payments, and strengthening its global network, drove these results. However, the company noted that the lapping effect from the 2018 step-up in spending and the impact of regulatory changes in the EU and Australia may lead to a deceleration in growth rates. The company expects 8% to 10% revenue growth and EPS of $7.85 to $8.35 for 2019, assuming a stable economic environment. The company also discussed its strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines, Marriott, and Hilton, as well as its plans to expand its merchant coverage globally and leverage its integrated payments model. Overall, the company's strong performance and strategic initiatives suggest a positive outlook for the company's stock in the short term.

### Conclusion:

Based on the earnings call, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong performance and strategic initiatives. The company's strategic partnerships and plans to expand its merchant coverage globally suggest that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Additionally, the company's strong performance in the premium consumer space and commercial payments suggests that the company is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory. However, the company's guidance for 2019 is relatively conservative, which may limit the potential for a significant stock price increase in the short term.
