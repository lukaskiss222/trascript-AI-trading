The company continues to see robust consumer spending and growth in international markets, while commercial spending, particularly from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains soft. Management reaffirmed their full-year guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and $12.65 to $13.15 EPS. The call also highlighted the company's strategy to grow its premium consumer base in the U.S., win the recovery in the U.S. small business space, and expand internationally.

### Short-term Impact on Stock Price

Given the strong Q1 results and the reaffirmation of guidance, AMEX's stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term. The company's focus on premium consumers and international growth, combined with the continued strong consumer spending, suggests that the stock may rally. However, the softness in commercial spending, particularly from SMEs, might temper the stock's performance. The overall positive outlook and the reaffirmation of guidance are likely to outweigh any concerns related to commercial spending, leading to a positive impact on the stock price.
