The American Express Company's earnings call for Q2 2011 revealed strong performance across various segments, with significant growth in billed business and improved credit metrics. The company achieved its long-term revenue growth target, even after adjusting for foreign exchange impacts. However, the growth in rewards expense, driven by increased customer engagement and higher redemption rates, raised concerns about the sustainability of these gains. The company also noted the impact of the Visa-MasterCard payments, which will end in the fourth quarter, and the need to adjust marketing and promotion spending to maintain profitability. Overall, the call provided mixed signals, with positive revenue growth and improved credit trends offset by increased expenses and the end of the Visa-MasterCard payments. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding the Visa-MasterCard payments and the potential impact of increased rewards expenses on profitability.
