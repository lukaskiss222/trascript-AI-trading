American Express reported mixed results for Q1 2008, with revenue growth but lower income due to higher marketing spending and a challenging US credit environment. The company's management highlighted the benefits of diversification and strategic investments, while also addressing the potential impact of the economic downturn. The stock is likely to face short-term volatility due to the mixed results and the uncertain economic environment. However, the company's strong performance and strategic positioning suggest long-term potential.
