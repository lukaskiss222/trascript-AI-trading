American Express is navigating a severe economic downturn that has visibly impacted its core business segments like consumer and travel spending, yet the company reported some resilient areas including premium pricing stability and a strong brand appeal that has bolstered deposit growth.

However, the negative economic trends and reduced spending are expected to apply downward pressure on the stock in the immediate aftermath of the earnings call.
