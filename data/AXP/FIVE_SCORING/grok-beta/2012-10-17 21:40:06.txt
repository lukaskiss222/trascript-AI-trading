American Express reported mixed third-quarter earnings, with revenue growth slowing to 4%, or 5% FX-adjusted, despite higher net interest income from 6% loan growth. EPS growth of 6% was driven by a share buyback program, but challenges include a slightly declining growth rate in billed business, concerns around the potential for increased MR (Membership Rewards) liability, and the uncertain impact of future regulatory actions. The company also experienced a meaningful decline in travel commissions and fees due to lower T&E spending. These factors suggest a cautious approach to the stock in the short term. However, their expense discipline and high return on equity provide some optimism.
