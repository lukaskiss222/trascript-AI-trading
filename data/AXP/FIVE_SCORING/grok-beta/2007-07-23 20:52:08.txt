American Express demonstrated strong revenue and earnings growth, robust spending on proprietary cards, and controlled credit quality in Q2 2007. The company's effective use of seasonal variations to focus marketing investments on key initiatives increases the likelihood of at least maintaining the positive momentum. However, higher interest and provision expenses pose short-term challenges, potentially moderating any significant positive impact on the stock price. Given these factors, I expect a slight positive impact on the stock price in the immediate 1-2 weeks post-earnings, as the market digests the mixed performance.
