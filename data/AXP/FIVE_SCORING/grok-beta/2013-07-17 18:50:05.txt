The percentage growth opportunity in China, new partner signings, and product launches indicate positive growth prospects for American Express's Global Network Services (GNS) segment, potentially offsetting the negative implications of the European Union draft proposal that targets interchange fees among four-party payment systems. Although some uncertainty is introduced by the draft proposal, American Expressâ€™s proprietary business remains unaffected, and the company has experience in adjusting to similar regulatory changes globally suggesting a potential neutral to positive stock movement.
