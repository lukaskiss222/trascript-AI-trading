American Expressâ€™s Q3 call indicated a cautious approach to future expectations, with the management anticipating weaker consumer and business sentiment into 2009. While the company has taken steps to strengthen its liquidity and funding, the near 3% EPS drop, conservative growth forecasts, higher credit losses, and plans for cost reduction suggest potential short-term pressure on the stock. However, their strong ROE and strategic measures to build capital and navigate through economic challenges might temper any severe negative impact.
