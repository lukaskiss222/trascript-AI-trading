American Express's Q3 earnings call shows a mixed bag of results. Revenue was down, but there are signs of stabilization in billing with volumes improving on a month-to-month basis. Credit metrics are showing signs of improvement, although they remain high, and there are indications of cautious optimism with plans for incremental investment in growth-enhancing activities. The company's focus on premium spending, alongside concerns about the economy and the impact of the Card Act, suggests a slight positive impact on stock price as the market could react favorably to the stabilization of spending and potential for recovery, but tempered by economic uncertainties.
