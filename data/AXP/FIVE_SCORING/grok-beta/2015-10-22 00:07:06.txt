The earnings call for American Express indicated a challenging environment with pressures from a stronger U.S. dollar, changes in co-brand partnerships, and a focus on growth initiatives affecting short-term earnings. Although the company anticipates returning to positive EPS growth in 2016, current headwinds and the ongoing costs associated with acquiring new accounts suggest a potential negative stock price reaction in the near term.
