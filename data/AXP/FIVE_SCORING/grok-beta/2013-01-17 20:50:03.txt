American Expressâ€™s Q4 performance showed operational adjustments such as a restructuring charge and tightened focus on operating expense growth to less than 3% over the next two years. However, the mention of specific contra-revenue items, cost-cutting measures, and a slight revenue growth of 5% suggest to some degree of concern, but potential for stabilization and positive growth implications. Given that the company maintains healthy capital ratios, robust lending credit performance, and no impact from fiscal changes in the quarter, the stock is likely to have a positive short-term reaction.
