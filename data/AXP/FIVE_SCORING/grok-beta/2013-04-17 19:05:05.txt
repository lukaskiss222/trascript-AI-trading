American Express's Q1 2013 earnings reveal a positive performance with total revenues growing 4% on a reported basis and 5% FX-adjusted, while maintaining a strong capital position and continuing their focus on premium lending products. The company's ability to manage expenses effectively, with operating expenses growing only 1% versus the prior year, suggests resilience in a sluggish economy. However, concerns about potential delays in consumer spending recovery and the impact of not pursuing aggressive promotions with teaser rates could affect short-term revenue momentum, though the company's conservative approach to loan growth indicates its confidence in creditworthiness. Overall, with a steady, though modest EPS growth and no immediate negative impact highlighted, the short-term (1-2 weeks) outlook on the stock price should remain positive.
