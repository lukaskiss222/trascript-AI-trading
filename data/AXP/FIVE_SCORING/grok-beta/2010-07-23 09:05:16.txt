American Express reported a solid earnings performance beating expectations, which instills confidence in the short-term outlook. Their focus on increasing billings, effectively managing credit performance, and launching new product features like Revolution Money to capture the alternative payment space, indicates a positive growth momentum. Despite downplaying the immediate impact of certain regulatory changes like the Durbin amendment, the management's proactive approach towards adapting to evolving market conditions and ongoing investments in marketing and customer acquisition are promising. These efforts, combined with a currently low unemployment rate impacting spending positively, suggest the stock will likely react positively in the near term.
