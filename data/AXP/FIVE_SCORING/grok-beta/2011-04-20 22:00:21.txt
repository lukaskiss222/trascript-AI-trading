American Express reported a strong quarter with earnings growth of 33%, EPS at $0.97, and a Return on Equity of 28%. Yet, significant investments in marketing, rewards increases, and concerns over regulatory and economic uncertainties might prompt investors to remain cautious. Their strong billing growth and focus on premium customer acquisition could support positive sentiments over time, but the expense management plans towards the end of 2011 and into 2012 might offset short-term reactions. The stock could face a slight negative impact in the short term due to these uncertainties despite a robust financial performance.
