American Express's Q1 2014 earnings reveal strong earnings per share growth, driven by disciplined expense control and near-historical low write-off rates. Despite modest revenue growth deceleration primarily in the U.S. due to weather and seasonal trends, and a slight rise in effective tax rate, the company showed flexibility in hitting on average targets with robust capital planning and share repurchases. Strategic steps like the OptBlue program and product expansions suggest positive growth prospects, potentially supporting a short-term positive stock impact.
