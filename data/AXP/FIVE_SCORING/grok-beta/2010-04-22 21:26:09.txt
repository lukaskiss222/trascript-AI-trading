American Express reported a strong quarter with significant billed business growth, surpassing expectations, especially for March. The company's focus on charge card and premium lending products, a positive spending trend in affluent customer segments, and controlled credit losses suggest potential for positive investor reactions. However, uncertainties remain due to the economic environment and regulatory changes like the Card Act, which may affect future yields and profits. Overall, the cautious optimism from management, improved credit performance, and strategic business investments suggest a positive stock price impact in the short term.
