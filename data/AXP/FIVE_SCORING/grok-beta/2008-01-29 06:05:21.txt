American Express's 2007 Q4 earnings call reveals a mixed outlook. While the company reported strong revenue growth and continued investment in key growth initiatives, it faced significant headwinds from higher credit-related charges and a substantial increase in the membership rewards liability. The projected EPS growth for 2008 of only 4% to 6% and the focus on a "moderately weaker U.S. economy" suggest cautious optimism about the short-term economic outlook. Comments regarding a sudden drop in billed business growth, tightening credit conditions, and pulling back on discretionary spending could lead to short-term headwinds for the stock.
