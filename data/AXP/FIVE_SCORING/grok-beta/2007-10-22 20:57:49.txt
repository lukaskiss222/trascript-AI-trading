American Express delivered strong quarterly earnings with a 18% increase in diluted EPS, high revenue growth, and continued investment in marketing and customer acquisition. Despite these positives, potential concerns include higher interest expense due to expiring hedges, and increasing provisions for loan losses, which might reflect caution about future credit quality. However, management's confidence in the affluent customer base, their focus on international growth, and a continued commitment to share repurchases and dividends suggest stability. The stock is likely to experience some positive momentum due to the earnings beat but the impact might be tempered by the higher funding costs and provision increases.
