American Express's Q2 2015 earnings call highlighted solid core performance amidst challenges such as foreign exchange impacts, changes in co-brand partnerships, and legal issues impacting merchant steering. However, the company's focus on growth initiatives and maintaining disciplined expense control, coupled with ongoing international expansion and new loyalty programs like Plenti, indicate positive momentum. The renewed emphasis on marketing investment in the second half of the year is likely to reinforce the company's growth strategy, balancing out some EPS volatility, potentially leading to positive short-term stock price movement.
