American Express reported lower than expected earnings growth for 2016 and 2017, projecting a modest EPS increase partly offset by a significant business transformation involving the sale of its Costco portfolio. The company's strategic moves include cost reduction efforts of $1 billion to adjust to lower revenue growth, providing insight into its concern about near-term profitability due to restructuring costs. Short-term stock pressure is anticipated due to anticipated restructuring charges and uncertainties around strategic shifts.
