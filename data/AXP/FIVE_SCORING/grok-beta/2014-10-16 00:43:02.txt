American Express reported solid earnings growth with EPS up 12% despite flat revenue growth, which suggests effective cost management and positive contributions from various strategic initiatives. The company's focus on non-traditional segments like Apple Pay participation and strategic investments like in Concur, alongside steady growth in billed business (especially in China), should provide positive short-term momentum. However, the potential headwind from declining gas prices and currency fluctuations might temper some of the enthusiasm. Overall, these developments should generally be received well by the market in the next week or so. [1]
