American Express's Q4 earnings revealed a return to modest year-over-year revenue growth and improved credit metrics hinting at a recovery, which may support short-term stock price stability or a slight uptick. However, the company's cautious outlook due to ongoing economic challenges like unemployment, higher marketing and reward costs in line with strategic growth initiatives, and regulatory concerns could temper investor enthusiasm. The CFO provided conservative guidance suggesting potential challenges on profitability from increased marketing spend, credit card act implications, and lower interest yields, which might put short-term pressure on the stock price.
