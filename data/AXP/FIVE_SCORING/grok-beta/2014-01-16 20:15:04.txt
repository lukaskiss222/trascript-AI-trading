The American Express Company's Q4 2013 earnings call highlighted solid performance with healthy billed business growth, intense revenue growth, and disciplined expense management, leading to an EPS growth of 25% for the year. However, the announcement of a settlement related to class actions and card member reimbursements could be perceived as a negative, impacting EPS by $0.04. Given the generally favorable comments, valuation could potentially remain stable. The market seems to have already absorbed most of the negative news, so near-term, a negative PR impact might be limited.
