American Express reported a strong third quarter with revenue growth and solid consumer spending, particularly in airline travel. Despite potential regulatory pressures from the CARD Act, Dodd-Frank, and the DOJ lawsuit, management indicated these initiatives are less likely to impact Amex's charge and co-brand products significantly. However, the prospect of merchants steering consumers towards debit or other lower-cost credit products could affect Amex negatively. Still, the company's focus on premium customer service, growth in network use, and high spending value proposition is expected to continue supporting its stock in the near-term.
