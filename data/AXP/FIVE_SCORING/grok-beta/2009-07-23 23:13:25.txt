American Express reported lower billings, earnings, and net income for Q2 2009, significantly impacted by lower consumer spending, higher credit losses, and unemployment. Despite these headwinds, the company has indicated a slight moderation in the decline of spending in recent months and plans to selectively increase marketing and promotions in the second half of the year, suggesting some optimism. However, considering the ongoing economic challenges, regulatory pressures, and the need for continued credit provision, the stock might experience minor pressure in the short term.
