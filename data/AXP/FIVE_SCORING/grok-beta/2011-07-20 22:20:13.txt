American Express reported a robust second quarter with record billed business, strong revenue growth, and impressive performance in both consumer and commercial segments. The investments in rewards programs are enhancing customer engagement, although this increases short-term costs. While the company is addressing cost concerns and plans to slow expense growth, positive trends in billing, spending, and credit performance suggest a potential positive impact on the stock. However, the market might react cautiously due to elevated expenses and potential revenue growth concerns related to the cessation of Visa-MasterCard payments.
