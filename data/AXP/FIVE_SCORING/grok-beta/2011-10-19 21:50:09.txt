AmEx reported a robust third quarter with strong revenue growth and EPS that outperformed expectations. However, the positive impact on the stock might be tempered by the elevated levels of credit provision releases, a disputed tax credit, and the timing of MacroVisa/MasterCard settlement benefit, which may not be sustained. Given this, investors might view the results skeptically due to concerns about the sustainability of earnings and the company's cautious outlook on operating expenses. This could lead to a neutral short-term impact on stock price while investors await more definitive signs of sustainable growth and earnings stability.
