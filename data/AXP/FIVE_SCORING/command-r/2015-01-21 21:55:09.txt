The Q4 earnings call reveals a complex situation. While AmEx demonstrated disciplined cost control and strong capital positioning, with EPS growth within target, several challenges emerged. The strengthening US dollar negatively impacted international revenue, and the competitive environment for co-brand partnerships grew intense. The Delta co-brand agreement's renewal came with a hefty upfront cost, impacting short-term profitability. Alongside this, a slowing global economy, regulatory pressures, and intensifying competition add to the company's woes. The stock is likely to experience negative pressure in the short term.
