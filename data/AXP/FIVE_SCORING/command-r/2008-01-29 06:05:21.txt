American Express's Q4 results were impacted by various credit-related provisions and adjusting items. While the company demonstrated resilience in some areas, such as international credit quality and B2B sectors, the overall tone of the earnings call pointed towards caution amidst economic uncertainty. Management's focus on cost control and withdrawal of discretionary spending reflects a more conservative approach for 2008. The stock is likely to experience some downward pressure in the short term due to the challenging economic environment and uncertainties about consumer spending and credit quality.
