American Express's Q2 earnings transcript reveals robust billed business and revenue growth, underpinned by broad-based spending increases and a strong international performance. While rewards expenses grew significantly, management attributed this to enhanced customer engagement and program improvements. The company's strategy to invest in the business is reflected in elevated expenses, but plans to slow expense growth offer optimism. The stock is likely to witness a positive impact in the short term.
