American Express's Q3 results demonstrated the company's resilience in a challenging environment. While billed business and cards in force grew, credit performance declined due to the economy. The company's proactive measures, such as modifying funding sources and implementing cost-cutting strategies, are positive steps. The stock will likely experience a short-term dip due to the uncertain economy and elevated LIBOR rates' impact on margins. However, Amex's strong brand, diverse business model, and focus on cost management should help navigate the hardships.
