American Express' Q3 results reflected challenges related to co-brand partnerships, a strong US dollar, and increased spending on growth initiatives. While these headwinds are expected to persist into Q4, the company's long-term prospects remain intact. Notably, the management's focus on international growth, technological advancements, and cost-cutting measures are positive indicators. The recent impairment charge is a one-off event, and the company's capital position remains strong. Despite the complex environment, AmEx is investing in growth, frutoing increased new card acquisitions. The stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to these challenges, but the underlying fundamentals appear intact.
