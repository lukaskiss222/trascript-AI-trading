American Express's recent earnings call reveals the company's resilience in the face of economic uncertainty. Their billed business and revenue growth, along with impressive credit performance, indicate a strong quarter. While marketing expenses are higher, disciplined cost control and the absence of major disruptions show a well-managed operation. The company's strategic initiatives, including a joint venture for global business travel and a focus on digital opportunities, position it for long-term growth. The shutdown's potential impact on the economy is a minor concern, but overall, the stock should see a positive reaction in the short term.
