The upcoming weeks will see volatility in American Express's stock price as the market digests the earnings call. The company's lower than expected growth rates and reduced 2016 guidance will likely lead to a negative stock response in the short term. The call revealed a cautious outlook, attributed to external factors like a strong dollar, regulatory pressures, and increased competition. The decision to invest in growth initiatives while managing costs may soothe investor worries about the company's long-term trajectory, but it does little to alleviate short-term concerns.
