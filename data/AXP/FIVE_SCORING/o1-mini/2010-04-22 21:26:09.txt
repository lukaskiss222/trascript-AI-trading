American Express reported a significant increase in EPS by 128%, driven by strong billed business and improved credit performance despite a slight decline in revenue when adjusted for foreign exchange. Management emphasized strategic investments in marketing and diversification, along with robust growth in charge cards and travel sales, indicating confidence in sustaining growth. However, concerns about net interest yield declines and external economic uncertainties may temper the immediate positive sentiment.
