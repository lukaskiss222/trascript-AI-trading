American Express reported solid revenue growth but experienced a decline in net income and EPS, reflecting increased credit losses and higher expenses amid a challenging economic environment. Management's cautious tone and lowered guidance may heighten investor concerns in the short term. Consequently, the stock is likely to face a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
