American Express reported strong third-quarter results with 10% adjusted revenue growth and a 25% increase in EPS year-over-year. The raised full-year EPS guidance, resumed share buybacks, and strategic expansions in digital partnerships like PayPal indicate positive momentum. Despite some margin pressures, the overall performance and optimistic outlook are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
