American Express's Q1 2013 earnings call demonstrates strong financial performance, exceeding expectations in certain key metrics (revenue, net income, EPS).  Management highlights continued low credit loss ratios and robust billed business growth despite a slow growth economy.  While guidance is positive, the call emphasizes the ongoing need to maintain tight expense control, indicating potential pressure on share price if the stated growth trajectory doesn't materialize.
