American Express' Q3 2024 earnings call signaled continued strength and a commitment to growth.  Management affirmed a positive outlook, raising full-year EPS guidance and highlighting the ongoing success of product refreshes, particularly the enhanced Gold card, which is resonating with younger demographics.  The call also emphasized the increasing importance of dining as a spending category and the strategic investments in that area through acquisitions like Resy.  Positive trends in international and card member retention further solidify a positive outlook, but the potential for further accelerating billings will be critical to surpass the company's revenue growth goals.
