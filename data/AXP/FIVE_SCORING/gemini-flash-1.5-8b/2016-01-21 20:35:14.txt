American Express's earnings call reveals a shift in strategy, driven by a more cautious outlook for 2016 and 2017.  While the company achieved consistent adjusted revenue growth, management highlighted evolving economic and competitive pressures, with a particularly noted deceleration in the corporate sector.  A significant focus on accelerating revenue growth and aggressively reducing costs to the tune of $1 billion by 2017 is now in place.
