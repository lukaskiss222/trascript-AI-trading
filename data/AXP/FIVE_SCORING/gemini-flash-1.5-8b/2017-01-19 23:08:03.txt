American Express's Q4 2016 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong performance in the international consumer segment (double-digit growth) and particularly the expansion of lending products for existing cardholders.  Management highlighted a successful shift away from Costco, with strong performance in the small business and middle market segments.  While overall revenue growth was moderate, the company's positive outlook for 2017, projecting earnings between $5.60 and $5.80 per share, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
