American Express' Q3 2022 earnings call highlights very strong performance across all segments, exceeding expectations.  Management emphasizes continued robust spending trends, particularly in travel and entertainment, and sees this as a tailwind, not a cyclical bubble, driven by the strong demand and increased engagement with various services and benefits offered.  This resilience bodes well for the next 1-2 weeks, with likely positive investor sentiment and a stock price rally.
