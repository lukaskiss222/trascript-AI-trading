American Express's Q4 2011 earnings transcript shows strong results despite a globally challenging economic environment.  Billed business growth is slightly below prior quarter levels, but still impressive, with international growth slowing most significantly. Management highlights continued investments and a focus on high-value customers, although acknowledging the ongoing economic uncertainty.  The company's strategy appears to be positioned for long-term growth, making any short-term impact minimal to moderately positive.
