American Express's Q2 2013 earnings call indicates a robust quarter with strong revenue growth (4% reported, 5% FX adjusted excluding reimbursements) and healthy profitability.  Management highlighted positive trends in billed business and loan growth, particularly in the Global Network Services (GNS) segment.  However, the call also emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the European Commission's draft proposal regarding interchange fees, potentially impacting GNS in the future.  This uncertain regulatory climate is likely to create some short term volatility in the stock.
