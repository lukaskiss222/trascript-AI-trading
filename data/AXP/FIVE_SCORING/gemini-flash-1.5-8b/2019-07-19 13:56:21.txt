American Express's Q1 2019 earnings call highlights robust growth, driven by strong consumer spending and a balanced mix of fee and loan revenue.  Management reaffirmed guidance and expressed confidence in the company's strategy, particularly the expansion of its B2B offerings and focus on digital integration.  The call also noted that the company is seeing healthy credit performance, and while CECL will impact provision expense, the current economic environment is viewed as stable. This combination suggests continued positive short-term momentum for the stock.
