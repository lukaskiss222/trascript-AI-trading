American Express's Q3 2014 earnings transcript reveals strong EPS growth (12%) outpacing revenue (6%) due to disciplined expense control and share repurchases.  Management highlights positive loan growth, low credit metrics, and progress with OptBlue, Concur (acquisition pending) and Apple Pay strategies. The company is optimistic about maintaining positive momentum despite a challenging global economic outlook and the absence of business travel revenue.  This indicates a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
