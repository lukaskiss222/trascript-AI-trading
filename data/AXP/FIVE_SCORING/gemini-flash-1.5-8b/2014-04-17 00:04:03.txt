American Express's Q1 2014 earnings call indicates a solid performance, exceeding EPS growth targets despite slightly slower revenue growth.  Management highlighted disciplined expense control, low write-offs, and strong capital position as key drivers.  The call suggests continued investment in strategic initiatives like OptBlue and Amex EveryDay for future growth, potentially offsetting a dip in short-term revenues.
