American Express's Q1 2017 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth, exceeding internal projections due to a particularly strong March.  Management attributed this to a mix of successful cost-cutting efforts, a shift in customer mix towards higher-yield segments, and the continued appeal of their products, especially to younger consumers.  While international growth is seen as a key strength, short-term impacts from various factors like potential tax reform uncertainties and the sequential impacts of leap day and Easter are also part of the discussion.
