American Express's earnings call highlights significant concerns about the worsening economic climate.  Management anticipates further deterioration in consumer and business sentiment, leading to weaker spending and loan growth, with a potential rise in their credit loss rates. Increased funding costs and a negative outlook from rating agencies are also significant concerns.  Though the company maintains that it is well-positioned for liquidity, the negative outlook suggests a potential short-term hesitation for investors.
