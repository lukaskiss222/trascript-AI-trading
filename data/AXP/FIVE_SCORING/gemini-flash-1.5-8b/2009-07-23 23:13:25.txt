American Express' Q2 2009 earnings show a significant decline in revenue due to the economic downturn, but management highlights a moderation in spending declines in June and July.  Improved bankruptcy trends and a better-than-expected roll rate from current to 30-day past due accounts suggest potentially lower credit losses in the coming quarters. Management's focus on improving credit metrics, cost-cutting measures, and a willingness to reinvest provision benefits in targeted marketing efforts point towards a cautious but potentially positive outlook for the next 1-2 weeks.
