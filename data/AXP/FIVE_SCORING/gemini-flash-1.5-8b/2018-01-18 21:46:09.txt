American Express' earnings call highlighted strong Q4 2017 performance, exceeding revenue and earnings expectations despite tax act impacts.  Management emphasized continued momentum across segments, particularly in billings and loans. Guidance for 2018 suggests revenue growth in the 7-8% range, although the discount rate is expected to decline further, and the company plans to invest more in customer-facing initiatives.  The lowered capital returns are prudent in the face of a large tax-related loss, which the firm expects to recover faster with a lower tax rate going forward and anticipates higher earnings.
