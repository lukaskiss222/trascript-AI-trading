American Express's Q2 2020 earnings call highlighted a gradual recovery in spending, with non-T&E categories improving faster than travel.  Management expressed confidence in managing credit risk, despite a significant reserve build. The call, while acknowledging the pandemic's impact, emphasized the company's strong capital position and the resilience of its customers, especially small businesses.  This suggests a likely positive, but cautious, short-term trend, with the stock potentially rallying while investors await further economic data.
