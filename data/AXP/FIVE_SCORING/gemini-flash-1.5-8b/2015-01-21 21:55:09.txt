American Express' earnings call highlights a strong full-year performance, exceeding EPS targets and returning substantial capital.  However, short-term pressures exist from a weakening international currency environment, decreased billing growth (though FX-adjusted figures are positive), and the impact of lower gas prices.  The restructuring and investment decisions, driven by the gain on the Concur sale, suggest a strategic shift to drive long-term growth.  Thus, short term weakness is more predicted, followed by long-term potential.
