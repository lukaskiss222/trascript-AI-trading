American Express's Q1 2016 earnings, while slightly below prior-year results, were largely in line with prior guidance, indicating a lack of major surprises.  Management highlighted continued strong loan growth, driven in part by new card acquisitions.  However, a reduction in the reported discount rate, impacted by the end of the Costco co-brand relationship and by the regulatory changes in the EU, along with elevated investment levels and restructuring charges, slightly tempered the results.  The overall outlook remains cautiously optimistic, with management reaffirming their guidance and expressing plans for further cost reductions, suggesting a potential short-term volatility.
