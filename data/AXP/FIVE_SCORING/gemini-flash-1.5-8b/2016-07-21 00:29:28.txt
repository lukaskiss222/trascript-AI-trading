American Express' Q2 2016 earnings call highlights a complex situation. While the company achieved strong EPS growth driven by the sale of the Costco portfolio, this gain was partially offset by a restructuring charge and elevated investment spending.  Underlying results were largely in line with expectations, but the loss of Costco and other external factors like the Brexit vote and US election dynamics raise uncertainty for the remainder of the year.  The company remains optimistic about long-term growth initiatives but the short-term outlook is marked by adjustments and an expectation of a slightly lower than expected EPS in the second half of 2016.
