American Express' Q3 2015 earnings were in line with expectations, but showed some slowing in billings growth and revenue, partially due to a stronger US dollar and adjustments in co-branding partnerships.  Management signaled continued investment in growth initiatives, which, though impacting short-term profitability, will position the company for long-term. The outlook for Q4 and 2015 EPS remains relatively stable, although nuanced by the challenges discussed, suggesting the stockâ€™s trajectory will be tempered in the near term.
