American Express's Q2 2015 earnings show solid core performance, but are impacted by a strong dollar, co-brand changes, and increased investment in growth initiatives.  While revenue growth was modest and adjusted for these factors, management anticipates a slight EPS decline in the second half and maintains a positive outlook for long-term growth.  The overall tone suggests a short-term neutral to slightly negative impact on the stock price, but with the potential for positive future growth fueled by substantial investments in the second half of the year.
