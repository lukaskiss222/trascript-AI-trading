American Express' Q1 2009 earnings show a significant impact of the economic downturn, with revenue down 18% year-over-year.

While credit quality remains a concern with higher write-off rates, the increasing capital ratios suggest a financially resilient company positioned to weather the storm without major equity dilution.
