American Express delivered strong first-quarter results, exceeding internal targets and signaling continued robustness in key metrics like revenue, which grew by 22%, and EPS. The company emphasized strong international growth and resilient consumer demand, especially among Millennials and Gen Z, despite some macroeconomic uncertainties. This upbeat performance and reaffirmed guidance for 2023, against the backdrop of a broader economic slowdown, will likely positively impact the stock due to confidence in sustained growth momentum, particularly in its high-margin spending categories like Travel and Entertainment.
