The American Express earnings call highlighted several challenges, including economic headwinds and increased competitive pressures, which led the company to adjust its earnings outlook downward. Despite these challenges, the company has maintained strong capital returns and is implementing a cost-reduction program. However, significant concerns remain around the termination of the Costco partnership and regulatory impacts, which could pressure near-term revenues and profits. The managementâ€™s cautious tone and acknowledgment of the tougher conditions suggest that the stock may experience short-term weakness as investors digest the impact of these factors.
