American Express reported a challenging quarter with a notable decline in revenues and modest billing stabilization. The reduction in expenses and charge-off rates provide some optimism, although credit conditions remain tough. Management's cautious tone, coupled with ongoing economic uncertainties and regulatory impacts like the CARD Act, suggest limited near-term growth. The stabilization in spending is positive, but the lack of significant acceleration could pressure the stock in the short term as investors weigh these mixed signals.
