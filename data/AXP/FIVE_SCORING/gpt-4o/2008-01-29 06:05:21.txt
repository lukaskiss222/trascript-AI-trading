American Express reported robust revenue growth in Q4 2007, driven by strong performance across consumer spending and global network services. However, rising delinquencies and write-off rates, primarily in U.S. lending, highlight potential concerns due to a weaker economic environment. Management's cautious approach, including predictions for moderate economic weakening and decreased marketing, suggests they are preparing for potential slower growth. Despite these challenges, the company maintains a strong ROE and returns to shareholders, suggesting resilience but also acknowledging headwinds that could dampen near-term stock performance.
