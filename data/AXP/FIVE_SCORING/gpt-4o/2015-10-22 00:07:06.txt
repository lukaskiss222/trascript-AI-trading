American Express's Q3 2015 earnings call highlighted several challenges that could influence the stock negatively in the short term. The company reported a decline in EPS and slower revenue growth due to pressures from co-brand partnerships, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher growth initiative spending. The impending termination of the relationship with Costco and the competitive environment further add to the short-term uncertainty. Despite efforts to ramp up new card member acquisitions and maintain robust capital returns to shareholders, the immediate outlook is overshadowed by these headwinds, suggesting a likely temporary dip in the stock price.
