American Express reported robust financial performance with 9% revenue growth and a 13% increase in net income, alongside an increase in billed business and cards in force. The company maintained strong credit metrics with historically low write-off rates, although they expect these to rise slightly due to strategic growth initiatives. Despite some global economic uncertainties and slight softening in Europe, American Express continues to perform well compared to competitors. The strong earnings, alongside proactive investments in growth, share repurchases, and effective expense management, suggest a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
