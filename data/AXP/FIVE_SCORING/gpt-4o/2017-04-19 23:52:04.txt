The American Express earnings call indicates a strong start to 2017 with Q1 earnings per share exceeding expectations at $1.34, primarily driven by better-than-expected revenue performance. Despite headwinds from the previous year's Costco portfolio sale, adjusted revenue growth reached 7%, illustrating solid operational execution and cost reduction efforts. Management expressed confidence in achieving full-year EPS guidance, and the acceleration in international business, coupled with successful customer acquisition efforts, suggests potential for continued momentum. The positive tone and reaffirmed guidance support a likely positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
