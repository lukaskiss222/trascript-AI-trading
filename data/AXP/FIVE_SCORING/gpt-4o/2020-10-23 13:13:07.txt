American Express reported Q3 2020 earnings with revenues down 20% year-over-year, reflecting the continued impact of the pandemic. However, management expressed confidence in their strategic investments, such as the largest-ever Shop Small initiative and acquisition of Kabbage, which they believe will drive long-term growth. The company noted strong customer retention and increased online spending, but acknowledged uncertainties remain due to the pandemic's ongoing effects. Their proactive phase two growth strategy and solid credit performance suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock despite broader economic uncertainties.
