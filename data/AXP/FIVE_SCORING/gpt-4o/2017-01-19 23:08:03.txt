American Express's earnings call indicated strong financial results for 2016, outperforming initial expectations, which is a positive sign for investors. The company successfully increased its marketing spend on growth initiatives, focusing on sustainable revenue generation. Despite the loss of the Costco business, American Express demonstrated solid revenue growth excluding this effect and positioned itself for continued improvement in 2017 with expected EPS of $5.60-$5.80. The proactive measures taken to mitigate competition and enhance customer value propositions are likely to support the stock in the short term, leading to a positive investor sentiment.
