American Express reported a strong Q1 2018 performance with 10% FX adjusted revenue growth and a 38% increase in EPS, even as they faced cost of funds challenges and a rising rate environment. The company's diversification strategy is evident in its growth across premium consumer segments and SME, as well as its international footprint, particularly notable in markets like Australia and the UK. With an optimistic EPS guidance at the higher end, and expectations to resume share buybacks later in the year, the stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
