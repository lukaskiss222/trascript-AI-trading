American Express reported an increase in revenues and net income but noted a slowdown in spend growth over recent quarters, partially due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Despite enjoying record-low credit losses and maintaining strong capital ratios, concern about the broad-based deceleration in global billed business was evident. Management mitigated immediate alarm by emphasizing controlled operating expenses and ongoing investments in strategic areas such as digital and loyalty programs. The cautious optimism of management and efforts to maintain growth suggest a steady stock performance, but the slowing growth rates could weigh on short-term investor sentiment.
