American Express reported strong fourth quarter results with 7% revenue growth, a 15% increase in net income, and an EPS of $1.01. Despite tough year-over-year comparisons and global economic challenges, the company's spend-centric model continued to outperform, especially in the context of a high-quality customer base and control over operating expenses. However, with expected headwinds like reduced reserve releases and no Visa/MasterCard settlement benefits, short-term stock impact may be modest. The management's cautious tone on macro conditions and strategic focusing signal stability rather than immediate gains.
