The American Express Q2 2017 earnings call reveals a favorable situation for the company's short-term performance. The company's strategic adjustments have led to steady 8% adjusted revenue growth, and although net income was down due to the previous year's one-time gain, EPS performance remained robust. Positive signs include improved growth in international markets and effective cost management efforts, with explicit guidance from CFO Jeff Campbell expecting full-year revenue to surpass the previous 5-6% growth expectations. Despite economic challenges, management's confident outlook and strong momentum suggest a positive short-term rally in the stock.
