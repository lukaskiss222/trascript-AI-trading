American Express reported solid results for the fourth quarter of 2013, with revenue and earnings per share growth driven by increased spending volumes and disciplined expense control. The company continues to demonstrate strong capital management and returned a significant portion of capital to shareholders through buybacks. Despite a challenging economic backdrop, American Express achieved higher-than-expected earnings growth and maintained robust credit metrics. The management's optimistic tone and ongoing investment in growth initiatives suggest a favorable market reaction in the short term.
