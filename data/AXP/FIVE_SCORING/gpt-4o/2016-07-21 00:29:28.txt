American Express's Q2 2016 earnings call highlighted several notable points: the financials were heavily impacted by the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio resulting in a one-time $1.1 billion pre-tax gain, yet the underlying performance was consistent with expectations. Despite restructuring charges, AXP maintained controlled operating expenses and aggressive share buybacks. However, the end of the Costco relationship poses a challenge, leading to a cautious outlook for H2 2016 and introducing complexity into short-term forecasts. The companyâ€™s strategic initiatives, such as growth in non-US segments and new card acquisitions, along with a robust capital return plan, indicate a well-managed response to current challenges. The mixed nature of these factors suggests a largely neutral impact on the stock in the short term.
