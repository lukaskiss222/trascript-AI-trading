American Express reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 results with double-digit EPS growth, aided by higher consumer spending and strict cost controls. However, short-term challenges are apparent due to increased competition in co-branded partnerships, highlighted by the costs associated with renewing the Delta partnership, and foreign exchange headwinds from a strong U.S. dollar. While the long-term outlook remains solid due to strategic partnerships and cost management, these immediate pressures may exert downward influence on the stock in the short term.
