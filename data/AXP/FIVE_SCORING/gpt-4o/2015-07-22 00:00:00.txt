American Express's Q2 2015 earnings call indicates some short-term challenges, such as slower US billing growth and impacts from a strong US dollar. While the company maintains a solid core earnings performance, it anticipates flat to modestly down EPS for the full year, signaling potential pressure on the stock price. Additionally, pending regulatory changes and strategic spending shifts, combined with potential headwinds from changes in co-brand partnerships and international FX impacts, could create short-term volatility for the stock.
