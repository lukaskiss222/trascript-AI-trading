American Express reported solid financial performance, with revenues and income from continuing operations growing by 12% and 27%, respectively, surpassing market expectations. The company achieved its long-term revenue growth target, demonstrating strong global billed business growth, and maintained excellent credit performance. However, concerns around rising costs in the Membership Rewards program, particularly due to higher redemption rates, may raise caution. Nevertheless, the company's broad-based revenue growth, exceptional credit metrics, and strategic investments suggest a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
