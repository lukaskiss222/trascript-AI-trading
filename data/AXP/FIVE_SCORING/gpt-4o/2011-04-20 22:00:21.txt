American Express reported strong first-quarter performance in 2011, with revenue and income growth exceeding industry averages. The company's focus on premium lending and credit improvements resulted in favorable financial metrics. Despite caution over increased expenses and the likely wind-down of Visa/MasterCard payments, American Express's strategic initiatives in digital payments and fee-based revenue streams set a positive medium- to long-term outlook. However, in the near term, the stock might experience a neutral impact given the balance between strong results and uncertainty in regulatory and economic environments, alongside the planned slowdown in expense growth.
