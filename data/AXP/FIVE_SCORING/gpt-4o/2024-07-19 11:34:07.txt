American Express reported strong Q2 results with record revenues and a significant year-over-year earnings increase. The company also raised its full-year EPS guidance, citing continued momentum in its core business and strategic investments in marketing, expected to enhance growth without using proceeds from the Accertify sale. However, the slower growth in US consumer spending and SME segments aligns with their anticipations of a stable, albeit not high, growth rate. The overall positive tone of the management, robust credit performance, and raised guidance suggest that these results are likely to be perceived favorably by the market, supporting a positive impact on the stock in the short term.
