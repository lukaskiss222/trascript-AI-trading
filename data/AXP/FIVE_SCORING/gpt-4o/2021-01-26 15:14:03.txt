The American Express Q4 2020 earnings call showed that the company fared well amidst the ongoing pandemic, demonstrating strong credit performance, increased online spending, and resilience in non-Travel & Entertainment (T&E) spending. While T&E spending remains suppressed, there is optimism surrounding a rebound in consumer travel as vaccine distribution improves. The management's strategy includes aggressive investments to rebuild growth momentum, which may yield positive outcomes but remains influenced by broader economic conditions. Given the steady recovery trends and investment outlook, thereâ€™s a positive short-term sentiment likely supporting the stock.
