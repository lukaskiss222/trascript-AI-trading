American Express reported strong Q1 2024 results with notable increases in revenue and EPS, driven by robust consumer spending, especially in international markets. Despite a softer SME segment and moderated growth in late payments and delinquency rates, the company maintained high credit quality and reaffirmed full-year guidance, underscoring confidence in its strategic initiatives. The positive tone and sustained momentum in customer acquisition and engagement, particularly among Millennials and Gen Z, suggest a short-term positive impact on the stock price.
