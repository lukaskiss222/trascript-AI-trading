American Express reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results, with revenue growth exceeding expectations and EPS increasing significantly. The company continues to demonstrate its ability to drive growth through strategic investments in premium consumer products, commercial payments, and global expansion. Despite some deceleration in billed business due to lapping high growth rates from the prior year, management remains confident in achieving 2019 revenue growth of 8-10%, aided by continued expansion in card member benefits and merchant coverage. The positive guidance, alongside consistent performance across various business segments, suggests a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
