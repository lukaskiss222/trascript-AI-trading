American Express reported strong Q2 2023 results, with record high revenues and EPS, supported by notable gains in card member spending, especially among Millennial and Gen Z customers, growing international segments, and robust travel and entertainment spending. The reaffirmation of guidance for 2023 and continued confidence in long-term growth aspirations of double-digit revenue and mid-teens EPS growth indicate a positive outlook. The renewal of key partnerships, like with Hilton, the resilience of the premium customer base, and effective risk management underline stability. Overall, the strong quarterly performance and positive forward guidance are likely to favorably impact the stock price in the short term.
