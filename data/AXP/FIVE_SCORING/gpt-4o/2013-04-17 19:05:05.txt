American Express reported a 4% increase in total revenues with robust growth in net interest income and stable credit performance, reflected by a lower reserve release compared to the previous year. Despite these positives, pre-tax income growth outpaced net income due to no tax benefits in the current quarter, a factor which could weigh on investor sentiment. The company's EPS grew by 7%, surpassing revenue growth, driven by effective expense control and share buybacks. The management's emphasis on maintaining a strong capital position and shareholder returns, including a planned dividend increase, presents a balanced outlook but might not provide a strong positive catalyst for the stock in the short term.
