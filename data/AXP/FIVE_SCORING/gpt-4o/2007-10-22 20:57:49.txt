American Express reported strong third-quarter 2007 earnings, with a continuation of impressive revenue growth, particularly in card member spending and international markets. The company's EPS rose by 18%, and revenue increased by 11%, reflecting a solid performance despite industry credit challenges. Management expressed confidence in ongoing growth opportunities, leveraging investments in marketing and focusing on high-spend customers, which aligns with their strategic initiatives. However, the headwinds from rising interest expenses and slight upticks in credit provisions may temper immediate investor enthusiasm, yet the positive results and optimistic outlook suggest a likely short-term positive impact on the stock.
