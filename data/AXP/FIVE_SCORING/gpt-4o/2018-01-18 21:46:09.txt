American Express reported a solid Q4 2017 performance, with revenue growth hitting multiyear highs and strong momentum across various segments, particularly U.S. consumer and international markets. The company adjusted to a significant $2.6 billion tax charge yet presented clear guidance for continued growth, targeting 7%â€“8% revenue growth and a notable EPS increase for 2018. The implementation of successful strategies, focus on a strong premium consumer segment, and effective cost management are positive indicators, despite some market pressures. Overall, management communicated confidence in sustained growth, which should positively impact the stock in the short term.
