American Express reported strong Q3 2019 results, with consistent revenue growth, driven by FX-adjusted increases and significant card fee revenue, contributing to a double-digit EPS growth of 11%. Management expressed confidence in meeting their full-year EPS guidance and continued high revenue growth, despite a modest global economic growth environment. The strategic focus on card refreshes, international expansion, and leveraging a strong customer base indicates sustained momentum, likely creating a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
