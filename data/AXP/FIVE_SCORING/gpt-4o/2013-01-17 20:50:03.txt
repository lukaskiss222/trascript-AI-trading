American Express reported solid performance in Q4 2012 with revenue and net income showing growth compared to the previous year. Despite challenges such as restructuring charges and adjustments, the company demonstrated strong capital ratios and effective expense management, aiming to maintain operating expense growth below 3% in the subsequent years. Their commitment to returning capital through buybacks and dividends suggests strong shareholder value focus, but the slightly reduced billed business growth and challenging economic conditions may counterbalance immediate stock positivity.
