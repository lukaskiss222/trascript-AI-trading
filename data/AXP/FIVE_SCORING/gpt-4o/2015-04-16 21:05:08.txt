American Express reported a solid first quarter with an 11% EPS growth, exceeding their expectations partially due to timing benefits that won't repeat in subsequent quarters. However, management maintained a full-year EPS outlook that is flat to modestly down, citing impacts from the strengthening U.S. dollar and changes to cobrand relationships, including the loss of Costco as a partner. While the core operations showed resilience, the anticipated negative effect on upcoming quarters' earnings, particularly without the Costco partnership in the U.S. and currency headwinds, suggests probable short-term pressure on the stock.
