American Express displayed strong relative performance, but its results were undermined by challenging US credit conditions that impacted earnings. The company's revenue grew by 11%, but income decreased by 11%, suggesting pressure from increased marketing spend and higher provisions for credit losses due to economic uncertainties. Management's cautious stance on credit and spending growth, along with anticipated higher loan loss rates, point to potential short-term hurdles. The market's negative reaction may be tempered by the company's historical resilience and strategic adjustments, yet uncertainty over credit conditions is likely to exert some downward pressure on the stock short-term.
