American Express's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed several challenges, including an 18% decrease in total revenues and significant declines in spending and lending activities, reflecting economic pressures. However, the company showed resilience by maintaining a 10% write-off rate, better than expected, and demonstrating strong liquidity with $22 billion in excess cash and securities. While spending trends showed slight improvement, the cautious tone regarding regulatory impacts and macroeconomic uncertainties suggests limited positive sentiment in the short-term. Overall, the mixed financial results combined with continued economic challenges point to a neutral impact on the stock in the near term.
