American Express reported strong Q1 2021 results that exceeded expectations, signaling a positive trajectory for the company. The company is benefiting from a recovery in spending, especially in the U.S., as vaccine rollout progresses, and there is evidence of pent-up demand for travel, which management anticipates will continue to improve. Additionally, new card acquisitions are surpassing pre-pandemic levels, with premium products performing exceptionally well. Management's optimistic tone and confidence in returning to pre-pandemic earnings expectations by 2022 suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
