The American Express earnings call transcript indicates a mixed short-term outlook. The company's Q1 results met internal expectations, but they face challenges ahead, notably the end of the Costco partnership, which could impact future revenues and customer retention efforts. Management is making efforts to capture new business with increased investment and cost control measures, highlighted by the positive loan growth and strong balance sheet. However, caution is warranted given the uncertainties surrounding impacts from the Costco transition. Overall, the short-term stock reaction could be neutral or slightly negative due to these transitional challenges and uncertainties.
