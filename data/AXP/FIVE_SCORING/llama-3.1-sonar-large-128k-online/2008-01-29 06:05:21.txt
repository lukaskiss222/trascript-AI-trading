The American Express 2007 Q4 earnings call reveals several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and EPS Growth**: Despite a strong year with 10% revenue growth and 16% increase in diluted EPS, the fourth quarter saw a decline in earnings due to various significant items, including higher interest expenses and credit-related charges. The guidance for 2008 anticipates a more modest EPS growth of 4% to 6% due to comparisons against a strong 2007[5].

2. **Credit Performance**: The company experienced an increase in delinquencies and write-off rates, particularly in the U.S. lending portfolio, which is attributed to the weakening economic environment. However, international credit metrics improved, and the charge card portfolio is holding up relatively better[5].

3. **Marketing and Expenses**: American Express plans to reduce marketing and promotion expenses slightly in 2008, although rewards costs are expected to continue in line with business growth. The company has demonstrated the ability to manage expenses effectively during economic downturns[5].

4. **Economic Outlook**: The guidance assumes a moderately weaker U.S. economy, with billed business growth expected to slow down. However, the company remains confident in its ability to manage through the economic cycle and maintain a strong competitive position[5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, increased credit losses, and the overall cautious economic outlook. However, the company's strong historical performance, effective expense management, and robust international credit metrics suggest resilience.
