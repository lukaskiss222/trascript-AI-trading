The American Express third-quarter 2007 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Business Momentum**: American Express reported strong revenue and earnings growth, with an 11% increase in net revenue, a 15% increase in income, and an 18% rise in diluted EPS. This indicates robust business performance and continued investment in growth initiatives[4].

2. **Credit Quality and Provisioning**: Despite some increase in delinquencies and write-offs, American Express's credit quality remains favorable, particularly in the prime and super-prime segments. The company's provisioning policy is consistent, and credit indicators are in line with historic ranges[4].

3. **Interest Expense and Funding Costs**: Higher interest expenses due to the expiration of fixed-rate debt and hedges, as well as higher market rates, were noted. However, the company expects funding costs to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter if market conditions persist[4].

4. **Investment and Marketing**: American Express has increased marketing investments, especially internationally, which is expected to drive future growth. The company is focused on acquiring high-spending card members and maintaining a strong loyalty program[4].

5. **Tax Benefits and Capital Allocation**: The company benefited from a $75 million tax benefit, and the overall tax rate was lower. Capital allocation remains focused on share repurchases and dividends, with a policy of returning over 55% of capital generated to shareholders[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, reflecting strong business performance, effective management of credit risks, and a strategic approach to growth and capital allocation. However, the mention of higher interest expenses and the general economic concerns might introduce some caution.

### Predicted Impact on Stock Price

- **Positive Impact**: The strong business momentum, favorable credit quality, and strategic investments are likely to support the stock price.
- **Neutral on Short-Term Economic Concerns**: The increase in interest expenses and general economic uncertainties might temper some of the optimism but are not expected to significantly dampen the positive outlook.
