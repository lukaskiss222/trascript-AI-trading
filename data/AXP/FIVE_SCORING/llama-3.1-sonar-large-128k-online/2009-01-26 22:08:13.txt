The earnings transcript for American Express Company highlights several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Economic Environment and Performance
- The company operated in a very challenging economic environment in 2008, marked by a significant decline in consumer spending, rising delinquencies, and increased loan write-offs. This environment is expected to continue into 2009, which could negatively impact the stock[3].

## Financial Performance
- Total revenues net of interest expense declined by 11% (or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis), and diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.21, significantly lower than previous periods. The company also reported higher provisioning for credit losses and a restructuring charge, which further impacted earnings[3].

## Liquidity and Funding
- Despite the challenging environment, American Express enhanced its liquidity position significantly, raising $9 billion in retail CDs and $6 billion under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. This strong liquidity position is a positive factor but may not immediately offset the negative impact of reduced earnings and economic uncertainty[3].

## Guidance and Outlook
- The company expects difficult economic conditions to persist in 2009, with continued pressure on card member spending and higher write-off rates. This cautious outlook could weigh on investor sentiment[3].

## Operational Adjustments
- American Express has implemented various cost-saving measures, including a significant restructuring charge, and is focused on maintaining profitability and liquidity. While these actions are positive for long-term sustainability, they may not provide immediate relief to the stock price given the current economic backdrop[3].

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for American Express's stock is likely to be negatively impacted by the poor economic environment, reduced earnings, and cautious guidance for 2009.
