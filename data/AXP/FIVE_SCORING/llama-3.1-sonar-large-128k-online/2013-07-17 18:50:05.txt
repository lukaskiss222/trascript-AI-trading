The American Express Q2 2013 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Financial Performance**: American Express reported strong financial results, including a 4% increase in total revenues, a 5% increase in net income, and a 10% increase in EPS. These metrics indicate healthy performance despite a slow economic environment.

2. **European Regulatory Impact**: The discussion around the EC draft proposal on interchange fees and payment network regulations suggested that American Express's proprietary business would not be directly impacted, as the caps primarily apply to four-party payment systems like Visa and MasterCard. However, there is some uncertainty and potential indirect impact, which could introduce volatility.

3. **Expense Management and Capital Return**: The company demonstrated strong expense control, with a 4% decrease in total operating expenses year-over-year, and a commitment to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

4. **Growth Drivers**: The growth in billed business, particularly in regions like China, Korea, and Japan, and the focus on premium card products, suggest continued momentum in key segments.

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and positive trends in key metrics such as billed business growth and expense management are likely to support the stock.
- The uncertainty around European regulatory changes might introduce some short-term volatility but does not seem to significantly threaten the company's core business model.

Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the solid earnings report and the company's ability to navigate regulatory challenges.
