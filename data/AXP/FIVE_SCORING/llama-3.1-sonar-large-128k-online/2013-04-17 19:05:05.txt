The American Express Company's Q1 2013 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: American Express reported a 5% FX-adjusted revenue growth, which is consistent with the previous quarter but slightly below historical averages. Net income grew 2%, and EPS increased by 7%, partly due to share buybacks. This mixed performance might not significantly boost the stock in the short term[1].

2. **Expense Control and Capital Return**: The company demonstrated strong expense control, with operating expenses increasing only 1% year-over-year, and a commitment to keeping expense growth below 3% for the next two years. Additionally, American Express plans to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which is generally positive for investor sentiment[1].

3. **Credit Performance**: Credit metrics remained stable and at historically low levels, which is a positive indicator of the company's lending portfolio health. However, the provision for losses increased due to higher receivables and reserve adjustments, which might slightly dampen short-term enthusiasm[1].

4. **Macro and Competitive Environment**: The company noted a sluggish economic environment and some competitive pressures, particularly in the travel segment and from other card issuers. However, American Express's affluent customer base and innovative products are expected to maintain performance[1].

Given these points:

- The company's ability to control expenses and return capital to shareholders is positive.
- The stable credit performance and consistent revenue growth, despite economic headwinds, are also positive.
- However, the mixed earnings growth and slight increases in provisions for losses might temper immediate market enthusiasm.

**Conclusion**: The overall impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive in the short term, reflecting the company's solid fundamentals and capital return strategies, but also considering the modest revenue growth and economic challenges.

**Rating**: 1
