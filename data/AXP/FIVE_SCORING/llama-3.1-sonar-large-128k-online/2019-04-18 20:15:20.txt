The American Express Q1 2019 earnings call presented several key points that suggest a positive outlook for the company, despite some minor challenges.

### Key Points:
- **Revenue and Earnings**: American Express reported a 9% FX-adjusted revenue growth, with adjusted EPS of $2.01, slightly above expectations. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of FX-adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better[4].
- **Loan Growth**: Total loan growth was 12%, driven largely by existing customers, and credit quality remained strong[4].
- **Delta Partnership**: The 11-year extension of the strategic partnership with Delta Airlines is expected to drive significant growth in billings, lending, revenue, and profitability. Although there is a $200 million headwind in marketing and business development costs this year, the long-term benefits are anticipated to be substantial[4].
- **Merchant Network Expansion**: American Express continues to expand its merchant network, nearing virtual parity in the U.S. and making progress internationally[4].
- **Guidance**: The company reaffirmed its guidance for 2019, expecting revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted EPS between $7.85 and $8.35[4].

### Short-Term Implications:
- The solid start to the year, coupled with the extension of the Delta partnership and continued expansion of the merchant network, suggests sustained growth.
- The minor headwind from the Delta agreement and some seasonal impacts are not expected to significantly dampen the overall positive trend.
- The companyâ€™s ability to maintain strong customer engagement, especially through digital channels and strategic partnerships, is a positive sign.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
