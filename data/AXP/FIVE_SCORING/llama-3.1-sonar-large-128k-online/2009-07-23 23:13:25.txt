The American Express Q2 2009 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Elements
- The company reported earnings from continuing operations of $342 million, which, although lower than the previous year, indicates profitability in a challenging economic environment.
- There was a slight moderation in the year-over-year spending decline in June and July, suggesting some stabilization in consumer spending.
- Credit metrics showed improvement, with lower than expected bankruptcy levels and an anticipated decrease in write-off rates for the third and fourth quarters.
- The company has a strong liquidity position, with $22 billion in excess cash and marketable securities, and has successfully accessed various funding sources.
- American Express plans to increase investments in marketing, promotions, and other business initiatives, which could support future growth.

### Negative Elements
- Total revenues decreased by 18% (10% on an FX-adjusted basis), reflecting the ongoing economic downturn.
- The lending provision remained high due to increased write-off rates and economic uncertainty, impacting earnings.
- Despite the moderation in spending declines, overall spending levels are still down significantly, and the outlook for the economy remains uncertain.
- The company faces regulatory headwinds, particularly from potential interchange regulation and the Credit Card Act, which could impact revenue and profitability.

### Conclusion
Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience some short-term volatility but may not face significant downward pressure due to the company's ability to remain profitable, its strong liquidity position, and the slight improvement in credit metrics. However, the overall economic uncertainty and regulatory risks might limit any significant upside.
