The American Express 2008 second-quarter earnings call highlights several key points that suggest a challenging short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Economic Deterioration**: The U.S. economy is weakening, with significant increases in unemployment, home price declines, and low consumer confidence. This has led to a sharp slowdown in card member spending, particularly among consumers, and increased credit losses.

2. **Credit Performance**: The company experienced higher write-offs and deteriorating roll rates, especially in June, indicating a worsening credit environment. This has prompted American Express to increase its lending reserves and adjust its interest-only strip, reflecting higher anticipated write-offs.

3. **Revenue and EPS Guidance**: Despite solid revenue growth, the company is no longer tracking to its 4-6% EPS growth forecast due to the economic downturn. The outlook for lending write-off rates in the third and fourth quarters is expected to be higher than June levels.

4. **Cost Management and Strategic Focus**: American Express is scaling back card acquisition efforts, reducing credit lines selectively, and reallocating investments to international and business-to-business markets. However, these measures may not immediately offset the current economic headwinds.

Given these points, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, increased credit losses, and the broader economic uncertainty.
