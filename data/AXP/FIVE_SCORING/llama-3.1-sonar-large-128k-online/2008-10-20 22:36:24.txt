The American Express 2008 third quarter earnings call highlights several key points that suggest a challenging short-term outlook for the company's stock:

## Economic Environment and Consumer Spending
The executives emphasized the difficult economic environment, predicting further deterioration in consumer and business sentiment, and a subsequent impact on cardmember spending and loan growth. This suggests a weakening in the company's core revenue streams[3].

## Credit Metrics and Losses
The company reported an increase in credit losses, with a net write-off rate of 5.9% in the third quarter, expected to rise further in the next two quarters. This, combined with higher 30-day past due rates, indicates increasing credit risk and potential pressure on the company's bottom line[3].

## Funding and Liquidity
While American Express has a comprehensive liquidity plan and access to various funding sources, the current market conditions, including high LIBOR rates and frozen long-term funding markets, pose significant challenges. These factors could increase funding costs and compress margins[3].

## Restructuring and Cost-Cutting
The planned restructuring and cost-cutting measures, though aimed at long-term benefits, will result in immediate restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. This could negatively impact short-term earnings[3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered economic outlook, increased credit losses, and higher funding costs.
