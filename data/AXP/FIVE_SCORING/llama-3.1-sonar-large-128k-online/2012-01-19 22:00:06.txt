The American Express Q4 2011 earnings call presented several key points that suggest a positive but cautious outlook for the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: American Express reported strong revenue growth of 7%, with total revenues net of interest expense at $7.7 billion, and a net income of $1.2 billion, representing a 15% increase in EPS.
- **Expense Management**: The company successfully contained operating expense growth, which is a positive sign for future profitability. Total expenses increased only 1% or decreased 2% when adjusted for the MasterCard settlement payment.
- **Credit Metrics**: Credit metrics remained at historic lows, with lending write-off rates improving and reserves as a percentage of loans and past dues decreasing.
- **Regional Performance**: While billed business growth slowed in Europe, other regions maintained reasonable growth, and overall billed business held up well.
- **Investment and Growth Strategies**: American Express is investing in new businesses such as Prepaid, Serve, and Loyalty Partner, which are expected to drive long-term growth.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, effective expense management, and ongoing investments in growth initiatives.
