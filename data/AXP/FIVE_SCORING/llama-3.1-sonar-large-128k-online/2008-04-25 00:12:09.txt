The American Express Q1 2008 earnings call indicates several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

## Revenue and Growth
American Express reported strong revenue growth of 11%, despite a challenging economic environment. However, this growth was offset by higher marketing spending and the impact of the US credit environment, resulting in an 11% decrease in income and a 7% decrease in diluted EPS.

## Credit Quality
The company faced higher write-off rates and delinquency rates, particularly in geographies with significant housing market declines. This led to a 48% increase in the total provision for losses, which could continue to pressure the stock.

## Funding and Liquidity
American Express maintained strong liquidity and funding capabilities, but at higher costs due to increased credit spreads and LIBOR rates. This could impact their cost of funding and profitability.

## Guidance and Outlook
The company reaffirmed its 2008 EPS growth guidance of 4% to 6%, despite expecting higher credit losses in the second quarter. The management emphasized their ability to manage credit effectively and balance risk against profitability and growth.

Given these factors:

- The strong revenue growth is a positive indicator, but it is tempered by the higher credit losses and increased funding costs.
- The company's ability to manage through a difficult economic environment and maintain its business momentum is positive, but the immediate outlook on credit quality and funding costs introduces some uncertainty.

Overall, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the increased credit losses and higher funding costs, but the company's long-term strategy and diversified business portfolio suggest stability.
