The Q1 2023 earnings call for American Express highlighted several positive and some mixed signals that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Signals
- **Record Revenues**: American Express reported a record $14.3 billion in revenues, up 22% year-over-year, driven by strong Card Member spending, particularly in Travel and Entertainment (T&E) which grew 39% on an FX-adjusted basis[1][3][5>.
- **Strong Customer Acquisition**: The company acquired 3.4 million new cards, with a significant portion coming from Millennial and Gen Z consumers, who are driving high growth in billed business and premium fee-based products[1][3][5>.
- **International Growth**: International Card Services showed robust growth, especially in T&E spending, benefiting from organizational changes and improved merchant coverage[1][3][5>.
- **Credit Performance**: Despite some increase in delinquency rates, credit metrics remain strong, with write-off and delinquency rates below pre-pandemic levels[1][3][5].

### Mixed Signals
- **Softness in U.S. Small Business Spending**: There was a slight slowdown in U.S. small business spending, particularly in Goods and Services, although this was partially offset by strong international growth and other segments[1][3][5>.
- **Provision for Credit Losses**: The company saw an increase in provisions for credit losses, reflecting a reserve build and higher net write-offs, although this is expected to moderate[1][3][5>.
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Management noted mixed economic signals and the potential impact of credit tightening, although they expressed confidence in their customers' resilience and the company's ability to manage through economic uncertainties[1][3][5].

### Conclusion
Given the strong revenue growth, robust customer acquisition, and continued confidence in achieving full-year guidance, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive. However, the slight softness in U.S. small business spending and the mixed economic outlook might introduce some caution. Nonetheless, the strong performance and guidance reaffirmation are likely to support the stock price.
