The transcript of American Express's third-quarter earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Stabilization in Billed Business**: American Express has seen stabilization in billed business over the last few months, with year-over-year declines improving. This stabilization, although not yet translating into growth, is a positive sign[4].

2. **Credit Metrics Improvement**: Credit trends have shown overall improvement, with charge card losses moderating and lending write-offs declining. However, reserves were still increased due to economic uncertainty[4].

3. **Expense Management and Liquidity**: The company has managed expenses effectively through reengineering programs and maintained strong liquidity positions, which is a positive indicator of financial health[4].

4. **Competitive Positioning**: American Express remains confident in its competitive position, particularly in the premium segment, despite increased competition from other banks. The company continues to invest in its value propositions and customer service[4].

5. **Economic Uncertainty**: The economy remains uncertain, with high unemployment and cautious consumer spending. However, the company sees opportunities for growth as economic conditions improve[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a neutral to slightly positive response in the short term. The stabilization in billed business, improvement in credit metrics, and strong liquidity position are positive indicators. However, the ongoing economic uncertainty and the impact of the Card Act on revenues may temper immediate optimism.
