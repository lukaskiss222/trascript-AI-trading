The American Express Q3 2015 earnings call highlighted several challenges and strategic initiatives that are likely to impact the stock in the short term:

- **Challenges**: The company faced headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar, increased costs associated with renewing co-brand partnerships, and lower average transaction sizes, particularly in gas and airline spending. These factors led to a 14% decline in net income and an 11% decline in EPS compared to the prior year[2][4].
- **Guidance**: The full-year 2015 EPS guidance was narrowed to $5.20-$5.35, which implies a modest decline from the previous year. However, the company remains confident in returning to positive EPS growth in 2016[2][4].
- **Growth Initiatives**: Despite the challenges, American Express is investing heavily in growth initiatives, including marketing, technology, and expanding card acceptance. These efforts have led to a significant increase in new card acquisitions, which is a positive sign for long-term growth[2][4].
- **Cost Management**: The company is managing costs effectively, with a focus on operating leverage and efficiency. However, some one-time charges, such as the $91 million impairment charge, were reported due to changes in product strategies and resource allocation[2][4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be negative due to the current challenges and the modest decline in earnings. However, the long-term outlook remains positive due to the company's strategic initiatives and cost management.
