The Q1 2009 earnings call for American Express reveals several key points that suggest a mixed but generally challenging outlook for the short term:

## Key Points
- **Revenue and Earnings**: Revenues were down 18% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a managed, FX-adjusted basis. Earnings from continuing operations were $443 million, a significant decline but still positive[5}.
- **Credit Metrics**: Write-off rates and delinquencies are up, largely driven by the economic environment and higher unemployment. However, the company has taken proactive credit and collection actions, which may be showing some positive signs, though it is too early to declare a trend[5].
- **Expense Management**: American Express has demonstrated strong expense control, with a reduction in operating expenses by 14% and additional reengineering efforts planned for the second quarter. This flexibility in the business model is a positive factor[5].
- **Capital and Liquidity**: The company has a strong capital position, with a tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.1%, and $25 billion in excess cash and marketable securities. This positions them well to manage through the economic downturn[5].
- **Outlook**: The company anticipates higher write-off rates in the second quarter but expects them to stabilize in the third and fourth quarters, assuming unemployment levels stabilize around 9.7% by December. Spending levels continue to be under pressure, but the decline has been consistent rather than accelerating[5].

## Short-Term Impact on Stock Price
Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the continued economic challenges, higher write-off rates, and reduced spending. However, the company's strong expense control, solid capital position, and diversified business model suggest some resilience.

**Conclusion**:
The short-term outlook for American Express's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative due to ongoing economic challenges and higher credit losses, despite the company's efforts to manage expenses and maintain liquidity.

**Rating**:
