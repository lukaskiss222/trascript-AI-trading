The American Express Q1 2015 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Elements:
- The company reported an 11% increase in EPS, better than the full-year outlook, driven by solid core performance, disciplined expense control, and lower provision costs.
- Strong momentum in key initiatives such as the expansion of small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the launch of the Plenti loyalty coalition program, and new cobrand partnerships.
- A strong 2015 CCAR performance, which allows for increased dividend and share repurchases.
- Continued loan growth, particularly in the U.S., and a robust balance sheet.

### Negative Elements:
- The impact of the U.S. dollar's strength resulted in a significant headwind, reducing reported revenue growth by nearly four percentage points.
- The termination of the relationship with Costco in Canada and the upcoming termination in the U.S. are expected to impact performance, particularly in the latter part of 2015.
- A slowdown in corporate card spending, primarily in the U.S., which could be a cautionary signal for broader economic trends.
- Higher cost of card member services and a expected increase in provision expenses for the remainder of 2015.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The positive EPS growth and strong underlying performance are offset by the discrete impacts from FX, cobrand changes, and the anticipated slower growth in certain segments.

### Rating:
