The earnings call for American Express highlights several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Challenging Environment**: The company faces various headwinds, including a stronger U.S. dollar, lower gas prices, and competitive and regulatory pressures. These factors have led to a more cautious outlook for 2016 and 2017[4].

2. **Cost Reduction Initiatives**: American Express has announced a $1 billion cost reduction plan by the end of 2017, aiming to reduce operating expenses by at least 3% from the 2015 base. This initiative, while positive for long-term efficiency, may involve restructuring charges in 2016[4].

3. **Revenue Growth**: Despite challenges, the company achieved adjusted revenue growth of 4% in 2015, but this growth did not accelerate as expected. The outlook for 2016 includes expectations of modest growth, partly fueled by the gain from the pending Costco portfolio sale[4].

4. **Guidance and EPS**: The EPS guidance for 2016 is between $5.40 and $5.70, which includes the benefit from the Costco portfolio sale but excludes restructuring charges. This range is lower than previous expectations, indicating a cautious stance[4].

5. **Competitive Dynamics**: The company is facing increased competition and regulatory pressures, particularly in the area of merchant fees and co-brand economics. However, American Express remains confident in its integrated payments model and its ability to maintain premium valuation through strong customer relationships and data-driven innovations[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on American Express's stock is likely to be negative due to the cautious outlook, reduced revenue growth expectations, and the presence of significant headwinds such as FX and regulatory challenges.
