The American Express Q3 2012 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook. Here are the key points:

### Positive Factors
- Revenue growth of 4% (5% on an FX-adjusted basis), although slightly slower than the previous quarter, is still robust compared to industry peers.
- Net interest income grew 6%, driven by a 4% increase in average Cardmember Loans and a slightly higher net interest yield.
- Loan growth of 6% is better than the industry average, attributed to stabilized paydown rates and a focus on premium lending.
- Credit metrics are at historical lows, with write-off rates declining and reserves as a percentage of loans decreasing.
- Strong capital position with a Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%, well above required benchmarks.
- Effective expense management, with total expenses 2% lower than the prior year.

### Neutral to Negative Factors
- Billed business growth rate slowed slightly compared to the previous quarter, consistent with broader industry trends.
- Travel commissions and fees decreased 3% due to a 6% decline in worldwide travel sales.
- The review of the ultimate redemption rate (URR) for Membership Rewards may lead to a potential charge in the fourth quarter, although the exact impact is not yet quantifiable.
- Regulatory and litigation reserves, though manageable, continue to be a factor.

### Short-Term Impact
Given these factors, the short-term impact on American Express's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's robust revenue growth, strong credit metrics, and effective expense management are positives. However, the slight slowdown in billed business growth and potential charges related to the URR review could temper enthusiasm.

### Conclusion
The overall financial performance and management's confidence in their business model, despite some minor headwinds, suggest that the stock will not experience significant negative pressure in the short term.
