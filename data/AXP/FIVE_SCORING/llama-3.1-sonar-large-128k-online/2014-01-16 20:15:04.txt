American Express's Q4 2013 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported solid revenue growth, driven by a 9% FX-adjusted billed business growth and a 6% FX-adjusted revenue growth. Net income was up sharply, and EPS increased by 25% year-over-year, adjusted for certain items.

2. **Operating Expense Control**: American Express maintained disciplined control over operating expenses, meeting their goal of growing these expenses by less than 3% annually. This discipline is expected to continue into 2014.

3. **Capital Position and Share Repurchases**: The company has a strong capital position, which allowed for significant share repurchases in 2013. This trend is expected to continue, with a commitment to return about 50% of capital to shareholders.

4. **Joint Venture and Potential Gain**: The upcoming joint venture in the business travel division is anticipated to bring a material gain, although the exact amount is not quantified. This could provide additional financial flexibility in 2014.

5. **Economic Outlook and Growth Opportunities**: The company is cautiously optimistic about economic growth in 2014, planning to balance investments in growth opportunities with maintaining strong financial targets. Online spending growth and international expansion, particularly in China, are highlighted as positive trends.

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, reflecting strong financial performance, disciplined expense management, and promising growth opportunities. However, the stock's recent price increase and the company's commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases might temper immediate gains.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the solid financial performance and the company's strategic initiatives, but any immediate rally might be muted due to the stock's recent price appreciation.
