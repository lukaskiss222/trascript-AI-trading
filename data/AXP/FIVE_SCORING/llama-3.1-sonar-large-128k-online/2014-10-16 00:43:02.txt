American Express's third-quarter 2014 earnings call presented several key points that suggest a stable but cautious outlook for the short term:

### Positive Factors
- The company reported a 12% increase in EPS, driven by higher spending by card members, solid loan growth, and disciplined control of operating expenses.
- Billed business growth was 10% on an FX-adjusted basis, with strong performance in international markets, particularly in the JAPA region.
- The company's credit metrics remained near historically low levels, and the loan portfolio continued to grow.
- American Express maintained a strong balance sheet, allowing for significant capital returns to shareholders.

### Challenges and Uncertainties
- Revenue growth, although positive, was below long-term targets, and the company faces challenges in a modest global economic growth environment and intense competition.
- The quarter saw a decline in travel commissions and fees due to the business travel joint venture no longer being consolidated in the P&L.
- There are uncertainties related to macroeconomic trends, including the impact of declining gas prices and currency fluctuations.
- The pending loss of the Costco partnership in Canada and ongoing legal issues with the DoJ add to the uncertainties.

### Guidance and Outlook
- Despite these challenges, the company expressed confidence in its ability to maintain EPS growth within its 12% to 15% target range through various levers such as cost control, share repurchases, and strategic investments.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's solid financial performance, disciplined expense control, and strong balance sheet are positives. However, the below-target revenue growth, macroeconomic uncertainties, and specific challenges like the Costco partnership loss and legal issues may temper investor enthusiasm.
