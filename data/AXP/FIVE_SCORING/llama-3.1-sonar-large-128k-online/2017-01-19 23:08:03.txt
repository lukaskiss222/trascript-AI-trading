American Express's Q4 2016 earnings call presented several key points that indicate a positive but cautious outlook for the short term. Here are the main reasons for this assessment:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: The company reported adjusted EPS of $5.93 for the full year, exceeding initial expectations and reflecting strong financial performance despite challenges such as the end of the Costco relationship and foreign exchange headwinds[1][3][4].
- **Cost Reduction and Efficiency**: American Express is ahead of schedule in its plan to reduce costs by $1 billion, which has allowed for increased investments in growth initiatives. This cost reduction effort is expected to continue benefiting the company in 2017[1][3][4].
- **Revenue Growth**: Adjusted revenue growth was 6% in Q4, and the company expects to maintain a 5% compound annual growth rate in adjusted revenue for 2017. This growth is driven by strong performances in small business and middle market segments, as well as increasing merchant coverage[1][3][4].
- **Marketing and Promotion**: Despite a record high level of marketing and promotion spending in Q4, the company anticipates moderating this spend in 2017 while still driving solid revenue growth. This suggests a balanced approach to spending and growth[1][3].
- **Competitive Environment**: While the competitive landscape remains challenging, American Express feels confident in its value propositions and brand strength, which are expected to continue driving long-term customer relationships and sustainable revenue growth[1][4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial performance, cost reduction efforts, and ongoing growth initiatives.
