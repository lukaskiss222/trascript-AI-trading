The American Express Q4 2009 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the short term. Here are the key points:

## Positive Indicators
- Billed business grew 8% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-adjusted basis, marking the first positive growth rate since the third quarter of 2008[4].
- Cardmember spending showed a strong rebound, particularly in December, with US retail online spending up 11% year-over-year[4].
- Credit metrics improved, with lower write-off rates and past-due accounts, contributing to a significant reduction in provisions[4].
- The company is maintaining strong liquidity and capital ratios, above regulatory benchmarks[4].

## Challenges and Uncertainties
- The economic environment remains uncertain, with high unemployment levels expected to continue, which could impact credit metrics[4].
- The Credit Card Act will likely reduce net interest yields over the next few quarters[4].
- The company faces increased regulatory scrutiny and potential impacts from new legislation[4].

## Management's Strategy and Outlook
- American Express is focusing on investing in growth initiatives, including premium lending products, charge card marketing, and expanding merchant acceptance and data management capabilities[4].
- The company is cautious but optimistic about the global economy's gradual recovery and its ability to drive growth and improve credit metrics[4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the improving credit metrics, strong billed business growth, and the company's strategic investments. However, the ongoing economic uncertainties and regulatory challenges might temper this optimism slightly.
