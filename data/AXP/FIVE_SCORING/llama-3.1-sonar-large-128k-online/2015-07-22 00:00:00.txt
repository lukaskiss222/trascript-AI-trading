The American Express Q2 2015 earnings call reveals several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

### Mixed Earnings Performance
- The company reported solid core underlying earnings performance, but this was impacted by discrete items such as the strong U.S. dollar, changes in co-brand partnerships, and the initial stages of increased spending on growth initiatives. EPS was relatively consistent with the prior year, but net income was down 4% due to prior year benefits from the Business Travel joint venture[Transcript].

### Guidance and Outlook
- The full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged, with expectations for EPS to be flat to modestly down. The company anticipates negative EPS growth in the second half of the year due to increased spending on growth initiatives and other factors[Transcript].

### Foreign Exchange Impact
- The stronger U.S. dollar significantly impacted reported results, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points. This impact is expected to continue into the third quarter but ease in the fourth quarter as the company laps the significant dollar strengthening from the previous year[Transcript].

### Cost and Expense Management
- Despite the complexities, the company managed expenses well, with reported expenses down 4% and adjusted operating expenses decreasing by 5%. However, marketing and promotion expenses are expected to increase substantially in the second half of the year[Transcript].

### Growth Initiatives and Strategic Focus
- American Express is investing heavily in growth initiatives, including the launch of the Plenti Loyalty Coalition Program, expansion of the OptBlue program, and other digital enhancements. These efforts are aimed at long-term growth but may not yield immediate positive results in the short term[Transcript].

Given these points, the short-term impact on American Express's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative due to:

- The anticipated decline in EPS growth in the second half of 2015
- Continued headwinds from foreign exchange rates
- Elevated spending on growth initiatives that may not immediately translate to higher earnings

However, the company's solid core performance, disciplined expense control, and strong capital position suggest that these short-term challenges are part of a broader strategy aimed at long-term growth.
