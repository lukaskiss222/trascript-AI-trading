The American Express Q1 2010 earnings call presents several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Strong Billed Business Growth**: American Express reported a 16% increase in billed business, driven by a strong affluent customer base and corporate card spending. This growth is significantly higher than industry averages and indicates a robust recovery in discretionary spending[4].

2. **Improved Credit Performance**: The company saw lower write-off rates, improved 30-day past due rates, and a release of $500 million in reserves, all of which contribute to improved credit metrics and reduced provision requirements[4].

3. **Effective Cost Management**: Despite increased investments in marketing and promotion, American Express has maintained well-controlled operating expenses. The company is focused on balancing income levels with investments to drive future growth[4].

4. **Positive Outlook and Investments**: The management expressed confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities, with a focus on medium to long-term investments in areas like alternative payments, loyalty programs, and new fee-generating businesses[4].

5. **Strong Capital Position**: American Express maintains strong capital ratios and a healthy liquidity position, which provides a solid foundation for future growth and potential share repurchases or dividend increases[4].

Given these factors, the likely short-term impact on the stock price is positive due to the company's strong financial performance, improved credit metrics, and strategic investments for future growth.
