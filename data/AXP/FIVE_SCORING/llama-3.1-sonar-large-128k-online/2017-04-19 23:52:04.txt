American Express's Q1 2017 earnings call presented several positive indicators that suggest a stable to positive short-term outlook for the stock. Here are the key points:

1. **Revenue Growth**: Despite a 2% decline in total revenues due to the Costco portfolio sale, adjusted revenue growth accelerated to 7% when excluding FX and Costco-related revenues. This outperformed internal expectations, particularly in March, which bodes well for the remainder of the year.

2. **Cost Reduction and Efficiency**: The company has made significant progress in reducing costs, aiming to remove $1 billion from its cost base by the end of 2017. This has helped in maintaining a strong operating leverage and supporting EPS growth.

3. **Loan Growth and Credit Metrics**: Total loans grew by 12% on an FX-adjusted basis, with a strong net interest yield expansion. Credit metrics remained robust, despite a slight increase in lending loss rates, which is expected due to portfolio seasoning.

4. **Card Member Engagement and Rewards**: The company saw strong growth in new card acquisitions, particularly through digital channels, and while rewards costs increased due to enhanced value propositions, this is seen as a strategic investment rather than a negative trend.

5. **International Momentum**: International billings growth remained strong, with double-digit growth rates in several key markets, which is expected to continue despite some regulatory pressures.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with the company demonstrating solid momentum in revenue growth, cost management, and customer engagement. This suggests that the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.

**Rating: 1**
