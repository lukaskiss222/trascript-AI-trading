American Express reported a strong Q2 2018, with several positive indicators that suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. Here are the key points:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: The company saw a 9% increase in revenues and a 25% increase in EPS, exceeding analyst expectations on earnings. This strong performance is driven by broad-based increases in card member spending, fees, and higher loan volumes[1][3].

2. **Strategic Imperatives**: American Express is making solid progress on its four strategic imperatives, including expanding leadership in the premium consumer space, building on its strong position in commercial payments, strengthening its global integrated network, and making the company an essential part of customers' digital lives. These initiatives are driving growth and customer engagement[1].

3. **Marketing and Investments**: The company is investing heavily in marketing and business development, which includes a new global brand campaign and enhanced customer benefits. These investments are expected to drive long-term sustainable revenue and earnings growth[1].

4. **Financial Health**: American Express has a solid financial position, with a common equity tier-1 ratio of 10.1% and plans to resume share buybacks and increase the dividend. This indicates strong capital management and a commitment to returning value to shareholders[1].

5. **Regulatory and Competitive Environment**: Despite regulatory headwinds in certain regions like Europe and Australia, the company is adapting well and seeing strong growth in proprietary billings. The favorable ruling in the antitrust case at the Supreme Court also supports the company's differentiated business model[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
