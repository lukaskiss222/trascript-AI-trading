The American Express Q4 2017 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Revenue and Billings Growth**: The company reported a 9% FX-adjusted revenue growth in Q4, driven by strong billings and loan growth. This momentum is expected to continue into 2018, with guidance suggesting 7% to 8% revenue growth[4].
- **Tax Act Impact**: While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act led to a one-time charge of $2.6 billion, the company expects a lower effective tax rate of approximately 22% in 2018, which will positively impact earnings[2][4].
- **Loan Growth and Credit Metrics**: Loan growth exceeded industry rates, and although lending write-off rates are expected to increase, they are still projected to be below industry averages. This indicates strong net interest income growth and attractive lending economics[4].
- **Customer-Facing Initiatives**: The company plans to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives in 2018, which could enhance growth but may slightly impact EPS guidance[4].
- **Capital Management**: The suspension of share buybacks for the first half of 2018 to rebuild capital ratios, while maintaining dividend payments, suggests a strategic approach to capital management[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short term due to the strong revenue and billings growth, the positive impact of the lower tax rate, and the company's strategic investments in growth initiatives.
