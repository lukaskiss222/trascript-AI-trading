American Express's Q2 2023 earnings call highlighted several positive factors that are likely to support the stock in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Record Revenues and EPS**: The company reported record revenues of $15.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and record EPS of $2.89, also up 12% year-over-year. This strong performance reaffirms their full-year guidance of 15% to 17% revenue growth and EPS of $11 to $11.40[3].
- **Strong Spending Trends**: Card Member spending reached an all-time high, driven by double-digit growth in U.S. Consumer and International Card Member spending. Travel and Entertainment spending continued to be very strong, with restaurant reservations and travel bookings at record levels[3].
- **Premium Customer Base**: The company's premium customer base, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, continues to drive high-quality revenue growth. The credit metrics remain best-in-class, supported by robust risk management and underwriting practices[3].
- **Long-Term Partnerships**: The extension of the Hilton partnership and other strategic partnerships add to the company's long-term growth potential[3].
- **CFO Transition**: While the transition of the CFO role from Jeff Campbell to Christophe Le Caillec might introduce some temporary uncertainty, the team's confidence in the company's growth plan and financial performance was clearly articulated[3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call was positive, indicating continued strength in the company's business model and its ability to achieve long-term growth aspirations.
