The American Express Q2 2012 earnings call presented a mixed picture, but several key points suggest a generally positive outlook for the short term:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Despite a slowing growth rate in billed business, American Express reported a 5% increase in total revenues and a 7% increase on an FX-adjusted basis. EPS from continuing operations rose 7% to $1.15, driven by share buybacks and solid financial performance.

2. **Credit Performance**: The company's credit metrics remain strong, with lending write-off rates decreasing and 30-day past due rates improving. This indicates good credit quality and effective risk management.

3. **Expense Management**: Total expenses were well-controlled, with a 2% growth rate (or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis), excluding the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds. The company is focused on containing operating expenses and achieving long-term operating leverage.

4. **Capital Strength**: American Express maintained strong capital ratios, with a Tier 1 common ratio of 12.8% and significant share repurchases, indicating financial health and flexibility.

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expressed confidence in achieving its long-term financial targets, despite acknowledging the impact of economic uncertainties. They emphasized their ability to adapt and continue investing in the business to drive growth.

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's solid financial performance, strong credit metrics, effective expense management, and robust capital position.
