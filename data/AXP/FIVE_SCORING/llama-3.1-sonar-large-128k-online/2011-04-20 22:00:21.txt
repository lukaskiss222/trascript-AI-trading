The American Express Q1 2011 earnings call presents several positive and some manageable challenges that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Indicators
- **Strong Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Total revenues net of interest expense increased by 7%, and net income rose by 33% year-over-year, driven by strong billed business growth of 17% and improved credit performance.
- **Improved Credit Metrics**: Write-off rates are at historical lows, and reserve releases were significant, indicating continued improvement in credit quality.
- **Robust Spending and Loan Metrics**: Cardmember spending growth was robust, and loan balances have stabilized, reflecting high-quality customer acquisitions and a shift towards premium lending.
- **Strategic Investments**: The company is making substantial investments in digital payments, loyalty programs, and other initiatives that are expected to drive long-term growth.

### Manageable Challenges
- **Expense Management**: Operating expenses are elevated due to investments in growth initiatives, but the company plans to slow the growth of these expenses later in the year and into 2012 as credit reserve releases and settlement payments phase out.
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: There are ongoing regulatory discussions, including the impact of the CARD Act and potential changes from the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA), but no immediate clarity was provided.

### Short-Term Impact
Given the strong earnings, improved credit metrics, and continued investment in growth initiatives, the short-term outlook for American Express is positive. However, the need to manage expenses and regulatory uncertainties might slightly temper the immediate stock price reaction.

### Conclusion
The overall positive performance and strategic positioning of American Express are likely to support the stock price in the short term, despite some manageable challenges.
