The American Express Q1 2014 earnings call presented several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

1. **Strong Earnings and EPS Growth**: Despite modestly lower revenue growth, American Express delivered a 12% increase in net income and a 16% increase in EPS, driven by disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet. This suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock[1].

2. **Revenue Growth and Billings**: While revenue growth was slightly below expectations, billed business growth remained solid, especially outside the U.S. The impact of severe winter weather on U.S. billings is seen as a temporary factor, and the company observed an improvement in the second half of the quarter[1].

3. **Operational Efficiency and Cost Control**: The company maintained tight control over operating expenses, which contributed significantly to its strong earnings performance. However, it was noted that the 4% decline in operating expenses might not be sustainable in the coming quarters[1].

4. **Strategic Initiatives and Growth**: American Express launched several strategic initiatives, including the OptBlue program and the EveryDay credit card, aimed at expanding merchant coverage and attracting new customer segments. These initiatives are expected to contribute positively over the medium to long term[1].

5. **Capital Return and Share Repurchases**: The company was approved by the Fed to return significant capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases, which is generally seen as a positive signal for shareholders[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting the company's ability to manage expenses, return capital to shareholders, and invest in growth initiatives despite some temporary challenges.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to strong earnings, effective cost management, and the initiation of promising growth strategies.
