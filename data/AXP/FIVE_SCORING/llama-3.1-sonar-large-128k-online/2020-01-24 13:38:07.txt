- **Revenue Growth**: American Express reported 9% FX-adjusted revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, marking the 10th straight quarter of such growth. This growth was driven by a well-balanced mix of fee, spend, and lending revenues.
- **Card Fee Growth**: Card fees, the fastest-growing revenue line, increased by 17% for the full year and accelerated to 20% in the fourth quarter. This is attributed to the successful refresh of premium products and strong customer engagement.
- **Customer Acquisition and Engagement**: The company added 11.5 million new proprietary cards in 2019, with 70% of new card members choosing fee-based products. Customer engagement, particularly among millennials, has been strong, with a 26% increase in daily mobile app usage.
- **Network Expansion**: American Express achieved virtual parity coverage in the U.S., with 99% of credit card-accepting merchants now accepting Amex cards. International network expansion is also progressing well, with a focus on key cities and markets.
- **Guidance for 2020**: The company provided guidance for 8% to 10% FX-adjusted revenue growth and EPS of $8.85 to $9.25, reflecting continued confidence in their financial model and strategy.
