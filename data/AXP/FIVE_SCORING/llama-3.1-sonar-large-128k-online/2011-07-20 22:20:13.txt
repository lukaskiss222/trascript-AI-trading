The American Express Company's Q2 2011 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Revenue and Billing Growth**: The company reported a 12% increase in total revenues, driven by an 18% growth in Billed business, which is a positive indicator of the company's performance and market share gain.

2. **Improving Credit Metrics**: The lending net write-off rate improved significantly, and the 30-day past due rates also showed improvement, indicating strong credit performance and lower provisions for losses.

3. **Higher Rewards Costs**: While the increase in rewards expenses due to higher customer engagement and redemption rates could be seen as a short-term negative, the company views this as a positive long-term indicator of customer loyalty and engagement.

4. **Expense Management**: American Express plans to slow the growth of operating expenses as it exits 2011 and enters 2012, which could help in maintaining profitability and improving operating leverage.

5. **Regulatory and Economic Uncertainty**: The company acknowledged the uncertain economic and regulatory environment, including the end of settlement payments from Visa and MasterCard, which might pose challenges in the near future.

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive due to strong revenue growth, improving credit metrics, and the company's ability to manage expenses. However, the higher rewards costs and regulatory uncertainties could introduce some short-term volatility.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term because of the strong performance indicators, despite some short-term challenges.

**Rating: 1**
