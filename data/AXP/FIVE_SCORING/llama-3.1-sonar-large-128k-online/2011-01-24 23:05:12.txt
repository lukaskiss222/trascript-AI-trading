The American Express fourth quarter 2010 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

### Positive Indicators
- Strong billed business growth, with a 15% increase year-over-year, outpacing major competitors and setting record levels for the quarter and full year.
- Improved credit trends, including lower write-off rates and 30-day past due accounts, reflecting the quality of the customer base and risk management actions.
- Significant investments in marketing, technology, and new fee revenue areas, which are expected to drive future growth.
- Robust revenue performance, despite headwinds from loan shrinkage and lower yields, with overall revenues up 4% on a managed basis.
- A strong capital position, with excess cash and marketable securities of $20 billion, and a potential restart of the share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2011.

### Challenges and Headwinds
- Elevated expenses due to investments in growth initiatives, which may continue into 2011, although there is flexibility to adjust these expenses based on business conditions.
- The end of Visa and MasterCard litigation payments in 2011, which will impact year-over-year comparisons and could affect expense ratios.
- Regulatory uncertainties, including the impact of Durbin interchange rules and potential effects on credit and charge card interchange rates.
- Loan growth challenges, with loans down 4% on a managed basis, although there was a sequential increase in the fourth quarter due to seasonal spending.

### Conclusion
Given the strong billed business growth, improved credit trends, and significant investments in future growth areas, American Express is well-positioned for long-term success. However, the short-term impact of elevated expenses, the end of litigation payments, and regulatory uncertainties may introduce some volatility.

### Rating
1

This rating reflects the positive underlying business performance and growth prospects, balanced by the short-term challenges and uncertainties. The stock is likely to experience some volatility but is generally supported by strong fundamentals.
