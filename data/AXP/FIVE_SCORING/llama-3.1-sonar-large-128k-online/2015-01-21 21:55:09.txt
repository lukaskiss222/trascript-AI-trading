The American Express Company's fourth-quarter 2014 earnings call highlighted several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Solid Financial Performance**: American Express reported a 15% increase in Q4 EPS and a 14% increase in full-year EPS, which is within their target range. This solid performance was driven by higher card member spending, modest loan growth, and strong cost controls[3].

2. **Challenges and Headwinds**: The company faces several challenges, including a strengthening U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted revenue growth, softer December retail sales, and lower gas prices. These factors led to a sequential decline in billed business growth[3].

3. **Restructuring and Investments**: The company took a restructuring charge and invested in growth initiatives, including the renewal of the Delta Air Lines partnership, which had an upfront cost but is expected to provide long-term benefits. These actions are part of a broader strategy to increase efficiency and invest in growth opportunities[3].

4. **Regulatory and Competitive Environment**: American Express is navigating a competitive environment for co-branded partnerships and faces regulatory challenges, particularly in the EU. However, the company has a flexible business model that allows it to adapt to these changes[3].

5. **Loan Growth and Credit Metrics**: Loan growth was up 5% year-over-year, but international loan growth was negatively impacted by FX rates. Credit metrics remained strong, with write-off and delinquency rates near historical lows[3].

Given these factors:

- The solid financial performance and disciplined expense control are positive.
- However, the immediate challenges from foreign exchange, softer retail sales, and the impact of the Delta renewal could create short-term volatility.

### Conclusion

The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the mentioned headwinds but is supported by the company's strong financial performance and long-term growth initiatives.
