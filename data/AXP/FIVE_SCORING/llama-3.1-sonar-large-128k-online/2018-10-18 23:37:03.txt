American Express's third-quarter 2018 earnings call highlighted several key positives that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term:

## Strong Revenue and Earnings Growth
- The company reported a 10% increase in adjusted revenues and a 25% increase in EPS, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of at least 8% adjusted revenue growth. This consistent and robust growth indicates strong performance across various segments, including card member spending, fees, and loans[1][4].

## Diverse Growth Drivers
- Growth was broad-based, driven by increases in small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) spending, international consumer spending, and large and global corporate accounts. This diversity suggests a sustainable growth trajectory[1][4].

## Enhanced Value Propositions and Digital Investments
- American Express has been investing heavily in new benefits, services, and digital capabilities, which are generating good momentum. The expanded relationship with PayPal and other digital initiatives are expected to further enhance customer engagement and spending[1][4].

## Positive Outlook and Guidance
- The company raised its full-year 2018 revenue growth guidance to 9-10% and adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30-$7.40, indicating confidence in sustaining high levels of revenue and earnings growth[1][4].

## Strong Credit Metrics and Loan Growth
- Despite a slight uptick in net charge-offs, credit metrics remain strong, and loan growth is robust, with 60% of loan growth coming from existing customers. This suggests a long runway for continued growth in lending while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics[1][4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
