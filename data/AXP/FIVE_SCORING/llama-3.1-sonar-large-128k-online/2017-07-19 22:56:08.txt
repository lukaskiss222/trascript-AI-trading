The earnings transcript for American Express Company indicates several positive trends and some areas of caution that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Adjusted revenue grew by 8% in Q2, exceeding expectations and driven by broad-based growth across diverse segments and geographies.
- **Loan Growth**: Total loans increased by 11% year-over-year, with a long runway for continued growth, particularly among existing customers.
- **Cost Reductions**: The company has made significant progress in reducing costs, with adjusted operating expenses down 4% year-over-year, and is on track to remove $1 billion from the cost base by the end of 2017.
- **Capital Returns**: American Express has returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and has increased its dividend payout and share buyback program.
- **Improved Credit Metrics**: The company maintained best-in-class credit metrics despite loan growth, and the regulatory environment changes in the UK are seen as positive for consumer-friendly practices.

### Areas of Caution:
- **Moderation in Growth**: There is an expectation of stabilization or moderation in revenue growth rates as some drivers, such as yield increases, may not sustain their current pace.
- **Regulatory Environment**: The company faces evolving regulatory challenges in Europe, particularly under PSD2, which could impact their business model and network aspects.
- **Competitive Environment**: The rewards competition remains high, and while American Express has seen success with its platinum card enhancements, it must continue to innovate to maintain its value propositions.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong revenue growth, successful cost reduction efforts, and robust capital returns. However, the moderation in growth expectations and regulatory uncertainties may prevent a more significant rally.
