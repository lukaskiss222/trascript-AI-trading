The American Express Q2 2016 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Billings Growth**: Excluding the impact of Costco and FX, American Express saw solid revenue and billings growth, with adjusted revenue growth of 5% year-to-date, slightly above the 2015 exit rate. However, the loss of the Costco relationship will continue to impact growth rates in the second half of 2016[3].
- **Cost Reduction and Expense Management**: The company is making significant progress in reducing its cost base, with a goal to cut $1 billion by the end of 2017. Despite increased investment spending, overall expenses are well controlled, and the company expects continued cost savings into 2017[3].
- **Loan Growth and Credit Performance**: Loan growth remains strong, especially in the small business and consumer segments, with adjusted loan growth of 13%. Credit metrics are stable, and the company expects some modest upward pressure on write-off rates due to loan growth and portfolio seasoning[3].
- **Investment and Marketing**: The company is increasing its investment in growth initiatives, including marketing and technology, which will elevate expenses in the second half of 2016 but is expected to fall away in 2017. This should support long-term growth and cost savings[3].
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company has revised its full-year 2016 EPS guidance to the high end of its range ($5.40-$5.70) and maintains its outlook for 2017 EPS of at least $5.60. Despite some uncertainty in the second half of 2016, the management is confident in its ability to drive profitable growth[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact due to the solid underlying performance, cost reduction efforts, and strong capital position. However, the elevated expense levels and some uncertainty around the second half of 2016 might temper the immediate reaction.
