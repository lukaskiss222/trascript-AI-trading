The American Express Q1 2016 earnings call presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company's short-term performance. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Billed Business Growth**: Despite the impact of the ending Costco relationship and foreign exchange, American Express saw a modest acceleration in billed business growth to 6% on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, improved to approximately 5%[4].
- **Cost Reduction and Investments**: The company is on track with its cost reduction plans, aiming to remove $1 billion from its expense base by the end of 2017. Elevated investment levels, particularly in marketing and promotion, are expected to continue, but will be spread more evenly across the year[4].
- **Loan Growth and Credit Performance**: Loan growth accelerated, driven by both new and existing customers, with a strong credit performance and low write-off rates. However, there is some upward pressure on write-off rates anticipated due to loan seasoning[4].
- **Merchant Expansion**: Progress in the OptBlue program and other merchant expansion efforts is positive, though the material financial impact is expected to take several years to fully manifest[4].
- **Guidance**: The company reaffirmed its EPS outlook for 2016 and 2017, excluding restructuring charges. There is some caution around the second half of 2016 due to the unprecedented change in the industry, particularly with the transition of the Costco portfolio to Citi[4].

Given these points:

- The company's ability to maintain revenue growth and accelerate billed business, despite headwinds, is a positive sign.
- The focus on cost reduction and efficient investment spending suggests a well-managed approach to navigating Challenges.
- Strong loan growth and good credit performance are additional positives.

However, there are some uncertainties around the second half of the year, particularly related to the Costco transition and broader industry changes.

### Conclusion

The overall tone of the call is positive, with the company making progress on its key initiatives. While there are some short-term uncertainties, the management's confidence in their strategy and the company's ability to adapt suggest a stable or slightly positive short-term outlook.
