Travel and entertainment spending also showed sequential improvement, indicating pent-up demand for consumer travel[3].

- **Robust Credit Performance**: American Express experienced extremely strong credit performance, with write-off dollars down significantly year-over-year. This is attributed to robust risk management practices and the premium nature of their customer base[3].
