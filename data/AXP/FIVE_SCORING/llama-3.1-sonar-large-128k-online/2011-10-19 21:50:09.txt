The American Express Q3 2011 earnings transcript indicates several positive trends and some areas of caution that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Trends
- **Strong Revenue Growth**: Total revenues net of interest expense grew 9%, outpacing competitors, driven by robust billed business growth of 16% and a solid performance in travel sales and other commission fees.
- **Improved Credit Metrics**: Lending write-off rates and 30-day past due rates are at historic lows, reflecting excellent credit performance and a lower risk profile.
- **Investments in Growth**: The company is investing heavily in new business initiatives, digital payments, and global network services, which have shown promising results.
- **Share Repurchases**: American Express increased share repurchases to $1.2 billion in the quarter, indicating strong capital generation and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.

### Areas of Caution
- **Economic Uncertainty**: The economic environment, particularly in Europe, remains uncertain and could impact spending trends and overall growth.
- **Expense Management**: While the company is working to slow operating expense growth, expenses are still at elevated levels, and there is a need to balance investment in growth with expense control.
- **Rewards Cost**: The increase in Membership Rewards expense due to higher redemption rates could continue to impact profitability if not managed effectively.

### Short-Term Impact
Given the strong revenue growth, improved credit metrics, and strategic investments, the short-term outlook for American Express is generally positive. However, the ongoing economic uncertainty and the need to manage expenses and rewards costs cautiously might temper some of the immediate optimism.

### Rating
