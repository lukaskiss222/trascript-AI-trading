Based on my analysis of American Express's Q3 2015 earnings call, I assess a slightly negative short-term impact on the stock price. Key factors include:

1. Slowing revenue growth (3% FX-adjusted vs 5% in Q2) and EPS decline of 11% year-over-year
2. Management tightened full-year EPS guidance to $5.20-$5.35, implying more downside than the previous "flat to modestly down" outlook
3. Continued headwinds from co-brand relationship changes, FX pressure, and lower transaction sizes

However, some positives partially offset these concerns:
- Strong new card acquisition momentum
- Maintaining solid loan growth
- Continued cost discipline
- Healthy capital returns to shareholders

The near-term challenges appear to outweigh the positive developments, suggesting modest stock price pressure over the next 1-2 weeks.
