Based on the Q1 2008 earnings call, American Express demonstrated relatively strong performance despite early signs of credit deterioration and economic weakness. Key positive points include continued strong billings growth (14%), maintained market share gains versus competitors, and management's confidence in achieving 4-6% EPS growth guidance. However, concerning signals include rising credit losses (especially in March), reduced credit lines, slowing payment rates, and management's cautious outlook on U.S. consumer spending. The company's diversified business model and interest rate benefits provide some cushion against credit headwinds.

Given the mixed signals but early stage of credit cycle deterioration and management's conservative stance, I expect a moderately negative short-term stock impact.
