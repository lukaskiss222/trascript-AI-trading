Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express demonstrated solid performance with improving trends in the second half of 2013. Key positives include:

1. Accelerating billed business growth and revenue growth in Q4
2. Strong cost control with operating expenses below 3% growth target
3. Historically low credit metrics
4. Strong capital position allowing significant shareholder returns
5. Strategic initiatives like the Business Travel JV progressing well

However, some challenges remain:
- Revenue growth still below long-term 8% target
- Regulatory environment requiring increased compliance focus
- Economic growth uncertainty

For the short-term (1-2 weeks), I expect a moderately positive impact on the stock price given:
- Better than expected Q4 results
- Positive momentum in key metrics
- Constructive outlook for 2014
- Strong capital return potential
