Based on this detailed earnings call, American Express demonstrated resilient performance despite significant headwinds. While credit metrics deteriorated and spending declined, the company remained profitable with $443M in earnings and showed strong expense control. Management provided cautiously optimistic guidance on credit stabilizing, though writeoffs are expected to increase near-term. Key positives include strong capital ratios, deposit growth, and expense flexibility. However, continued spending weakness and rising unemployment create uncertainty. The company's diversified business model and premium positioning should help weather the downturn, but near-term challenges remain.
