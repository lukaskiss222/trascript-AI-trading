Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express showed mixed but generally positive performance. Key positives include:
- Revenue growth of 5% (7% FX-adjusted) despite economic headwinds
- Strong credit metrics with historically low loss rates
- Well-controlled expenses growing only 2% (4% FX-adjusted)
- Strong capital position allowing continued share buybacks
- Maintained healthy marketing investment levels

However, there were some concerns:
- Billed business growth slowed to 7% (9% FX-adjusted) from higher levels in previous quarters
- Higher accruals for customer refunds 
- Some uncertainty around impact of new surcharging rules

Overall, while growth is moderating, the company appears well-positioned with strong fundamentals and ability to manage through a slower economic environment. Management remained confident in their long-term growth model despite near-term challenges.
