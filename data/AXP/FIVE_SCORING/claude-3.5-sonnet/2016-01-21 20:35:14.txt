Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on American Express's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerning factors include:

1. Lowered guidance for 2016/2017 compared to previous expectations, with management becoming "more cautious" in their outlook due to competitive, economic and regulatory pressures.

2. Acknowledgment that revenue growth did not accelerate as expected in 2015 and admission that performance is "not what we or you are accustomed to" from American Express.

3. Need for significant cost reductions ($1B by end of 2017) and restructuring charges in 2016, indicating deeper challenges than previously communicated.

While there are some positives like the Costco portfolio sale gain and continued strong card acquisition numbers, the overall tone suggests meaningful headwinds and a more challenging path forward than investors previously anticipated. The reduced guidance and need for major cost cuts will likely pressure the stock in the near term.
