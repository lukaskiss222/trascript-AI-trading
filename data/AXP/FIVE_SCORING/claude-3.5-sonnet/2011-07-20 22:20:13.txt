Based on my analysis of the earnings transcript, here are the key points affecting American Express's short-term stock outlook:

Positives:
- Record billed business growth of 18% (15% FX-adjusted) across all segments and regions
- First loan growth since 2008 and best-in-industry credit metrics
- Strong revenue growth of 12% (8% FX-adjusted), meeting long-term target
- Healthy capital position with 12.3% Tier 1 Common ratio

Negatives:
- Significant increase in rewards expenses (up 35%) due to higher redemption rates and costs
- Operating expenses grew 21% (17% FX-adjusted) from continued investments
- Loss of MasterCard/Visa settlement payments ($150M/quarter from MC, $70M/quarter from Visa) ending in Q3/Q4
- Management guidance suggests slowing expense growth but uncertain economic environment

The company showed strong fundamental performance but faces near-term headwinds from higher costs and loss of settlement payments. While credit quality and spending remain robust, the elevated expense growth may pressure margins in coming quarters until cost initiatives take effect.

Rating: [0]

The mixed factors suggest a neutral short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest both the strong revenue growth and rising cost pressures.
