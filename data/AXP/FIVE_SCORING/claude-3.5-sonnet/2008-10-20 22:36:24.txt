Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis for the short-term stock price impact:

Analysis:
American Express faces several significant near-term headwinds:
- Declining consumer spending (September grew only 5%, further slowing in October)
- Rising credit losses expected over next two quarters 
- Funding pressures from elevated LIBOR rates impacting margins
- Plans for restructuring charge in Q4

However, there are some mitigating factors:
- Strong capital position and liquidity resources
- Access to government funding programs 
- Pricing actions and cost reduction plans being implemented
- Core business model remains sound despite cyclical pressures

Conclusion:
While AXP has positioned itself prudently for the downturn, the deteriorating consumer environment and credit quality will likely pressure the stock over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the weaker near-term outlook. The planned Q4 restructuring charge adds additional uncertainty.
