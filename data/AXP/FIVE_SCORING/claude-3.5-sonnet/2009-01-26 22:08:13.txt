Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on American Express's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company remained profitable and demonstrated strong deposit growth and liquidity management, there are several concerning factors: continued deterioration in credit metrics with higher write-offs expected in Q1 and Q2 2009, declining card spending trends (-10% in Q4), and management's cautious outlook for 2009. The restructuring charges and compressed net interest margins also weigh on near-term performance. However, the strong brand, stable discount rate, and adequate capital position help mitigate some downside risks.
