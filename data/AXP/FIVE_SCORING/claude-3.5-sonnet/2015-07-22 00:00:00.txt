Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis:

Key Positives:
- Core underlying earnings performance remains solid with 5% adjusted revenue growth
- Strong international performance (13% growth excluding Canada)
- OptBlue merchant acquisition program showing good progress
- Maintained disciplined expense control and strong capital return to shareholders

Key Concerns:
- Guidance for negative EPS growth in second half of 2015
- Slowing U.S. corporate spending growth
- Significant FX headwinds impacting results
- Increased marketing/promotional spending planned for H2

Looking 1-2 weeks ahead, I believe the stock will likely see modest negative pressure. While core business trends are stable, the guidance for negative EPS growth in H2 2015 and increased spending plans may concern investors in the near-term. The company's cautious tone around corporate spending and continued FX headwinds could also weigh on sentiment.
