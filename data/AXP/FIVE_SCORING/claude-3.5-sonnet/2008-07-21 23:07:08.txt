Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on American Express's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerning factors include:

1. Significant credit deterioration in June beyond management's expectations, particularly in roll rates and charge-offs, with guidance that losses will increase further in Q3/Q4.

2. Management abandoning their previous 4-6% EPS growth forecast due to worsening economic conditions.

3. Broad-based spending slowdown across all consumer segments, including historically resilient affluent customers.

While AXP maintains strong competitive positioning and solid capital levels, the near-term credit and spending headwinds will likely pressure the stock as investors digest the deteriorating fundamentals and reduced guidance.
