Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express delivered strong Q3 results with improving credit metrics, robust spending growth across segments, and continued market share gains. Management expressed confidence in their premium value proposition and ability to navigate regulatory challenges, emphasizing their differentiated spend-centric model versus competitors' lend-centric approaches. While acknowledging regulatory headwinds (DOJ lawsuit, Durbin amendment), they believe their focus on high-spending customers and merchant value proposition positions them well. The increased investments in marketing and business initiatives, coupled with strong spending trends and improving credit, suggest positive momentum. Management's confident tone and concrete evidence of execution should support the stock in the near-term.
