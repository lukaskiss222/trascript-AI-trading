Based on my analysis of American Express's Q2 2014 earnings call, here are the key points that would impact the stock short-term:

Positive factors:
- Strong billing growth of 9% YoY, accelerating from Q1
- Loan growth improved to 6% from 4% in Q1
- Credit metrics remain at historical lows
- Successfully closed Business Travel JV transaction with $626M gain

Concerning factors:
- Management indicates marketing spend will normalize lower in Q3
- Some transaction costs from Business Travel JV will continue into H2
- Discount rate declined 4bps YoY, more than typical 2-3bps annual decline
- Operating expenses expected to grow going forward after hitting low point

Overall: While underlying business trends are solid, much of the Q2 outperformance came from one-time gains and elevated marketing spend that will normalize. The outlook suggests more moderate growth ahead as costs increase.
