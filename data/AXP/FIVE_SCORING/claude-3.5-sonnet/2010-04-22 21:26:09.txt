Based on the earnings transcript, American Express demonstrated strong positive momentum in Q1 2010. Key highlights include:

1. Remarkable spending growth of 16% year-over-year (12% FX-adjusted), significantly outperforming competitors
2. March 2010 was the highest spending March ever, exceeding March 2008 levels
3. Credit metrics showed substantial improvement, allowing $500M in reserve releases
4. Management increased marketing/investment spending while still delivering strong profits
5. Broad-based growth across consumer, commercial and international segments

While some challenges exist (declining loan balances, Card Act impacts on yields), the company's differentiated business model focused on affluent spenders positions it well for continued growth as the economy recovers. Management's confident tone and increased investment spending signal expectations for sustained momentum.

Given the strong spending trends, improving credit, and management's optimistic outlook, the stock is likely to see positive momentum over the next 1-2 weeks.
