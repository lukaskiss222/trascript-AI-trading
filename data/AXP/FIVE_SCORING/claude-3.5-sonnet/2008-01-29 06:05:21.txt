Based on the earnings transcript, here's my analysis for American Express's short-term (1-2 weeks) stock impact:

Key Points:
- Credit deterioration notably worse than expected in Q4, especially in key housing markets like California and Florida
- Lowered 2008 EPS guidance to 4-6% growth vs historical 12-15% target
- Seeing sudden spending slowdown in December (dropped 300 basis points)
- Planning reduced marketing spending for 2008
- Higher loan loss provisions needed as delinquencies rise

However, some offsetting positives:
- Still maintaining strong competitive position
- Benefits from Fed rate cuts could help funding costs
- International portfolio showing improvement
- Maintains flexibility with $70M quarterly VISA settlement payments

The negative guidance revision and credit deterioration will likely pressure the stock in the very near term, though the company remains fundamentally solid longer-term. The market will need time to digest the magnitude of the credit issues.
