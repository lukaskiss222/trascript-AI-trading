Based on my analysis of American Express's Q1 2013 earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong fundamental performance with 7% EPS growth, stable credit metrics at historically low levels, and continued loan growth outpacing the industry despite a sluggish economy.

2. Disciplined expense management with operating expenses up only 1% YoY, showing progress on cost control initiatives while maintaining investment capacity.

3. Strong capital position enabling a 15% dividend increase and significant share buybacks ($4B planned for 2013), demonstrating confidence in future performance.

While revenue growth was modest at 5% FX-adjusted, the company is executing well on controllable factors and maintaining profitability even in a challenging environment. Management's tone was confident and they are delivering on their strategic priorities.
