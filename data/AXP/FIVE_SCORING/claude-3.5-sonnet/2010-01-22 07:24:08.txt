Based on the earnings transcript analysis, American Express showed several positive signals in Q4 2009:

- Billed business grew 8% YoY (4% FX-adjusted), marking the first positive growth since Q3 2008
- Credit metrics improved significantly with charge-offs and delinquencies declining
- Company increased marketing spend and investments for growth
- Strong capital position maintained
- Premium customer spending remained resilient

However, there are some cautionary factors:

- Management remains cautious on economic recovery and unemployment
- Card Act regulations will pressure net interest margins
- Loan balances declined 14% YoY
- Operating expenses increased from investments

Overall, given the strong spending trends, improving credit, and management's confidence to increase growth investments, the stock is likely to react positively in the near-term despite some headwinds.
