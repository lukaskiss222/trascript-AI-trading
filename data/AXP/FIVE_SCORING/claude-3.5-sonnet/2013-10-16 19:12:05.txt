Based on my analysis of the earnings call, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on American Express's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong quarterly performance with revenue growth accelerating to 7% (FX-adjusted), 15% EPS growth, and continued excellent credit metrics while maintaining cost discipline.

2. Management expressed confidence in their ability to balance growth investments with financial targets, while highlighting multiple growth opportunities including the Wells Fargo partnership and international GNS business expansion.

3. The company demonstrated financial strength that allowed them to increase marketing investments while still delivering strong bottom-line results, suggesting sustainable growth momentum.

However, the impact is likely to be moderately rather than strongly positive due to some cautionary notes around government shutdown uncertainties and acknowledgment that certain growth initiatives will take time to materialize.
