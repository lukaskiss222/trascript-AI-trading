Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express delivered strong Q1 results despite modestly slower revenue growth. Key positives include:

- 16% EPS growth driven by disciplined expense control and strong capital position
- Credit metrics remain near historic lows 
- Successful capital plan approval allowing $3.4B in share buybacks
- Strategic initiatives like OptBlue merchant program showing early promise

However, there are some concerns:

- Billings growth slowed to 7% from 9% in Q4, particularly in US small business/corporate
- Higher tax rate expected (mid-30s vs low-30s previously)
- Weather impacts in Q1, though trends improved later in quarter
- Revenue growth remains below long-term 8% target

Given the company's strong execution, capital return plans, and improving trends exiting Q1, while acknowledging some growth headwinds, I expect a modestly positive short-term impact on the stock.
