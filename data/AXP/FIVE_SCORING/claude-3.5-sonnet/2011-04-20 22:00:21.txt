Based on this earnings call transcript, American Express demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators including:

1. Strong spending growth with billed business up 17% (15% FX-adjusted) across all segments
2. Improving credit trends with historically low write-off rates
3. Strong capital position with 11.8% Tier 1 common ratio
4. Plans to restart share buybacks
5. Revenue growth of 7%, outpacing competitors despite flat loan growth

However, there are some headwinds/challenges to consider:

1. Elevated expense levels that need to be brought down
2. End of Visa/MasterCard settlement payments later this year
3. Net interest income declined 9% YoY due to lower yields
4. Required investments in digital/technology initiatives

Overall, while there are some near-term cost pressures, the company's strong competitive position, improving credit metrics, and robust spending volumes suggest the stock should perform well over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the solid results.
