Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Strong spending growth and billings, outpacing competitors despite challenging comparisons
2. Solid revenue growth of 9%, better than issuing competitors
3. Continued improvement in credit metrics with historically low loss rates
4. Strong capital position (12.3% Tier 1) allowing for significant share buybacks
5. Growth in international markets despite European slowdown

However, there are some mixed signals:

1. Higher rewards costs impacting expenses
2. Operating expense ratio remains elevated at 75%
3. Some uncertainty around European growth
4. Lower net interest income due to deleveraging trends

Overall, the results and management commentary suggest continued strong execution of their spend-centric model and ability to maintain premium positioning. The company appears well-positioned to navigate near-term economic uncertainty while investing for growth.
