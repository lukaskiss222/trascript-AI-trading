Based on my analysis of American Express's Q3 2012 earnings call, I predict a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong financial metrics with 4% revenue growth, controlled operating expenses (-2% YoY), and healthy loan growth (6%) despite economic headwinds.

2. Management demonstrated disciplined expense control while still investing in growth initiatives like marketing (9.7% of revenue).

3. Strong capital position (12.7% Tier 1) allowing for continued share buybacks and dividends.

While there are some minor concerns (slower billings growth, weaker T&E spending, potential MR reserve charge), the overall results and outlook suggest continued execution of their premium strategy with controlled expenses. The company's positioning in premium lending and fee-based revenue initiatives provides upside potential.
