Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express demonstrated mixed signals. While they achieved 14% EPS growth in 2014 and maintained strong credit metrics, several headwinds were highlighted for 2015:

Positives:
- Solid 2014 performance with 14% EPS growth
- Strong credit quality and capital position
- Successful renewal of key partnerships (Delta, Starwood)

Negatives:
- Increasing competitive pressures in co-brand space with lower economics
- FX headwinds from strong dollar expected to impact 2015
- Regulatory challenges particularly in EU
- Need for restructuring and cost cutting

Given management's cautious tone about 2015 challenges, expected margin pressure from co-brand renewals, and multiple headwinds ahead, I expect a slight negative impact on the stock price in the near-term.
