Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on American Express's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Solid Q3 results with 12% EPS growth despite revenue headwinds
2. Strong cost control with operating expenses flat year-over-year
3. Credit metrics remain at historically strong levels
4. Expected $700M gain from Concur transaction in Q4/Q1

However, there are some moderating factors:
- Revenue growth of 5% remains below long-term target of 8%
- Some pressure on discount rates from OptBlue program rollout
- Macro uncertainty around global growth

Overall, while not a blowout quarter, AMEX demonstrated strong execution and cost discipline while maintaining healthy fundamentals. The upcoming Concur gain provides a nice tailwind.
