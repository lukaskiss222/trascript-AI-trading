Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express delivered a strong quarter with several positive indicators:

1. Key Positives:
- Broad-based spending growth across segments and regions
- Strong credit metrics outperforming competitors
- Significant marketing investment funded by credit improvements 
- Healthy capital position with 10.7% Tier 1 common ratio
- Double-digit billings growth continuing into July

2. Some Concerns:
- Economic uncertainty and high unemployment remain
- Revenue growth challenged by lower loan balances
- Regulatory changes (CARD Act, financial reform) create some uncertainty
- Higher marketing spend may pressure near-term margins

However, the strong execution, improving credit trends, and management's confident tone about their competitive position suggest the stock should react positively in the near term. The company appears well-positioned to capitalize on an economic recovery while maintaining strong risk management.
