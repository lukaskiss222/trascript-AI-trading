Based on the earnings call transcript, American Express demonstrated strong fundamental performance with 8% revenue growth, stable credit metrics, and continued momentum in billed business growth of 12%. Management expressed confidence in their ability to maintain growth while containing expenses. Key positives include strong capital position, successful stress test results, and significant share buyback authorization. However, some moderating factors include reduced reserve releases, higher rewards costs, and macro uncertainty particularly in Europe. The outlook appears constructive for sustained performance over the next 1-2 weeks.
