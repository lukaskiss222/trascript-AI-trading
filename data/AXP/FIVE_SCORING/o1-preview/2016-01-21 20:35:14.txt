American Express reported disappointing fourth-quarter and full-year results, lowering guidance for 2016 and 2017 due to challenges like the loss of the Costco partnership, increased competition, and regulatory pressures. Management's acknowledgment of these headwinds, along with plans for significant cost reductions and uncertainty about returning to historical growth targets, is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. Therefore, the stock is expected to face downward pressure over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
