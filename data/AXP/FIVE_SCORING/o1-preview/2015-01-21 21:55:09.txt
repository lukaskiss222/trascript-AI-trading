American Express reported strong Q4 and full-year EPS growth, driven by higher card member spending, disciplined expense control, and share repurchases. However, the company highlighted short-term challenges including foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar, increased competition in co-branded partnerships, and a heightened regulatory environment, particularly in the EU. While management remains confident, these factors may offset positive earnings momentum in the immediate term.
