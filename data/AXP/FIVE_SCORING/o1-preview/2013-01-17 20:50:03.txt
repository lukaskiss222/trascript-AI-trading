American Express reported solid fourth-quarter results with a 5% increase in revenue and strong credit metrics, despite the uneven economic environment. Management's focus on controlling operating expenses, aiming for less than 3% growth over the next two years, and returning significant capital to shareholders demonstrates confidence in their strategy. This positive outlook and operational efficiency are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
