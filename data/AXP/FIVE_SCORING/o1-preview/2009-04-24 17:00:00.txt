American Express reported a significant decline in earnings, with revenues down 18% and income from continuing operations down 68%. Credit losses have increased sharply, and management expects further deterioration in credit metrics in the next quarter. While the company is implementing cost-saving measures and maintaining strong capital ratios, the negative outlook on credit losses and declining consumer spending are likely to put short-term pressure on the stock price.
