American Express reported a significant decline in revenues and earnings due to reduced consumer spending and higher credit losses. While slight improvements in credit trends and planned reinvestments in marketing are positive signs, high charge-off rates and uncertainties from new regulations suggest continued short-term challenges. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the short term.
