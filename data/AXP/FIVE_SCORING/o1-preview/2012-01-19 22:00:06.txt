American Express reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year results, with EPS up 15% for the quarter and 22% for the year, exceeding expectations. Revenue growth remained solid at 7%, driven by increased cardmember spending and stable credit metrics at historic lows. While management acknowledged potential challenges ahead due to economic uncertainties and tougher year-over-year comparisons, the company's strong performance and effective expense management suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock.
