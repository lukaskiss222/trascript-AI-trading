American Express reported strong Q1 earnings, with EPS up 16% and net income up 12%, driven by disciplined expense control and substantial share repurchases. Management's positive outlook on improving billed business growth, continued low credit losses, and strategic investments in initiatives like Amex EveryDay and OptBlue suggest momentum. Despite modest revenue growth and higher tax rates, the strong financial performance and upbeat management tone are likely to positively impact the stock in the short term.
