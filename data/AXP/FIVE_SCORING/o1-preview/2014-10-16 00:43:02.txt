American Express reported strong earnings with a 12% increase in EPS, driven by disciplined expense control and share repurchases. Solid billed business growth, low credit losses, and plans to reinvest gains from the Concur transaction into growth initiatives indicate positive momentum. Despite competitive pressures and the loss of the Costco Canada partnership, the company's strong performance and optimistic outlook suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
