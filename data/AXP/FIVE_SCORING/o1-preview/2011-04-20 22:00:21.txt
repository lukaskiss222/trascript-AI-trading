American Express reported strong first-quarter results with income up 33% and record cardmember spending. The company is benefiting from improved credit trends and plans to restart share repurchases, signaling confidence in future performance. While revenue growth is somewhat tempered by lower net interest income, the overall positive financial results and strategic investments suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
