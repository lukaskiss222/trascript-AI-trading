American Express reported strong revenue growth but a decrease in income due to higher credit provisions and increased expenses. The company anticipates rising credit losses and slower spending growth, especially in the U.S., and expects credit losses to increase next quarter. While management maintained their full-year EPS guidance, the challenging economic environment and concerns over credit quality may negatively impact the stock in the short term.
