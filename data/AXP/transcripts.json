Henry - EVP and CFO\nAnalysts: David Hochstim - Bear Stearns Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co. Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. Bruce Harding - Lehman Brothers Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Eric Wasserstrom - UBS Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Scott Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. Brad Ball - Citigroup\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2007 fourth quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Stovall. Please go ahead.\nRon Stovall - SVP IR: Thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. As usual, it's my job to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8K report and in the company's 2006 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the fourth quarter 2007 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our web site at ir.americanexpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that describes the company's managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Daniel Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Express will provide some introductory remarks highlighting the key points related to today's announcement. Once he completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator, who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Thanks, Ron, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. As usual, my remarks today will mostly focus on the results for the fourth quarter as you are already familiar with our results for the first three quarters of the year. However during the Q&A, I will be happy to respond to any question you might have on our full year results in addition to your questions on the quarter. As you've seen in the earnings documents, our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong business growth we reported throughout recent years. As you know, these results reflect the benefits of our multiyear investments in a broad range of business building initiatives which have yielded industry leading performance for the quarter and over the past few years. When you compare our revenue from continuing operations to the fourth quarter of last year, net revenues grew 10%, income decreased 6%, and diluted EPS of $0.71 decreased 3%, but was in line with our previously announced expectations.  For the full year 2007, we reported income from continuing operations of $4 billion, up 12% from 2006, and diluted EPS of $3.39, which rose 16%. ROE for the prior 12 months was 37%. The results for the quarter reflect the significant items that we highlighted in our recent announcement and include the recognition of $700 million after-tax reduction in operating expenses from the $1.1 billion initial payment in the company's litigation settlement with VISA, $89 million after-tax of incremental investments in marketing, promotion and other business building initiatives, $46 million after-tax of litigation-related costs pertaining to the lawsuit against VISA and MasterCard, $31 million after-tax of additional contribution to the American Express Charitable Fund, and a $274 million after-tax credit-related charge which reflected the impact of the weakening economy during the latter part of the quarter. In addition, the quarter included a $430 million after-tax charge to increase the membership rewards liability based on our decision to adopt more of an actuarial-based method to estimate the ultimate redemption rate of rewards points earned by cardmembers.  Last year's fourth quarter included a $42 million after-tax gain related to the rebalancing program within the Travelers Cheque and Gift Card investment portfolio and $45 million of after-tax benefits related to certain foreign losses and the finalization of state tax returns. In addition, both quarters included reengineering costs totalling $10 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus $42 million of after-tax last year. During the quarter and year-to-date, we returned 99% and 88% respectively of total capital generated to our shareholders through repurchase of shares and dividends. Since 1994, we have returned 71% of capital generated to shareholders, which above our 65% long-term target. The 10% revenue growth in the quarter reflects strong double-digit increases in a number of revenue categories, including discount revenue and cardmember lending finance revenues. This growth rate was somewhat suppressed by our higher interest expense. As far as our consolidated results go, they continue to be driven by strong growth in cardmember spending, loans, and cards in force. Billed business growth for the quarter remains strong, even with the slower growth in December that we discussed with you two weeks ago. Each of our customer segments and geographic regions contributed to the 16% growth worldwide, or 13% growth on an FX adjusted basis. Let me give you some more details. In our U.S. proprietary business, Consumer spending grew 10% for the quarter, Small Business spending increased 14%, and Corporate Services volumes improved by 11%. In total, U.S. volumes for retail and everyday spend grew 14%. This category represented about 72% of U.S. billings. Travel and Entertainment-related spending, which accounts for the remainder, rose 9%.  Outside the U.S. proprietary billings billed business grew 11% on an FX adjusted basis. This was driven by 9% growth within our Consumer and Small Business activity and 14% growth within Corporate Services.  Within Global Network Services, billed business rose 39%, driven by continued robust growth both in and outside of the U.S. Worldwide cards in force rose 11%. We added 1.7 million net new cards during the quarter and 8.4 million net new cards since last year. This reflects 5% growth versus last year in proprietary cards, and 35% growth in network partner cards. Spending per proprietary card rose 8% worldwide, even with the suppressing effects of the substantial card additions over the past few years. Our average discount rate of 2.54% decreased slightly from last year, and consistent with seasonal patterns, declined 3 basis points versus last quarter. Net card fee revenues increased 14% due to strong growth in cards as well as higher average fee per card. Travel commissions and fees increased 14%, reflecting an 18% increase in travel sales. Once again, we saw our strong growth in cardmember spending generate a high level of loan growth. Worldwide lending balances on an own basis rose 26%. On a managed basis, balances grew 22% on 23% growth in the U.S. and a 15% increase in our non-U.S. portfolios. This growth continues to reflect the flow-through of particularly strong spending levels within our co-brand, lending on charge and other credit card relationships as well as successful acquisition efforts surrounding these products. In the U.S. some of this growth is also related to the slowdown in payment rates which we believe is consistent with the weaker economic environment. While we know that some of you have questioned the logic of such strong growth in this environment, we are confident in the attractive underlying economics of this business growth through the cycle.  Securitization income decreased 6% as higher finance charge and fee revenue, driven by a greater average balance of securitized loans, was more than offset by higher write-offs and a decrease in the valuation of the interest only strip that was included in this quarter's credit-related charge. Cardmember lending finance revenues rose 27% on growth of the owned portfolio.  Interest expense increased 34%. This was due to a 35% increase in funding costs within the lending business and a 33% increase within the charge card and other interest expense line. Most of this reflects the volume increases within the business, however, as we discussed with you during the year, the higher interest expense was also driven by the expiration of some fixed-rate debt and hedges at the end of the 2006. Specifically, fixed-rate debt and hedges within the U.S. card business declined by $11 billion. The effective funding rate on that amount was 3.2%. It was replaced by funding based on higher market rates of approximately 5.1% in the quarter. This resulted in about $48 million of incremental expense in the quarter versus last year. Marketing, promotions, rewards and cardmember services expense increased 57%, reflecting the charge to increase the membership rewards reserve and the incremental investment in marketing and promotions resulting from the VISA settlement. The increase also reflects higher volumes related to rewards cards.  As you can see within our segment results, our marketing efforts this past quarter were again somewhat more focused on spending outside of the U.S. versus the more U.S.-oriented investment activity during the first half of the year.  The increase in rewards costs continues to reflect our strong spending growth and increasing cardmember participation. The charge taken this quarter increases the global ultimate redemption rate assumption for the program participants - the assumption for current program participants - within the reserve model to approximately 90%. We believe this is consistent with the increased usage of the program by our cardmembers and our plan to continually vigorously utilize rewards as a centrepiece of our competitive strategy. Human resource expense increased 6% due to merit increases, greater benefit costs, and a higher number of employees, primarily resulting from customer service initiatives and an acquisition within corporate services.  The growth in the remaining operating expenses reflect the impact of increased volumes within our technology and cardmember service activity and shows the underlying operating expense has continued to be well controlled.  The total provision for losses and benefits increased 70% versus last year, and the lending provision increased 100% and the charge provision rose 51% and other provisions decreased 2%. The increase in lending provision reflects the credit-related charge, higher loan volumes, and increased past due and write-off rates in the U.S. portfolio.  Delinquencies for the U.S. Card Services segment increased from 2.9% of managed loans in the third quarter to 3.2% in the fourth quarter '07. And write-off rates on a managed basis for this segment also increased from 3.7% in the third quarter to 4.3% in the fourth quarter '07. As we said, the changes that we saw in the credit performance are reflective of the external economic environment and don't specifically stem from individual products or cardmember tenure segments, although, as you would expect, we have seen greater deterioration in geographic areas where the housing market has contracted more severely such as California and Florida. We have also seen a somewhat higher level of weakness in accounts that have not yet gone through the natural seasoning process as well as in lower FICO bands within the portfolio. The increase in the charge card provision also reflects the credit-related charge in volume growth, however, the deterioration we saw during the quarter here was less than we experienced in the lending portfolio. The consolidated tax rate of 26% for the quarter compares with a 25% rate last year.  With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. While the quarter's earnings growth reflects the negative impacts of the significant items I referenced earlier, we did deliver strong revenue growth and excellent returns while continuing to invest in key business initiatives and maintain balance sheet strength. And for the full year, earnings were strong despite the fourth quarter impact. Business metric performance, like growth in billed business and loan balance, continues to be in the top tier of the industry. The gap between our growth rate and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our ongoing marketing and rewards investments over the past several years. While losses and past-due levels within the U.S. lending portfolio have trended higher, our credit quality indicators compare favorably to the industry and continue to reflect the benefits from our focus on the premium market sectors. As we've discussed before, our write-off rate calculations include principal, accrued interest, and accrued fees verse the principal only calculations that our competitors generally publish and utilize. This serves to overstate our comparable rate by about 20%. As previously disclosed, our business plan for 2008 assumes a moderately weaker U.S. economy and reflects the slowing billed business growth and rising write-off rates that we saw during the latter part of the quarter. We assume billed business growth of 8% to 10% compared to the 10% FX adjusted growth we saw in December. We also assume that the managed U.S. lending write-off rate will be in the 5.1% to 5.3% range for the year versus the 4.3% in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect to pull back on certain discretionary expenses and assume marketing and promotion expense will be somewhat below the 2007 levels. We believe that spending at this level will allow us to capitalize on competitive opportunities and position the company to continue to gain share over the medium to long term. The interest expense levels that impacted us in 2008 are obviously dependent upon the credit market environment, however, our plan does not reflect last week's Fed rate cut. The plan also considers the availability of the $70 million per quarter settlement-related payments from VISA. Here, we are optimistic that the U.S. G&S business is well positioned to meet the quarterly performance criteria necessary to receive these payments. This provides us with the additional flexibility within the plan so if the business is performing at the strong end of our assumptions, we will likely invest these payments. But if performance is at the weak end, we can use them to bolster the bottom line. In this type of business scenario, we believe the flexibility that we have built into our business model generally positions us to grow EPS in the 10% to 12% range, however, given the comparisons to a year that included several significant positive items, the plan assumes 2008 reported EPS will increase in the 4% to 6% range.  The quarterly year-over-year EPS comparisons are likely to show significant variances, with the 2008 first quarter earnings level forecasted to be below that of last year, in part as a result of the relatively low level of marketing spending in the fourth quarter of 2007.  These results are based on the assumption that the build business growth and write-off rates in the plan are met, and that macro economic indicators such as employment, consumer spending and funding costs do not deteriorate significantly from current levels. But we do recognize that the plan assumptions that we've made will have to change if the economy varies from our expectation. In that case, we will consider what the economic environment is, be focused on the long-term health of the franchise, and we will take actions that are appropriate depending on the circumstances. Our investment optimization process positions us to identify opportunities to increase or decrease our business building investments quickly and thoughtfully. We have a strong planning and forecasting process which dynamically incorporates changes in the environmental conditions, and we remain focused on reengineering, which in recent years has yielded a far leaner expense base. Collectively, we believe these efforts will help us to maximize our ability to invest in key growth opportunities even in a difficult economic environment. We will continue to manage the company for the long-term interests of the shareholders and be guided by our on-average and overtime financial objectives. Since we set our targets in 1993, we have generally performed consistent with those goals, and, in fact, have outperformed them in recent years. While we expect our 2008 EPS growth will fall below our 12% to 15% targeted growth range, we continue to believe that this is still an appropriate target for the medium to long term. And despite the tougher environment, our plan for 2008 anticipates that our return on equity should be consistent with our 33% to 36% target. Given our industry leading results in recent years and the product, customer and geographic breadth of our franchise, we believe we are well positioned to execute against our growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance our short, medium and long-term business objectives and financial goals. Thank you for listening. We are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of David Hochstim representing Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Yeah, hi. I'm wondering, could you give us some sense of how billed business growth was in January or January to date, and could you kind of clarify or maybe speak more about what the trend was like over the month of December. Was it appreciably worse in the last two weeks or just dropped off December 1?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: No, David, I think in December, as we indicated, it was a sudden drop - it dropped about 300 basis points from a level that was running at about 13% down to about 10%. We saw the drop over the course of December, although it was probably a little bit more noticeable towards the end of December.  In terms of what's taken place since the forecast that we made the announcement of our targets for 2008, which was about two and a half weeks ago, things are dimensionally the same as they were at the time that we shared with you our forecast for 2008. So everything, things are dimensionally the same currently as they were at the time of our forecast.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Okay. And then could you just clarify what you were saying about marketing spending in '08? You reported $2.7 billion roughly in the fourth quarter, and that included, I guess, the $685 million expense. Is there anything else in that number, so it's a little over $2 billion, then, if you take that out?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Yes, I think what we've said is we anticipate that marketing promotion expenditures in 2008 would be slightly below what we spent in 2007.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Including the $685?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Yes.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Okay. And just to clarify, so in the fourth quarter I thought you said it was running at about 13% rate for the quarter. Was it 13% in the first two months?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: No. I think what we said is we saw a sudden drop in December of about 300 basis points.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Okay. All right, thanks.\nOperator: And next we'll go to the line of Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMeredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.: Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions, and I hope I'm not re-asking David's question, but this is going back to the last question. So again, I have two questions. This is to clarify something that you had said about a slowdown in spending. Is it possible that there is a numerator-denominator effect going on that changed your previous budget to the extent that the numerator is tracking along as you guys had expected in terms of the level of charge-offs but because the slowing slowed down on a pronounced basis? Is there a spending slowdown on a pronounced basis towards the end of December, the net effect results in a higher charge-off rate?  Because I want to clarify, in the master trust data, I don't see a material drop off in payment rates, and as someone who looks at that as a leading indicator, I look at the rest of the card issuers and you also don't see a material drop off in payment rates.  I'm just trying to connect the dots here, and then after which I'd like to - after your response, I'd like to ask a follow-up question, please.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Okay. So I don't think it's a numerator-denominator effect. I think the denominator stays pretty much the same. I think we saw an increase in writeoffs, and that's what's leading to the higher write-off rate. Now as it relates to the trust compared to the owned portfolio, the accounts that are in the trust are more seasoned, okay? Last time we added accounts to the trust was in October of '06, and the accounts we put in at that time had been in the franchise for a little while. So most of the accounts that you have in the trust have been with us for probably two years plus. So the new accounts that are being added are really on the owned side, and in that you'll see the normal seasoning that takes place there that you're not seeing in the trust. And that's why I think you're probably seeing not the same level of change in write-offs in the trust that you're seeing in the owned portfolio.\nMeredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, would that suggest, though, Dan, that the accounts originated over the last couple of years when you had the accelerated loan growth are, in fact, performing worse? Because in the last call you'd said that they were performing like the others.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: No. I think if you look at the - using FICO scores as an indicator - the accounts that we are acquiring in 2007 have the same quality makeup as the accounts that we acquired in 2006. So we haven't changed our criteria in terms of the customers that we bring in from our creditworthiness perspective. And what I said last time is that we saw deterioration really across all categories, although we saw it a little bit more in those categories where people are kind of going through the normal seasoning process, okay?\nMeredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Now, that's just a general as you look at the whole portfolio. If you want to compare the trust to the owned receivables, then what I said a minute ago comes into play in that the folks in the trust are probably more tenured.\nMeredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, I got that. So here's my second question, which is a nuanced question to the extent of regulators and accountants, this credit cycle versus last credit cycle, as the accountants and regulators now require you to basically provide as charge-offs and maybe have a quarter - it seems like a quarter horizon - in terms of expected charge-offs, do you assume - and this is an industry question - that that then will be responsible for more or less predictability in earnings? Is that a contributing factor at all?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So we have not changed our methodology for providing for credit losses anytime really in the last several years. We use historical information as the guidepost in terms of establishing our reserves. Now our policy also has a factor in there that to the extent we see a trend that's not being captured in the historical information, then we use management judgment. And so in the fourth quarter, that's exactly what we did. We looked at the increase in delinquencies. We looked at what that would do if we stayed simply with our models in terms of driving coverage ratios down. We said we didn't think that made sense given that we were seeing deterioration, and so we actually put up a provision to bring our coverage ratios back up to a level that we thought was appropriate. So what we did in the fourth quarter has nothing to do with changes from either accountants or regulators. It's management exercising their judgment to bring coverage ratios up to an appropriate level.\nMeredith Whitney - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Next we will go to Chris Brendler's line, with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Thanks. Good afternoon.  Could you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing in the charge card business? I was a little bit surprised to see not necessarily the delinquency trend there because I think it's a 90-plus number, but maybe beneath the surface, if you could talk about the credit trends in the charge card business because the reserve bill was quite substantial, more than I was looking for. I would think that portfolio would be holding up better.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So the charge card portfolio is holding up better than what we're seeing on the lending side. We did see a little bit of change in the credit metrics, and so again, we exercised judgment as it relates to that portfolio to ensure that we continue to show the same kind of appropriate coverage ratios, just like we did on the lending side. So we did see some movement from a credit metric perspective. We think the impact will be less there than on the lending side. And as we go forward in terms of our ability to manage the charge card portfolio, it's very high because every charge that a cardmember looks to make, we're basically making a decision about whether we let that charge go through or not. So we think we have a very good ability to control credit on the charge card portfolio.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: And along those lines and a follow-up to Meredith's question on the growth in the credit card business and the deterioration that you're seeing on the on-book recently originated portfolio, how can you tell if your models are calibrated to sort of a higher-quality customer and you're encouraging spending, how do you try to limit spending, I guess, when the cycle turns, it turns out to be spending and loan growth that you didn't want?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Let's take a longer view of history in terms of the decisions we've made to put customers on the books. I think we have been investing heavily over a multiyear period to bring in new customers. The result of that is our cards and loan growth has been very strong over the last several years. Our billings growth has been very successful, and notably above what our competition has accomplished. And as a result, we've had the flow-through of that into our loan portfolio. The economic gain that we've realized over the last several years by outperforming the competition in terms of both billings and loan growth is substantial. We think we continue to have good credit capability. We are monitoring the behavior of our customers very closely. And so we think those decisions are valid and we have good underlying economics to the investment that we have made.  So we're very comfortable with what we've done to date. You know, another way to look at it would be what were our expectations when we decided to bring owned groups to customers in either 2005, 2006 or 2007, and based on the assumptions of how many cards we would get, what their spending would be, what loan balances would be, and what write-offs would be, they're very attractive from a financial perspective. Even if you took those same models and plugged in much higher write-off rates for 2008 and 2009, they continue to be very attractive financial decisions. So I thin the investments we've made have done very well for us, put us in a leadership position, and now, if we have a down cycle in the economy, we just have to manage our way through that very smartly in terms of who we allow to spend and at what levels we allow them to spend.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Are you tightening up a little more right now on that last point?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So I think we are very focused on certain geographies where there has been a greater deterioration in home prices. We are also focused on certain industries that may be more inclined to have a downturn. So we're being very targeted in terms of how we're controlling spending. But at the same time, on a broader base we're being very focused in terms of what are the right credit criterias we should use, even for the broad population.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Bruce Harding's line, with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.\nBruce Harding - Lehman Brothers: You said that you're not really - you didn't factor in the Fed ease or any perspective Fed eases into your model, and then you talked about how you would treat the $70 million quarterly payment.  Can you speak to how you see the Fed ease impacting the model going forward now that's happened and any perspective, you know, the sort of 50 that's highly expected, and any perspective from here, both on your P&L and how your consumer's ability to pay in the last quarter or two may be impacted? And also whether or not as far as any pricing or interest rate changes you may put into place, you know, based on what you did in the last recession.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Well, you know, obviously to the extent the Fed eases prices, that's a clear benefit for us. But as you know, the credit markets are pretty volatile right now, and while Fed has improved, we have also seen credit spreads above LIBOR that we pay expand, which is moderating or mitigating the benefits that we're seeing. In our business, there's something of a built-in hedge here. To the extent credit gets worse, you have easing on the Fed side and you have lower interest, which helps to mitigate what you're seeing from the slow economy in terms of credit losses. So that's kind of a built-in hedge in the process. So as we go forward in evaluating what level we continue to invest in the business, we will certainly take into effect both the benefits that we're reaping from a lower Fed rate, what's happening on the credit side, and what knock-on effect the actions by the government will have on the broader economy in terms of their ability to pay. So we don't ever manage the business by looking at one line. You really need to look across all the lines - what's happening in billings, what's happening in credit, what's happening in interest rates. And as I said, we feel we have a very strong ability for forecasting and integrating these changes in the environment into our forecast that help us react to all the things that are happening, both in the marketplace and within our business.\nOperator: Let's go to the next question. Our next question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Thanks. Just a follow up on that question on the funding costs. You know, LIBOR's moved down quite a bit, you know, year-to-date, and I was just wondering, I mean, how should we think about that in terms of flowing through to the interest margin in the first quarter? I think it's down over 65 basis points. And then also, secondly, just on international credit quality, I saw there was a pretty marked improvement in the charge-off rate internationally on the lending portfolio. Just wondering if you could comment on that. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Okay. So, you know, I think if you look at the curve, we certainly are going to have a benefit, you know, based on the curve, the biggest benefit actually does fall in the first quarter, so we're taking that into consideration in our thinking as we move through the quarter. But we have to take into effect all the other aspects that are taking place at the same time. Then again, we have a pretty good ability to react from an investment point of view, but that generally takes some lead time of a couple months to actually react. So when there's some movement in external factors that are going to flow through our P&L, we can mitigate them or adjust for them to some extent, but not necessarily fully in all cases. But we try to do it as thoughtfully as we can. You always have to be careful that you don't look at a couple days or a week or two as a trend because it's just in the normal course of the business there is a certain amount of bounciness in daily or weekly information that we receive. As it relates to your observation on international, you're absolutely right. Our international credit metrics are improved from where we have been. I think there's been an emphasis in the international markets on our lending portfolios, in terms of controlling credit well, and an emphasis on the premium sector. And I think this emphasis on the premium sector is actually paying dividends to us, and you're seeing that in the results, in particular the credit metrics that you see there.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Is there a specific region that saw more improvement than others?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So on the spot, I don't recall specifically, but in our conversations, there wasn't a call out of a specific region that was acting differently than the others. So I think it was pretty broad based, although I will remind you that last year we probably had higher credit losses in the U.K. and possibly in Taiwan as well. So there's an absence of those higher losses in our current numbers.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. And I'm sorry, just one last question. In the marketing line, are the - the one-times are a boost in incremental business building costs. Is that in the rewards line?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So the line in the P&L is marketing, promotions and rewards. The incremental boost in the fourth quarter would be on that line.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, so that's in addition to the rewards liability increase?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Yes. So let me just go back to a question that someone asked before. When you think about when I was talking about marketing and promotion being slightly below 2007 levels, you shouldn't be looking at that total line because that total line includes rewards, it includes the $685 million that we put up, okay? I'm not talking about either rewards or that addition to the reserve. I'm talking about the marketing promotion aspect within that line being slightly below 2007 levels. So if I didn't answer that precisely before, I just want to clarify.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Eric Wasserstrom's line, representing UBS AG. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom - UBS: Just to get back to some of these funding issues, are you contemplating any change in the mix of how you fund the business given the current volatility in the credit markets?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So we borrow both short-term instruments and commercial paper. We do some unsecured lending that ranges from one year up to 10 years and sometimes a little longer. We also fund with some deposits as well as securitizations. So as I said before, we've kind of come through this funding - even though there's a lot of stress in the marketplace - very cleanly. We've been able to fund at the levels that we desire to in commercial paper and short-term. In the unsecured longer-term kind of 10-year money, there's money there, and we've been able to fund in securitization or ABS at the levels that we want to. Since July, the unsecured - the 5-year market - really hasn't been there or only been there in limited amounts, so as we go forward, if that continues to be the case, we would tend to do some more funding in the unsecured 10-year and possibly do higher levels of securitization than we've done in the past. So as we think about our funding, that's how we're thinking about it as we go through 2008.\nEric Wasserstrom - UBS: Does that mix - I'm just trying to think about that, but does that mix imply sort of a naturally higher funding cost given the longer duration?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Well, you know, to the extent we put a 10-year deal on and credit spreads are higher than normal, that would drive the rate up. On the other hand, you know, today we're probably a little bit below what historical levels are, right? So those two might, you know, balance off. If we borrow in the ABS market - we actually did a deal a couple of weeks ago where we did a AAA piece of a securitization for $2.5 billion and we were about 45 basis points above LIBOR, which is a pretty good trade. And securitizations generally tend to be kind of, again, in a 3- to 5-year range. So to the extent you had to pay up on spread there, it would roll off a little bit more quickly.\nEric Wasserstrom - UBS: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we will go to the line of Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Thanks. I wanted to clarify two numbers quickly, then a follow up strategic question. On the marketing spend, I'm sorry, I was unclear, the $2.7 billion that you spent this year, if you back out the $685, you're at $2 billion. Is it slightly less than the $2 billion you expect to spend in 2008?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: The $2.7 billion is a quarterly number that is both marketing promotion and rewards, including the $685 million.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: So looking at the full year, including the $685, you expect to spend a little bit less than that.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: No. I'm not being successful here. So that line has marketing and promotion and rewards costs. So rewards of being - membership rewards costs. Those are two elements on that line, okay?\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Right.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: I'm not talking about rewards.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: I'm not talking about the $685. \nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: I'm talking about marketing and promotion. So marketing and promotion only, not the rewards piece, in 2008, we think we will spend slightly less than what we spent in 2007.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So I wasn't addressing the $2.7 billion in the quarter.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then on the 4% to 6% EPS growth, is that on the $3.42, on top of the $3.42 from continuing operations?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: I think $3.39 is our continuing operations diluted EPS. And the 4% to 6% on a reported basis would be offset in the $3.39 number. Again, I'll remind you that in 2007, there's a number of significant benefits that we've culled out for you in the past, and if we've excluded those, or if we think about just our business model, we would think with the elements that we've laid out of 8% to 10% billed business growth, 1.5% to 1.3% write-offs rates, our business model has the flexibility to generate between 10% and 12% EPS growth, okay? However, because of the significant items, gain items, that we had in 2007, that would convert into a reported growth rate of between 4% and 6% off of the $3.39. \nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Yeah, I got that. And then on the international business and the long-term growth, I guess, of the international business, your cards outstanding were only up 3% year-over-year. Was there during the course of the year, I don't recall, is there a reason why the card growth is only 3% internationally. I mean, it would seem that you should have much higher opportunities to grow outside the U.S., but maybe just with the brand name being American Express you don't have the same type of growth opportunities that a MasterCard or a VISA may have, otherwise we'd be seeing faster growth rates of the cards and, I think, long-term of the billed business and profits.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Yes, I think the 3% is an average for the year. I think we had been improving as we go through the year. I think it's a reflection of what I spoke to before. I think we have been very careful in terms of our lending business, in terms of how we grow that. And there has been more of a focus on the premium market, and so the quality of the cards we've been bringing in we think is very good. I think that's reflective of what you see in terms of the fees per card, which have been improving. I think it's a reflection of our focus on the premium sector, why the card growth rate is not higher internationally.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will go to Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding small business, I think in the past it's been referred to kind of as an early indicator of overall credit trends in the economy. Can you talk a little bit more about small business credit metrics? Are you seeing - the spend looked pretty strong - maybe expectations for small business spend?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: In prior slowdowns, we have seen that small business was kind of a leading indicator. However, in 2007 that was not the case. So this is different than the slowdown that we saw in 2001. That was led by business. The 9/11 event had a dramatic impact on travel, in particular. This is a different type of recession. It was started by housing and subprime mortgages, and the way it's rolled out to us, we had small business is not a leading indicator.  And as we said, we saw a sudden drop in December in the U.S. of both consumer and small business, so small business behaved very similar to what we saw in the Consumer segment in the month of December.\nScott Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Okay. And one follow-up question regarding the tax rate. I guess it was 27% for the year in '07 and about 30% in '06. Do you see it holding stable about where it is today?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: You know, what we said is we would normally expect our tax rate to be around 30% or 31%. This year there were a number of tax benefits that we realized in the earlier quarters. We broke those out separately so that you could see them. So this year in the second quarter, we had a gain of $65 million related to an IRS settlement, and we also had a tax benefit in the third quarter of about $75 million.  So against that we did some investment spending in the second quarter, but those two large benefits that were recorded in the second and third quarter is what really took us down below that 30% or 31%. That's the norm in 2007. \nScott Valentin - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Okay, thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: And we will go to Brad Ball's line, representing Citi. Please go ahead.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Hi, Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Hi, Brad.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Is there any reason for the decline in the margin quarter-to-quarter besides the seasonality - the discount rate, not the margin, excuse me.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So the - no. I mean, so we saw the normal 300 basis point drop - or 3 basis point drop - from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which is seasonal. We did see a slight drop year-over-year of 1 basis point from last year to this year.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay, so nothing outside of seasonal trends between third and fourth quarters?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: No, no, no.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: Primarily driven by seasonal trends.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: And separately, you were talking earlier about the differences between your trust and your owned portfolios, indicating the trust was a little more seasoned. The trust also has a relatively high proportion in some of those high-risk HPA markets like California and Florida - I think 17% and 9%, respectively.  Could you give us some view of what the owned portfolio looks like relative to geographic exposure?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: That's something that we haven't historically disclosed. I don't honestly know those numbers off the top of my head.  You know, I think the other thing as it relates to the trust is those write-off rates are not shown net of recoveries. As we've indicated, you know, another thing that we've seen is a little bit of slowdown in pay down. You know, you see that coming through the owned portfolio but you wouldn't see it in the trust data. So that's another thing to think about when you compare the two.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay, but you can't give us a sense as to what the managed exposure is to California or Florida?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So that's something we'll think about in terms of the financial community meeting, whether that's a disclosure that we might be able to make.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay. And then just finally, I know there's been a couple of questions about where your expense levers are in that marketing, promotion and reward line. You know, I understand that you don't break that out for competitive reasons, but how are we to assess how effective you've been at managing that expense when in a given quarter maybe the marketing and promotion is down but rewards are up and they offset? Is there a way you're going to give us some visibility around your ability to manage expenses during this tougher time?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: I guess I'd go back to the first quarter of 2007. You know, we said we have the ability to be pretty surgical in terms of when we have to adjust our investment spending so that whatever changes we make minimize the impact on our metric and our future growth. And I think in the first quarter, we dropped marketing expenses pretty dramatically. And as you saw in the second, third and fourth quarter, that we really didn't see a drop off in metrics. So we think we have very good capabilities in terms of when we need to make adjustments, either reducing or increasing or even shifting.  So we can possibly be shifting spending, investment spending, within the U.S. consumer business to markets that are not seeing the deterioration of housing or to our B2B businesses, where we haven't seen an impact yet, or to the international markets. So I think we have some pretty good tools here. I think we demonstrated that in the first quarter of last year. If there's in fact a decline and a slowdown in the economy in '08, we'll utilize those skills again. Now, when we have a drop in marketing, it doesn't necessarily mean we have an increase in our rewards costs. Our rewards costs should generally be driven by volumes, and be increasing at the same rate as our business is increasing.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay, great. And then just one last one before I let you go. In your response to one of your earlier questions, I think you used the word recession in the present tense. Are you saying that we are in a recession right now? And even if you're not, what do you think unemployment rate goes to by the end of '08?\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So, you know, I don't want to try to be an economist because I'm not. And I'm not intending to make any statement about whether we're in a recession or not in a recession or forecast whether we will be in the future. I think we set out the guidance that we did, which we said was basically based on what we saw in December and a modest deterioration in the economy, and that's really the basis for our forecast. I'm not attempting to make any statements about the economic condition today or what it might be over the course of 2008.\nBrad Ball - Citigroup: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference.\nDaniel T. Henry - EVP and CFO: So could I just - Tom, could I just - let me just make a few closing comments before we leave. So before I sign off, I'd like to say overall 2007 was another year of strong business and financial results. The benefits of our multiyear investment strategy continued to produce business metrics that are in the top tier of the industry.  It's clear that the economic environment this year will be more difficult. Fortunately, we have experience managing through different aspects of the business cycle, and we're facing this environment from a much stronger competitive position than in the past. As we did in 2002, our focus will be on working to prudently enhance our competitive position. This will entail a continued tight rein on our operating expenses, close management of credit risk, and careful management of our investment activities.  While we plan to invest somewhat less in our marketing and promotion activities in 2008 than in 2007, we still plan to spend at a healthy level. This level of spending should help us to position us to emerge from the downturn in a strong competitive position. It provides flexibility to react to further changes in the economic environment and to capitalize on opportunities in selected consumer segments, among small business, in international markets, and in the B2B sector. Thanks for joining us. I look forward to speaking to you again at the financial community meeting next week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn theconference over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nRon Stovall: Thank you and welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us fortoday's discussion.

In the third quarter 2007 earnings release and supplement,which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com and on file withthe SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that compares andreconciles the company's managed financial measures with GAAP financialinformation, and we explain why these presentations are useful to managementand to investors. We urge you to reviewthat information in conjunction with today's discussion.  Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief FinancialOfficer of American Express, will provide some introductory remarkshighlighting the key points relating to today's announcement.  Once he completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator,who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&Aperiod. Up until then, no one isactually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to asmany of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limitedamount of time. Based on this, we askthat you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan. \nDan Henry: Thanks, Ron and thanks, everyone for joining the calltoday. I'm very pleased to address theresults for this quarter. As Ron mentioned, I will make some introductoryremarks and then we will open up the line to take your questions.  As you've seen in the earnings documents, our third quarterresults were a continuation of the strong business momentum we have reportedthroughout recent years. They reflectthe benefit of our multi-year investments in a broad range of business-buildinginitiatives.  When we compare our results from continuing operations tothe third quarter of last year, net revenue grew 11%, income increased 15% anddiluted EPS of $0.90 rose 18%. Inaddition, ROE for the prior 12 months was 38%.  Significant items this quarter included: A $41 million after-tax charge related to the AmericanExpress International Deposit Company's investment portfolio, resulting fromthe previously announced sale of American Express Bank; and, A $75 million tax benefit, primarily related to theresolution of prior years' tax items. Last year's third quarter included a $24million after-tax gain on the sale of our card-related operations in Malaysiaand Indonesia.  In addition, both quarters included reengineering costswhich totaled approximately $7 million after-tax in each period.  During the quarter and year-to-date we returned 84% and 85%respectively of total capital generated to our shareholders through sharerepurchases and dividends. Since 1994,we have returned 70% of capital generated to shareholders, which is above our65% long-term target.  The 11% revenue growth in the quarter reflects strongdouble-digit increases in a number of revenue categories, including discountrevenue and card member lending finance revenue. As we discussed with you last quarter,overall revenue growth was suppressed somewhat by substantially higher interestexpense.  There is one other point I want to clarify related torevenue estimates that I pointed out last quarter but continues to be anissue. It generally appears thatbrokerage analysts' models detailing our revenues haven't adjusted to reflectour revised income statement presentation. However, within the various services that report the analyst estimates,there seems to be inconsistencies in the revenues reflected from variousanalysts. In most cases, revenuesreflected are net of interest expense as we report them; while in others,revenues before interest expense seem to be included.  Additionally, in some cases, revenue estimates are made on amanaged rather than a GAAP basis. Because of this, the consensus revenue figures reported by theseservices are not comparable to our reported GAAP revenues net of interestexpense. For those who want to comparethe company's revenues from a managed perspective, you need to add the U.S.Card Services GAAP-to-managed adjustment shown in our earnings tables andsupplements.  Now as previously communicated, we revised our segmentreporting this quarter to reflect the impact of our recent realignment of thecompany into consumer and business-to-business organizations and the agreementto sell American Express Bank to Standard Chartered. As a result of these events, the previouslyreported International Card and Global Commercial Services segment is nowreported as two separate segments: International Card Services and GlobalCommercial Services. In addition, theresults of American Express Bank have been removed from the corporate and othersegment and are now reported within the discontinued operations line.  So let me make a few observations related to the revisedreporting. As you have seen within ourprior disclosures, our overall international business growth has been strong,as the combination of our proprietary consumer, corporate services and globalnetwork services business have strengthened the company's position andpotential throughout the major regions around the globe.  I would like to note that the relatively slower card andvolume growth within international card services during recent quartersreflects the constrained level of investments during the past few years, inaddition to the negative impact of business sales in Brazil,Malaysia and Indonesia.  As you know from our prior disclosures, difficultindustry-wide credit conditions in certain markets and our own restructuringactivities reduced acquisition and loyalty-related investments outside the U.S. Recent quarters also reflect the more selective premiumcustomer strategy the international card services management team has beenfocused on. The benefits of thatstrategy shift are evident in the strong average card member spend growth andthe higher average fee per card reported in this quarter. These results, in addition to increasedinvestment levels, position us well for the future.  You'll note a tax credit in most quarters withininternational card services. This willlikely continue, as our internal tax allocation process reports within thissegment the consolidated tax benefit arising from its ongoing non-U.S. fundingactivities.  Lastly, you'll see that segment capital and return onsegment capital for international card services and global commercial servicesinclude the impact from the allocation of goodwill that previously residedwithin the old international card and global commercial services segment. Themajority of the goodwill was attributed to business travel acquisitions. Consistent with Generally Accepted AccountingPrinciples, that goodwill has been allocated to the two segments based on therelative fair value of these segments. Our segment capital allocation method includesa dollar-for-dollar allocation for our goodwill.  I note this because it is important for you to understandthat the return on tangible equity within the international card services and globalcommercial services segments are substantially higher than the reportedreturns, which include the impact of this goodwill.  Now as far as our consolidated results go, they were drivenby excellent growth in card member spend, loans and cards in-force. Billed business growth remains strong, andeach of our customer segments in every geographic region contributed to the 16%growth worldwide or 14% growth on an FX-adjusted basis.  Let me give you some more detail. In our U.S.proprietary business, consumer spending grew 12%; small business spending rose15%; and corporate services volumes improved by 9%. In total, U.S.volumes for retail and everyday spend grew 15%. This category represents about 68% of U.S.billings. Travel and entertainment-related spending, which accounts for theremainder, rose 10%.  Outsidethe U.S., proprietary billed businessgrew 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. Thiswas driven by 7% growth within our consumer and small business activity, and15% growth within corporate services. Within global network services, billed business rose 45%, driven bynearly 100% growth within the U.S.,as well as continued robust growth outside of the U.S. Worldwide cards in-force rose 11%. We added 2.5 million net new cards during thequarter and 8.2 million net new cards since last year. This reflects 6% growth versus last year inproprietary cards, and 32% growth in network partner cards. Spending per proprietary basic card grew 8%worldwide, even with the suppressing effect of substantial card additions overthe past few years. Our average discount rate of 2.57 was flat versus last yearand last quarter.  With strong growth in cards and a higher average fee percard, net card fee revenue increased 13% this quarter. Travel commissions and fees increased 13%,reflecting a 16% increase in travel sales.  Once again, we saw our strong growth in card member spendinggenerate a high level of loan growth. Worldwide lending balances on an owned basis rose 32%. On a managed basis, balances grew 23% on 24%growth in the U.S.and a 17% increase in our non-U.S. portfolios. This strong growth continues to reflect the flowthrough of particularlyattractive spending levels within our co-brands, lending on charge and othercredit card relationships. It alsoreflects our successful acquisition efforts surrounding these products.  Securitization income increased 2%, as higher gains fromissuances and a greater average balance on securitized loans offset higherwrite-offs and interest expense. Cardmember lending finance revenue rose 30% on growth in the owned portfolio. Interest expense increased 39%. This was due to a 40% increase in fundingcosts within the lending business and a 38% increase in the charge card and otherinterest expense lines. Much of thisreflects volume increases within the business but also higher market rates,which, as you know, rose during the third quarter as LIBOR-based rates andmarket spreads increased in reaction to the credit concerns that were pervasivethroughout the markets.  As we discussed with you last quarter, interest expense wasalso driven by the expiration of some fixed rate debt and hedges at the end oflast year. Specifically, fixed rateddebt and hedges within the UScard business declined by $11 billion. The effective funding rate on that amount was 3.2%. It was replaced by funding based on highermarket rates of approximately 5.4%. Thisresulted in about $59 million of incremental expense in the quarter versus lastyear, that was solely related to the debt and hedges that expired.  Marketing and promotion rewards and card member servicesexpense increased 14%, reflecting higher volumes related to rewards costs andgreater marketing and promotion expense. Our marketing efforts this quarter were somewhat more focused onspending outside the U.S.versus the U.S.-oriented investment activity during the second quarter. Increases in rewards costs continue toreflect strong spending growth, higher redemption rights and increased cardmember participation.  Human resource expense increased 11% due to merit increases,greater benefits costs and a higher number of employees, primarily resultingfrom customer service initiatives and acquisitions within corporate services.The growth in the remaining operating expenses reflect the impact of increasedvolumes within our technology and card member servicing activities. However, excluding the impact of last year'sgain on the sale of our Malaysian and Indonesian businesses, these expenseswere flat.  The total provision for loss and benefits increased 25% versuslast year, as the lending provision increased 41%, the charge provision rose 9%,and the other provision was 5% higher. The increase in lending provision wasdriven by higher loan volumes and increased past due and writeoff rates in the USportfolio relative to the lower year-ago levels that benefited from the impactof the 4Q05 bankruptcy legislation. Thecharge card provision rose 9%, reflecting growth in volumes and relativelystable credit indicators.  The consolidated tax rate of 24% for the quarter declinedversus the 29% rate last year, due to the $75 million of tax benefits Ireferenced earlier.  With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Weagain delivered strong revenue and earnings growth and excellent returns duringthe quarter, while continuing to invest in key business initiatives andmaintaining balance sheet strength.  Business metric performance, like growth in billed businessand loan balances, continued to be in the top tier of the industry. The gapbetween our growth rate and that of most major competitors demonstrates theeffectiveness and ongoing benefits of our marketing and rewards investmentsover the past several years.  Credit quality continues to compare favorably to theindustry. As expected, losses and past duelevels within the U.S.have trended higher, post the bankruptcy reform benefit of last year. However, credit quality indicators remain inline with historic ranges, as we continue to benefit from our focus on thepremium market sector and our rewards-oriented strategy.  Needless to say, in light of some signs of stress withinaspects of the environment and our strong receivable growth, we continue to becarefully monitoring the trends as we go forward.  While our bottom line results were strong during thequarter, as expected, we continued to be negatively impacted by near-terminterest rates and provision challenges discussed with you in priorquarters.  Within interest expense, we saw the effect of the items Imentioned earlier: the $11 billion reduction in our fixed rate debt and hedgeposition, higher volumes and generally higher market rates. The interestexpense level in the fourth quarter is obviously dependent on the credit marketenvironment. Credit spreads remain widerfor debt issuers across all rating classes. Our spreads did not widen as muchas comparably rated financial institutions in the third quarter, and have sincenarrowed along with the rest of the market.  For the remainder of 2007, if the more recent reductions inthe LIBOR benchmark rates persist but the wider credit spreads continue, webelieve our funding costs would not be materially different than what we sharedwith you last quarter.  As you know from our prior discussions, we have madeconsiderable efforts over recent years to implement flexible businessplans. These plans position us to pullback on spending when required by external economic factors or businessperformance. They also allow us toincrease spending if the environment permits.  As such, for the remainder of 2007 we continue to plan towork to target our marketing-related investments to further build upon ourcompetitive strengths at a point where some of our competitors may beexperiencing comparatively weaker business results. In addition to the flexibility measures, we remain focusedon reengineering to maximize our ability to invest in key growthopportunities. While reengineering willlikely generate some costs from period to period, it positions us to continueto effectively control underlying operating expense growth.  Despite some of the near-term interest and provisionpressures we see, we continue to have confidence in the outlook of our businessfor several reasons: our position within the affluent and high-spending cardmember sectors remain excellent; it is supported by our ability to leverage ourdirect merchant relationships, the unique information benefit of our closed loopnetwork and our attractive rewards program.  Given our business momentum and industry-leading results inrecent years, and our strong track record of innovation, product developmentand customer-focused marketing, we believe that we are well-positioned toexecute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues toappropriately balance our short, medium and long-term business and financialgoals.  Thank you for listening. We are now ready to take yourquestions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from Meredith Whitney - CIBC WorldMarkets.  \nMeredith Whitney -CIBC World Markets: Dan, could I just get you to rephrase your finalcomments? Were you saying that you'regoing to use the excess earnings or any upside in earnings to plow that backinto marketing -- I know I'm extrapolating here -- as opposed to buying backshares, because you feel the opportunities are so rich this quarter?  \nDan Henry: I think our outlook now is the same as it has been for anumber of years. We look to continue toinvest in the business momentum that we've achieved. We certainly balanced theamount that we're spending on marketing, so that we can balance our earningstargets, as well as to continue to invest appropriately to achieve the kind ofgrowth that we have over recent periods. So we're very focused on our billed business growth, as well as loangrowth and cards in-force. So we willcontinue to invest to maintain that business momentum.  \nMeredith Whitney -CIBC World Markets: So your summary is basically no new changes? \nDan Henry: Correct.  \nMeredith Whitney -CIBC World Markets: You guys again experienced receivable growth that none ofyour competitors experienced; not to mention the billed business growth. Isyour provisioning policy that you're just keeping up with the receivablesgrowth, which you're allowed to do? Canyou explain your provision policy, because obviously the market is freaked outsufficiently about some of the bank players who have increased their provisions,for different reasons?  \nDan Henry: So as we have discussed, we are focused on acquiringcustomers that have a high level of spend. We put products in the marketplace, both charge products and other lendingproducts, and we really allow the customer to choose which product they want touse, but focused on customers with high spend. As people spend on lendingproducts, there is a flowthrough effect of that high level of spending, whichis driving the increase in our loan balances.  Now, as it relates to our provisioning, we have used thesame model for provisioning for the last several years. It's focused on the experience that we seeand we used those models the same way this quarter as we have in pastquarters. So we continue to use the samemethodology. We think it's a methodologythat appropriately matches credit expense with the revenues that are beinggenerated and provides us with reserves that are appropriate, given thebehavior that we're seeing within our customers.  \nMeredith Whitney -CIBC World Markets: Finally, what are you seeing in terms of behavioral trendswith your high end consumer? Thanks so much. \nDan Henry: I think you can look at both our average spend numbers,which despite the fact that we continue to bring in a substantial number of newcards, continue to be very strong, continue to be well above thecompetition. I think that's a reflectionof the quality of customers we're bringing in, as well as the loyalty of thosecustomers, based on the value proposition that we offer to them. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Brendler \u2013 StifelNicholas. \nChris Brendler \u2013Stifel Nicholas : Are you seeing any signs of a slowdown, particularlydomestically? Last time I discussed thiswith you, it seemed like the small business sector would be a place where youmight see early warning signs of a slowdown, but 15% this quarter looks prettygood. Anything beneath the surface thatsuggests that you're seeing any sort of slowdown in the U.S.? \nDan Henry: As I mentioned, small business billed business grew by15%. That's the same level that we hadlast quarter. Quite frankly, theportfolio continues to perform very well and we are very pleased with it. So in the third quarter, as I said, 15%growth we view to be very positive.\nChris Brendler \u2013Stifel Nicholas : The discount rate continues to defy gravity a littlebit. You mentioned in the supplementthat you expect that to continue to trend down over time, but it's not trendingdown this year. Any color on the discount rate? Is that still a mix issue, or is it any sort of pricing initiatives thatyou have been able to put through?  \nDan Henry: Our discount rate is affected by the mix of spending. We have emphasized over the last few yearsspending in everyday spend categories. Some of those categories have lower discount rates than the average, soto the extent we continue to grow in that area, you'll see discount ratespotentially come down.  Also, as certain merchants increase their billings, there issome impact on our rate related to that.  Those two factors, in large measure in recent quarters havebeen offset by value recapture, where there are merchants where we can clearlydemonstrate the value that we are bringing to them and as a result, are able toactually increase the discount rate.  This quarter's rate is the same as last year or last quarter,but what happens in the future will depend on the mix of those items and that'swhat will drive the discount rate. Itcould well be that in the future there is a drop in discount rate. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Posner - Morgan Stanley.\nKen Posner - MorganStanley : Good afternoon. American Express is clearly generating veryimpressive revenue growth from its lending strategy. With the credit delinquencies starting tomarch up as has been long expected, and with economists in the U.S. calling fora little bit of a slowdown, are you guys taking steps now to tightenunderwriting standards and dial back on the growth? Or, are you planning to keep growing, so thatthe denominator keeps the credit loss ratio from getting too high?  \nDan Henry: I think it's important to view our results in the context ofthe industry, which everybody is aware of. We've been able to balance strong business growth, along with creditindicators which continue to be favorable to the industry.  Certainly, if you look at some of our competitors, whiletheir growth in spending and their portfolios have been significantly slowerthan ours,, some have been able to control credit well and some have not. As we all know, credit risk is inherent inour business. Our main focus is to ensure that we are making good economicdecisions that really maximize the portfolio, as opposed to being focused onsimply keeping writeoff rates at a low level. That has always been our outlook and will continue to be our outlook.  As we've discussed numerous times, we think we have builtvery strong credit capabilities, and those capabilities will monitor veryclosely what is taking place within the portfolio. We will react appropriately to any changes inthe credit environment. \nKen Posner - MorganStanley : Could I take that to mean then that there are no plansunderway at this moment, or no steps being taking right now to tightenunderwriting or dial back on that growth rate?  \nDan Henry: I think we continue to want to focus on the premiumsector. As you've seen from the chartsthat we showed at the financial community meeting in August, the make-up of ourportfolio this year is exactly the same as it was last year, and the make-up ofthat portfolio is certainly focused on the prime and super-prime. We haven'tchanged that focus; we will continue to have that focus.  Again, our immediate reaction to what is taking place in themarketplace isn't to constrain spending of our customers. We do that on a customer-by-customer basisand as long as customers continue to behave appropriately, we will continue tohave them spend, which is very much in line with our business model. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hochstim - Bear Stearns.\nDavid Hochstim - BearStearns : Could you talk a little bit more about the growth in cardsin the quarter and the change in average spending per card member? Just lookingat the sequential changes there, is there an effect on the timing of theincrease in cards on average spending per card member?  Could you give us a sense of what kind of shift there hasbeen in the last quarter or two on different relationships? Costco, forexample, or Delta? Are those stillcontributing meaningfully to growth in spending as well as cards, or not somuch?  \nDan Henry: Our cards in-force growth this quarter was strong. It actually is pretty consistent with what wehave seen over the last several quarters. \nDavid Hochstim - BearStearns : It was a little better, actually.  \nDan Henry: A little better, but consistent. That's a reflection of where we're puttingour investments. We are very focused oncontinuing to bring new card members into the franchise. Once we have them intothe franchise, to build their loyalty over time, to ensure that we offer themthe right product at entry but also, as they evolve as customers, to modifywhat product they may have so that we continue to meet their needs. I thinkthat is part of the average spend story as well, and we continue to be veryfocused on having the right loyalty programs in place to drive that higherlevel of spending.  Quite frankly, I think we're also benefiting in terms ofaverage spend and overall spend, by the fact that the affluent sector isperforming very well, and that is really our sweet spot. So I think both how we're investing, what ourcustomer base is and our focus on loyalty programs are all contributing to thehigh level of spend and the improvement in average spend per card member. \nDavid Hochstim - BearStearns : Is there any change in the relative mix of things likeCostco and Delta, in terms of new cards and spending, or the other toprelationships?  \nDan Henry: I think our co-brand partners continue to be a veryimportant part of our franchise. We'reseeing an appropriate amount of growth in both cards and spend from thoseco-brand partners. I would say that wehave had a very good relationship with them which has been beneficial to bothour customers -- to them and to us -- and that is continuing. \nDavid Hochstim - BearStearns : Can you give us a sense of how different funding costs wereon secured and unsecured financings in the second half of the third quarterversus the second quarter? I was alittle unclear on what you were seeing.  \nDan Henry: As you think about it, we really broke this into two pieces. One, we were comparing the $11 billion offixed rate funding we had last year. When those hedges and fixed rate debt rolled off, they had a rate ofabout 3.2%. When we had to refund theaverage cost of that was about 5.4%. Wehave higher expense in the quarter this quarter compared to last quarter, justas a result of that, of $59 million.  If you look at the rest of the portfolio, I think thefunding costs in the third quarter are slightly higher than in the secondquarter because there was a run-up in interest rates last year. I guess thegoal in the second quarter this year was higher for us, because interest rateswere lower in the second quarter of \u201806 than they were in the third quarter of\u201806. I think funding costs for us fromthe second quarter to the third quarter are relatively comparable and we think,assuming the environment doesn't change, would be similar in the fourth quarterto the third quarter. \nDavid Hochstim - BearStearns : So saying basically that you weren't affected by the spreadwidening? \nDan Henry: I think there are multiple things going on in themarketplace. We had LIBOR jump up. We had the spreads widen. On the other hand, Fed funds were moving down,even though that's what we collect from our customers. But when you put it in the mix of all theevents that happened in the marketplace, we would think we would wind up inabout the same place from a rate basis in the fourth quarter as compared towhat we were in the third quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Dan, you mentioned a lot of the marketing dollars were spentinternationally. What were the regionswhere most of those were spent?  \nDan Henry: I think we spent broadly across many regions, including Australiaand India. We mixed it up with both some of our larger,more mature markets as well as some of the markets that are smaller andemerging. We focused most of the dollars on acquisition, as we are looking tobring in more card members to the franchise. I would say it was prettybroad-based and heavily focused on the acquisition side. It also continues to support the strategy ininternational that I referred to, where there we are focusing on the premiumsector. \nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: If we were to think about the next couple of years and wherethe growth would come from, what regions would the growth in that segment comefrom?  \nDan Henry: So I don't think we do forecasting, although I think we willcontinue to focus on our major markets, which make a strong contribution. We would be looking to selectively decidewhich other markets are important that we invest in. Effectively, it will bedriven in large measure by both strategy as well as by using our investmentoptimization process, where we look at which investments will give us thegreatest long-term return. So acombination of those two things, I think, will dictate year by year and overthe longer term where our investments go. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : Thank you. I was also focused on the internationalopportunity and any change in your viewpoint, given you've had a verysubstantial run-up or increase in marketing in the international segment. You're starting to see an acceleration ofcard growth. You had talked about under-investinginternationally. I would like a little more color. Your marketing is up 50% year over year; 43%internationally and up $60 million quarter over quarter.  \nDan Henry: As I said, because of just general industry issues, therewere credit issues internationally. The fact that we were doing somerestructuring, if you look back over the last couple of years, our investmentlevels were constrained. We think theinternational markets represent a significant opportunity to us and so wewanted to increase those investment levels.  Now, when you saw us increase investment levels in marketingin the second quarter, it primarily came within the U.S.business because when we realized we had the opportunity, there was morereadiness in the U.S.to spend within the second quarter. Soas we moved to the third quarter, we wanted to balance that out so that we wereincreasing our investments in both the U.S.and the international markets, and therefore you saw that in the U.S.segment in the third quarter growth wasn't as robust, but we increasedmarketing in the third quarter.  So if you look at the two quarters together, it really showsan increase in marketing dollars across all regions of the globe. \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : You also talked about the tax credit that you had, youexpect to continue? \nDan Henry: Yes. \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : What kind of a tax rate are you looking at next quarter andthe next couple of quarters, so I can understand what that is? \nDan Henry: In this quarter within the international card services,there was partial sharing of the $75 million; there was about $17 million inthere. But even excluding that, therewas a credit for that segment. I thinkthat will continue, and it's really based on the way we do our internal taxallocation within the group. We realizedsome benefits that are in high tax rate environments that we allocate to theinternational segment. But a large portion of their taxable income is actuallyin lower tax rate environments, and we permanently reinvest the dollarsthere. So on that, there's a very lowtax rate. We don't expect that tochange, so we would continue to see that tax benefit as we move forward.  \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : What is the global or the corporate tax rate, then?  \nDan Henry: This quarter, our global tax rate was 24% this quarter,compared to 29% in the quarter last year. \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : What is it ongoing?  \nDan Henry: The 24% is largely driven by the $75 million tax benefitthat we received, related to prior periods. I think we've talked about this on other occasions. If you think about our tax rate, absent any itemsrelated to prior periods, we will probably be around that 30%, 31% range.That's on a consolidated basis, but the amount that we're allocating to theinternational card services group, for the reasons I just cited, it's likelythat they will continue to actually have a tax benefit, even when they have pre-taxincome.  \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : On the hedges, Dan, is that the last big significant amount,the $11 billion, to run off? The $11billion of funding where the hedges ran off this quarter that cost you $59million. You said that fourth quarter cost of funds should be similar to thethird quarter. So is that the lastsignificant amount?  \nDan Henry: The $11 billion ended last year. So every quarter this year will have animpact. So related to that, next quarter, the fourth quarter will be negativelyimpacted for a similar amount when you compare it to last year.  \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : But there are no additional hedges that are running off? \nDan Henry: No significant hedges that are running off, no.  \nBob Napoli - PiperJaffray : Last question, one of your competitors had said that theyhad seen an uptick in delinquencies and credit issues in areas that haveexperienced high home price appreciation like Californiaand Florida, for example. Are you not seeing that same kind of a thing? \nDan Henry: As you can see from our credit metrics, they have ticked upslightly, but very much in line with what we expected coming off very low rateslast year. At the current time, the creditquality of our portfolio continues to be the same. I think we benefit from thefact that we are focused on the prime and super-prime areas so we have notdirectly seen an impact from sub-prime activity at the current time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Ball - Citi.\nBrad Ball - Citi : A question about the GNS business. You have been ramping the growth theresignificantly. Is there any particularrelationship or product that has really been behind that growth? Can you talk about any prospects foradditions on the GNS side?  \nDan Henry: Our GNS business continues to be very strong. We had growth in the U.S.of almost 100%. Growth outside the U.S.continues to be very robust. I think weare seeing positive results across a broad spectrum of products that we areissuing, as well as a broad section of our partners. We continue to be very pleased with the GNSgrowth and the way that it fits into our overall strategy, both in the U.S.and internationally.  When you really put together internationally a combinationof our proprietary business and the GNS business, we are very pleased with theposition we are in. \nBrad Ball - Citi : You said in your prepared remarks that there was an impactin the year-ago quarter from lower bankruptcies. We are still seeing bankruptcy levels runninga bit below normal. Are you still seeing some benefit from that? How long do you expect that to play out?  \nDan Henry: I think if you look at industry statistics, they havegradually been rising over the past year or so. In recent time, probablyticking up a little bit faster. I think we'll keep our eye on that. But when you look at the bankruptcies inrelation to our other writeoffs, they are in line with what our expectationswere and reflect the fact that we're coming off very low levels in \u201806. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom - UBS. \nEric Wasserstrom -UBS : I am just trying to reconcile two distinct trends. On the one hand, in terms of your payoutratios, you talk about how you continue to be far above the standard thatyou've set for yourself over time, which in some ways seems to question theappropriateness of that standard, given where your ROE is. I wonder why that target isn't discussed? The only reason I could think of would be if there was someconcern about credit trends. But on theother hand, of course, the message is that the credit trends, though risingmoderately, are very well contained.  Can you help me understand that interplay between creditpressures and capital allocation?  \nDan Henry: I don't think what we are returning to shareholders in termsof dividends or share buybacks has anything to do with concerns about credit.We've been at levels above 55% for quite a while now. I think we like to keep the flexibility thatwe have in terms of returning capital to shareholders by having a lot of itcome through share repurchases. Itenables us, if sometime in the future we were going to do some supportingacquisitions, that we would have a way of funding that using the capital that isgenerated from our business quarter to quarter. That's really the driving force behind keeping the dividend level atwhere is today, or somewhere near that.  As you know, we periodically have increased it over time,but having the flexibility to either absorb bumps in the road or to beavailable for acquisitions is the reason that we have our current policy. We'll largely continue that in the future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Sproule - Thomas WeiselPartners. \nMark Sproule - ThomasWeisel Partners: On managed receivable growth, can you talk a little bitabout the investment there and where you see opportunities distinctly, givensome of the pressures that your competitors have noted? How do you balance thedesire to build the portfolio with the market pressures of the currentenvironment?  \nDan Henry: As we say often, we have a spend-centric focus. It is not our objective to build the loanbalances. It is our objective to bringon card members who have higher than average spend. We allow those customers, really, to pick theproduct that best suits them; so that could be a charge card, it could be aco-branded card, it could be lending on charge, it could be a Blue card. As long as, on average, we're bringing incustomers that have higher average spend, that really meets our business modelof being focused on spend.  Now what we're getting is really a flowthrough of thathigher spend on our lending products, which is what's growing our loan balances. So we don't have a loan balance growth target,it is really driven by our spend. We continue to be focused on the behavior ofour customers. We think we haveexcellent, best in class credit capabilities. They are at all times focused on the behaviors of our customers. Giventhe environment today, are even more so. I think loan growth is coming from really strong billedbusiness growth that we are seeing at the end of the day. I think we're comfortable with where we arebased on our focus on investing and allowing spending that will have an economicgain for us over time. \nMark Sproule - ThomasWeisel Partners : I think you had mentioned earlier the bifurcation betweeninternational spending and domestic spending. As you look into Q4 and beyond, should we see some of that revert backto being maybe a little bit more evenly divided between the two, as you try toacquire more customers domestically?  \nDan Henry: Well, I think our spending growth, if you're going to splitit between U.S.and outside the U.S.,in part will be driven by our investment dollars. So if we are tending to invest a little bitmore on one section than the other, you would expect to see somewhat strongergrowth there. Now, it's not spending that comes five days or even a quarterafter we bring on customers; it builds over time.  I think where we're doing our investing has an influence, aswell as the economy also has an influence. We have been pleased with theinvestments we have been making. I thinkwe've had very good returns.  Going back a little bit to the question on how do we feelabout our AR growth, our AR growth is significantly higher than ourcompetitors', but our billed business growth is also significantly higher thanour competitors\u2019. So you have to link those two together, and that strongerbilled business growth is what is driving the higher AR growth.  We will continue to invest both in the U.S.and internationally. What the growthrates will be will be dependent on our investments and the economies within therespective regions. \nMark Sproule - ThomasWeisel Partners :  If I could sneak one last one in quickly. I understand thecredit markets, or your credit stability, has been much stronger than yourcompetition. When you look in yourportfolio and you're assessing issues that might be problematic, what are youdoing to proactively stay ahead of what might be consumer issues across thecountry, whether it's regionally or group specific?  \nDan Henry: On the charge card side, every charge is something that isapproved as the charge goes through. We are very focused on our lendingcustomers. If we see good behaviors, weincrease their lines. If theindividuals' behaviors are not, we actively manage those lines down.  I think we also benefit from a wide amount of diversitywithin the portfolio, based on the products that we offer and the co-brandpartners that we have. So it is something that we are diligent about all thetime. We are constantly investing in improvingour capabilities and seeing what information we can use to help improve ourassessment of a customer's credit worthiness, and therefore what we allow themto spend.  So it is an ongoing mission of ours to have capabilitiesthat will help to drive our business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Posner - Morgan Stanley. \nKen Posner - MorganStanley : I wanted to ask a question about the discount rate, which asan earlier questioner had pointed out, has remained stable year over year. Can you address the incentives and cashbacksthat are netted out in that calculation? Have those changed as a proportion of the total, or are those flat yearover year as well?  \nDan Henry: As it relates to cashbacks, which are reflected in thediscount revenue line, our cashback product continues to perform verywell. That is increasing within thatline. As we deal with commercial clients,that is also something that gets netted on that line, and we continue to havestrong growth in that business as well.  Discount revenue is growing, and those are elements thatactually slow that growth down. When youare doing comparisons from billed business to discount revenue, those are someof the elements that come into play there. \nKen Posner - MorganStanley : Forgive me, because I've misplaced which page has thefootnote that refers to the items that are netted out of that calculation. What is the effect of incentives and otherkinds of things that are netted out of the discount rate calculation? Are they increasing or decreasing?  \nDan Henry: I don't think they are having a material effect on thediscount rate. The thing that has amajor effect on the discount rate is really the mix of business that we'reseeing by type of merchant; that has an impact. The volumes at specific merchants have an impact. Those would have animpact in terms of driving the rate down.  The major thing that's having an impact in improving therate is really value recapture where we are dealing with merchants where we canclearly demonstrate that we are bringing value to them and that it's warrantedthat we have a higher rate. Those arethe three key elements that are driving the discount rate. \nOperator: Your final question comes from James Fotheringham - GoldmanSachs. \nJames Fotheringham -Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Just with respect to growth opportunities, canyou talk about what you see as the greatest opportunities to grow the network?What is the best way to realize these opportunities with respect to organicversus strategic initiatives? Thanks. \nDan Henry: I think our network is going to grow in two ways. The network is going to grow just based on thegrowth in our proprietary business. Aswe've said, we think we have great opportunities both in the consumer sector,in middle market, within small business. We think there is an abundant amount of growth as customers andbusinesses will continue to use credit cards more and more into thefuture. So I think as we grow theproprietary business, that will strengthen the network.  GNS will also have a very positive effect on the network aswe bring more cards onto the network, more spending onto the network. How we utilize independent operators alsowill benefit the network in terms of allowing our customers to use their cardin more places.  Really, all elements of our business will help to improvethe network, strengthen it and help us to continue to gain share as we haveover the last several years. \nJames Fotheringham -Goldman Sachs : With respect to debit, do you see that as an opportunity forgrowth? Or is that not in theconsideration that you just outlined?  \nDan Henry: Debit is something that we've talked about many times. It's hard to have a large debit programwithout demand deposits. There arecertainly a number of things we can think about doing, but when we look atthose opportunities compared to the investment opportunities that we have inour core business, we have so many opportunities in our core business, that'swhere we will continue to invest. \nJames Fotheringham -Goldman Sachs : Thank you very much.\nDan Henry: Thanks, everybody for participating in the call today. Just before we get off, I wanted to mentionthat we will be filing an 8-K within the next couple of weeks, which willactually provide restatements back through 2005. You should be on the lookout for that. That willprovide you with some additional historical information on a restatedbasis.  Thank you, everyone for joining the call.

(Operator Instructions) Mr. Stovall, you may begin your conference. \nRon Stovall : Thank you, Joanne. Welcome, we appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. As usual, it's my job to remind everyone that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, planning, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company's 2006 10-K report, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the second quarter 2007 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our web site at ir.AmericanExpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that compares and reconciles the company's managed base financial measures with the GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.  Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Acting Chief Financial Officer of American Express will provide some introductory remarks highlighting the key points related to today's announcement. Once he completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions.  While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan. \nDan Henry: Thanks, Ron and thanks, everyone for joining the call today. I'm very pleased to address the results for this quarter. As Ron mentioned, and consistent with our usual process, I will make introductory remarks, and then we will open the lines and take your questions. As you've seen in the earnings document, our second quarter continued the strong business momentum we recorded throughout 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. It reflects the benefits of our multi-year investments in a broad range of business-building initiatives.  When you compare our results from continuing operations to the second quarter of last year, net revenues grew 9%, income also increased 9%, and diluted EPS of $0.88 rose 13%. In addition, ROE for the prior 12 months rose 38%.  Significant items this quarter include a $65 million tax benefit from the IRS related to the treatment of prior years' card fee income. In light of this benefit, we increased marketing and promotion spending by $68 million, or $42 million after tax, above the level planned for the quarter. Last year's second quarter included a $144 million, or $131 million after-tax gain related to the sale of our card and merchant-related operations in Brazil, and a $62 million, or $40 million after-tax charge, associated with Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S.  In addition, both quarters include re-engineering costs, which totaled $8 million or $5 million after tax this year; versus $53 million, or $43 million after tax last year. During the quarter and year-to-date, we returned 81% and 85%, respectively of total capital generated to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Since 1994, we have returned 90% of capital generated to our shareholders, which is above our 65% long-term target.  The 9% revenue growth in the quarter reflects strong increases in discount revenue and card member lending finance revenue. However, overall revenue growth was suppressed by the negative impact within securitization income of higher credit losses following last year's unusually low level, and substantially higher interest expense, as we discussed with you last quarter.  One other point of clarification related to revenues. It generally appears that analyst models detailing our revenues have been adjusted to reflect our revised income statement presentation. However, within the various services that report the analyst estimates, there seems to be inconsistencies in the revenues reflected for various analysts. In some cases, revenues reflected are net of interest expense as we report them, while in others, revenues before interest expense are included. Therefore, the consensus revenue figure reported by these services does not appear to be comparable to our reported revenues net of interest expense.  As far as our results go, they were driven by excellent growth in cardmember spending, loans and cards-in-force. Billed business growth remained strong. Each of our customer segments and every geographic region contributed to the 15% growth worldwide, or 13% growth on an FX adjusted basis.  So, let me give you some more detail. In our U.S. proprietary business, consumer spending grew 12%, small business spending rose 15%, and corporate services volumes improved by 10%. In total, U.S. volumes for retail and everyday spending grew 15%. This category represents about 68% of U.S. billings. Travel and entertainment-related spending, which accounts for the remainder, rose 9%.  Outside the U.S., proprietary billed business grew 5% on an FX adjusted basis. This was driven by 3% growth within our consumer and small-business activity, and 10% growth within corporate services. As you know, these proprietary card comparisons outside the U.S. are negatively affected by last year's sale and transfer to three bank partners of our Brazilian operations as of June 30th, and our Malaysian and Indonesian activities during the third quarter of '06. Excluding the impact of these sales, the spending on proprietary cards rose 10% outside the U.S. on an FX-adjusted basis.  Within Global Network Services, billed business rose 62%, driven by continued triple-digit growth within the U.S., as well as robust growth outside the U.S. Excluding the impact of the businesses transferred I just mentioned, GNS billed business growth was 41%.  For those interested in learning more about our GNS business, I want to remind you that at our financial community meeting on August 1st we will feature a presentation by Peter Godfrey, the President of GNS.  Worldwide cards-in-force rose 10%. We added 2.3 million net new cards during the quarter and 7.8 net new cards since last year. This reflects 5% growth versus last year in proprietary cards, and 34% growth in network partner cards. Spending per proprietary basic card grew 8% worldwide, even with the suppressing effect of the substantial card additions over the past few years.  Despite strong growth in cards and higher average fee per card of $36 this year versus $34 last year, our net card fee revenue decreased 6% this quarter. Consistent with the last three quarters, this reflects the reclassification of certain card acquisition-related costs, which are now reported as contra-revenue within this line. Prior to the third quarter of last year, these costs have been included in operating expense. This reclassification suppressed the consolidated revenue growth rate by approximately 1%, but had no effect on net income and is not included in the average fee per card calculation.  Our average discount rate was flat versus last year at 2.57% and consistent with seasonal mix of spend trends, declined 1 basis point versus last quarter. Travel commissions and fees increased 2%, reflecting a 9% increase in travel sales. Worldwide lending balances on a owned basis rose 33%. On a managed basis, balances grew 21% on 32% growth in the U.S. and 15% increase in our non-U.S. portfolios. This strong growth continues to reflect the attractive spending levels within our co-brand and other lending portfolios, and also reflects our successful acquisition efforts around these products.  Securitization income declined 11%, primarily due to the increase in write-offs versus last year's unusually low levels. Cardmember lending finance revenue rose 38% on growth in our own portfolio and a higher gross portfolio yield. Other interest income increased 41%, primarily due to the recognition of interest associated with the company's loan to Delta Air Lines.  Interest cost increased 44%. This was due to a 56% increase in funding costs within the lending business, a 35% increase within the charge and other line, and 45% higher international banking expense. Much of this reflects volume increases in the business and higher market rates. However, as we discussed with you last quarter, interest expense was also driven by the expiration of some fixed-rate debt and hedges at year end.  Specifically, fixed-rate debt and hedges within the U.S. card operation declined by $11 billion. The effective funding rate on that amount was 3.2%. It was replaced with funding based on short-term rates of approximately 5.3%. Consistent with the first quarter, this resulted in about $60 million of incremental expense versus last year in the quarter that was solely related to the debt and hedges that expired.  The marketing promotions, rewards and cardmember services line increased 9%, including last year's $62 million charge related to higher redemption rate estimates within our Membership Rewards reserve model outside the U.S. Excluding this, marketing and rewards costs increased approximately 14%. Increases in rewards costs continued to reflect our strong spending growth, higher redemption rates, and increasing cardmember participation.  Within marketing and promotion, we continued to be selective and generally maintained the reduced spending we talked about last quarter within various product-specific advertising, creative development and market research initiatives. However, we did increase expenditures related to various acquisition, brand and loyalty-oriented programs in light of the tax benefit realized in this quarter.  Here we were able to exercise our flexibility to invest an additional $68 million in marketing programs, although it is worth noting that even without the additional investments, our marketing expense would still have been significantly higher versus the first quarter, based on the strength of our business.  Human resource expense increased 4% as merit increases and greater benefit and incentive costs and a higher number of employees was partially offset by lower severance costs this year. Growth in the remaining operating costs reflects the impact of increased volumes within our technology and cardmember services activity. However, excluding the impact of last year's Brazilian gain and the re-class of card acquisition-related costs effective July 1, 2006, these costs only rose 3%.  The total provision for loss and benefits increased 36% versus last year. As the lending provision increased by 57%, the charge provision rose 21% and the international banking and other provision declined by 8%. The increase in lending provision was driven by higher loan volumes and increased past-due and write-off rates relative to the lower year-ago levels that benefited from the impact of the 4Q05 U.S. bankruptcy legislation.  The charge card provision rose 21%, reflecting growth in volume and somewhat higher loss rates. The decline in international banking and other provision was primarily due to lower certificate provisions and a reduction in the merchant-related reserves this year. The consolidated tax rate of 26% for the quarter declined versus the 33% rate last year, primarily due to the cards fee related benefit mentioned earlier.  With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We again delivered strong revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, while continuing to invest in key business initiatives and maintaining substantial balance sheet strength. Business metric performance, like growth in billed business and loan balances, continued to be in the top tier of the industry. The gap between our growth rate and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefits of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years.  Additionally, credit quality continued to be very strong. As expected, losses have trended upward post the U.S. bankruptcy reform benefit last year. However, credit quality remained well-controlled during the quarter as we continued to see the positive impact of our historic focus on the premium sector and our rewards capabilities through top tier write-offs and past due levels.  While the bottom line results were strong during the quarter, as expected, we continued to be negatively impacted by the near-term interest expense and provision grow over challenges we discussed last quarter. Within interest expense, we saw the effect of the items I mentioned earlier: the $11 billion reduction in our fixed rate debt and hedge position, higher volumes, and the generally higher market rates. Our interest rate expense level for the remainder of the year is obviously dependent on any further market fluctuations.  However, assuming rates remain at current levels, the incremental interest expense over the next two quarters related to the funding that replaced the $11 billion of fixed-rate debt and hedges will be approximately $130 million. Within the unhedged portion of our portfolio, assuming rates remain constant, we do not expect to have as unfavorable an impact during the remainder of 2007, since short-term market rates today are generally in line with where they were in the second half of last year.  In addition, the beneficial provision impacts from the U.S. bankruptcy law change that we enjoyed last year, and the resulting grow over challenge this year, will be lower in the second half of 2007. As you know from prior discussions, we made considerable efforts over recent years to implement flexibility of business plans. These plans position us to pull back on spending when required by external economic factors for business performance. They also allow us to increase spending if the environment permits. This quarter you again have seen the impact of our flexibility plans, which focus on more discretionary items, with operating expense first and secondarily within our marketing expense base. Overall expenses in the quarter were very well controlled.  In the first quarter, we discussed the fact that we would have invested more in marketing and promotion activity if we had had perfect foresight into the strength of our results during the latter part of that quarter. This quarter we became confident in our ability to realize the IRS benefit early enough to take advantage of some additional investment opportunities, although we were not able to spend the full $65 million after-tax benefit.  While we continue to hold back spending within some of the less growth-oriented investment areas we identified in the first quarter, we approved additional investments for various card acquisition, brand and loyalty-related initiatives. For the remainder of 2007 we plan to continue to work to maximize our marketing-related investments to further build upon our competitive strengths at a point where some of our competitors may be experiencing comparatively weaker business results.  In addition to our flexibility measures, we also remain focused on re-engineering to maximize our ability to invest in key growth opportunities. While re-engineering will likely generate some costs from period to period, it positions us to continue to effectively control underlying operating expense growth.  We also look to continue to leverage our investment optimization and re-engineering disciplines to allocate our resources to initiatives that will provide the greatest returns on our investments. This tactic, combined with the benefits of prior-year investments and strong top-line growth, we believe, will help to continue to support our business momentum while controlling expenses thoughtfully.  Despite some near-term interest and provision pressures we see, we continue to have confidence in the outlook of our business for several reasons: our position within the affluent and high-spending cardmember sector remains excellent. It is supported by our ability to leverage our direct merchant relationships, the unique information benefit of our closed-loop network, and our attractive rewards programs. All of these enable us to deliver premium differentiated offerings to our customers, while driving incremental spending to our merchants.  We believe these advantages and our position within the marketplace are not easily replicated by our competitors. We are also very optimistic about the broad growth opportunities within the payments industry. We have spoken to you in the past about plastic penetration upside that we see, given the relatively low level of spending currently on plastic throughout the geographies and customer segments in which we operate. In particular, we have highlighted opportunities within our consumer, small business, middle market and GNS businesses.  Given our recent business success and our strong track record of innovation, product development and customer-focused marketing, we believe that we are well-positioned to execute against these growth opportunities in a manner that appropriately balances our short, medium and long-term business and financial goals.  Thanks for listening. We are now ready to take your questions. \nOperator: Your first question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Thank you, good afternoon. I thought overall it was a pretty solid quarter. The one thing, though, that does continue to raise my eyebrows, if you will, is the growth in the lending balances. My concerns with that, with regards to potential credit risk are frequently, when you've seen somebody grow way above the industry, and you guys are taking, I think, the lion's share of the growth in the industry right now, you sometimes see credit blip up. But if you look at credit on a lagged basis, it's moving up there; it's still not at alarming levels, but it has moved up a little bit more on a lagged basis than we would like to see.  So I'd just like a little bit more explanation maybe on your part for why you think you're able to grow so much above? Because American Express historically has taken some market share, but not at this pace. So what's different? Secondarily, why are you so comfortable with credit, with that growth? Thank you. \nDan Henry: Thanks, Bob. You're right; we are growing our lending balances significantly faster than our major competitors. But we are also far outpacing our major competitors in terms of billed business. As you know, our focus is really on spend and not on growing balances. So, as we've discussed on a number of occasions, our spending is growing at a very robust rate of 15%, but our lending products within that number is actually growing at a faster rate. So the growth in our loans is commensurate with the growth in our spending on lending products.  It also is a fact, as we've indicated, that we've been focused on acquiring cards-in-force that are lending products. We're very comfortable doing that because we're focusing on acquiring customers on lending products that will have higher spend and that's our main focus.  In terms of credit, you can see from our credit statistics that while they have moved up from last year because of very low levels last year, we're still very comfortable where our credit metrics are showing. We have not in any way changed the criteria that we set in terms of bringing customers onto our books, and so we're not seeing any change in terms of the quality of customers that are in our franchise.  So overall, we're very pleased with both the growth in spending, the growth in the AR balances, and the quality of the customers that we have. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities. \n Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities: My question is around the additional marketing spend in the quarter. You said that you used the opportunity provided by the IRS gain to increase marketing. I was wondering if you can talk about where you targeted some of that spending, what parts of the market you're seeing opportunity in? For instance, in Capital One's call, they talked about basically a lack of opportunity in the upper end of the market and we're focusing again more down market. So I was wondering if you can clarify that a little bit. Thank you. \nDan Henry: We tried to continue the same focus we had in the first quarter in terms of pulling back on marketing that was more product, brand focused, or was research in nature. We wanted to concentrate the dollars that we had on acquisition, brand and loyalty, because those are the ones that have a more direct impact on near-term metrics. We did that in the first quarter, we continued that in the second quarter. We don't see any shortage of opportunity to invest in the business.  As we've talked about, we have an investment optimization process where we rank all of our investments. So if at any point we had to pull back on investments, we know which ones we'd pull back on. If we have the opportunity to spend more money, we know exactly what the next ones will be that we will invest. There's actually a long list of investment opportunities we have that are not funded that have very attractive returns.  So we see great opportunity, both in the consumer, small business, middle market and GNS. So, when we have the opportunity to spend, we know where we want to spend and we think that they will give us returns that are very favorable from a shareholder perspective. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus. \n Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus: I just wondered if you could give us a little more color around rewards. Specifically, I think, the last several quarters in a row you have highlighted higher redemption rates. At the February investor day you highlighted some new programs you had around increasing redemption, making it easier for Cardmembers to redeem their points. Can you talk at all about how you feel about your current models and where you're seeing redemption rates? Is this going to continue to be an increasing line, and is it within your expectations as it's gone so far this past year? \nDan Henry: Our rewards programs, particularly Membership Rewards, we think is really an excellent program. It's superior to many of the programs that are in the marketplace. We continue to enhance the program by adding new redemption options. Recently we created tiers within the Membership Rewards program so that each tier is specifically targeted to the Cardmembers who can participate in that tier.  Part of it, as you said, is either making it easier for people to redeem, or bringing value propositions to the programs that they value. We actually view it very positively when people redeem, because it means that they're engaged, and engagement is a very good thing as you look out in terms of what our performance will be over time.  So we continue to enhance the program. We look to continue to innovate and to increase the value proposition. If redemption rates increase as a result of that, we view that as a positive thing. Because overall, we think, the economics are very positive in terms of the spend as well as the credit behavior that we see in customers who are very active. The increases that we're seeing within the redemption rate are very much within our expectations in terms of what we've been planning for. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hochstim - Bear Stearns. \n David Hochstim - Bear Stearns: I wonder if you maybe could speak a little bit more about that in terms of the average cost per dollar of rewards. Has that moved up? As you create or increase engagement, as you put it, does that mean that we're headed for some other reevaluation of the liability on the balance sheet in the U.S. or outside the U.S.? \nDan Henry: I don't think that we have disclosed historically the average cost. I would say that we're very pleased with where average cost is today compared to where it's been historically. Some of the offerings that we add to the program may be at the higher end of the cost, and others balance that out by being at the lower end of the cost. The important part is to have options that our customers want.  So overall, we're very pleased with where average cost is and how it's been trending. The fact that it increases engagement is very positive. There's no indication, based on the comments I've made, that we're going to see an adjustment to the redemption rate, although as activity is processed, that's what drives where the redemption rate estimates are. We are constantly looking at our redemption rate methodology and seeing if new information provides us better insights, then we'll integrate that into the model as is appropriate. That's generally driven by the behavior of the customers and how the program has evolved over time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Meredith Whitney - CIBC World Markets. \n Meredith Whitney - CIBC World Markets: I need some extra help here, please. On page 7 of the earnings supplement, when you talk about the securitization income, if you could dumb that down for me, I would appreciate it. Because I appreciate the year-on-year decline in securitization income because of relative write-offs, but there was a pretty dramatic sequential decline. What does that mean in terms of how we look forward? In terms of the credit quality looks stellar, but then the securitization line has me a bit confused. So could you help me with that, please? \nDan Henry: If we look at the owned assets and you look at provision expense, you see a notable increase in provision, as we expected, because last year's levels were very low. When you look at securitization income, within there you have both the revenue that is being earned on those receivables as well as the cost of carry. But also, the credit losses related to those receivables are netted within securitization income. So just as on the owned portfolio credit losses increased notably, that's reflected in the expense section. But for securitized receivables, those higher credit losses are reflected in securitization income, and therefore, that had the impact of reducing the excess spread. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bruce Harting - Lehman Brothers. \n Bruce Harting - Lehman Brothers: Can you talk about the pricing you're seeing on this very strong loan growth that you're doing? That is question number one. Bring that to the degree you can talk a little bit about adding to your discussion of liability hedging, but any kind of a forecast for net interest margin going forward, if you could.  With regard to credit normalization and bankruptcy, if you could just comment on where you see that going from here, and maybe topping out, if you could. \nDan Henry: I think our pricing is staying pretty much in line with where we've been historically. As we've seen over the last several quarters, our net yield has held very well. This quarter we saw a drop in net yield. If you compare that to last year, the reason for the drop is the higher interest cost that we have this year compared to last year. That was partially offset by the fact that we have fewer receivables on introductory rates. So that actually helped to hold the yield up.  If you look at it compared to last quarter, the primary change had to do with revolve rates. That's a relatively common seasonal change that we see. Our pricing hasn't changed, and our yield is holding up as expected. In terms of whether credit is returning to normal levels, I think it's certainly moving up more towards normal levels. As we see both at American Express and throughout the industry, early write-offs continue to be well below where they have been historically. Over time, how there's a balance between early write-offs and just contractual write-offs, people who don't pay us but don't go bankrupt, that may change over time. So we'll have to actually see how that plays out into the future.  So overall, we're very pleased with the yield within the receivable base. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW. \n Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: I know you guys are going to spend some time at your conference on this, but I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the GNMS segment. Not sure if you guys look at it this way, but the pre-tax margin on that segment, somewhere in the range of 43%, kind of year-to-date, versus 35%, roughly, last year. Could you just provide some color on how we should think about it on a go-forward basis? \nDan Henry: So as you know, we don't provide forecasts in terms of anything including margins. I think what you're seeing there is very strong billed business, and the revenues related to that are being reflected in part within the GNMS segment. The tight control over marketing and operating costs that we discussed does not only relate to segments one and two, it also relates to GNMS. So I think what you're seeing there is strong billed business growth, as well as very good cost control on operating expenses, and a clear focus in terms of the marketing expenditures as well. That's what I think is having the most notable impact in terms of the improvement on margins.  Let me just make one comment before we take the next question, as it relates to the question that Meredith asked. Let me just also note that if you were looking at excess spread on a sequential basis, in the first quarter of this year we also had the $80 million impact of the accounting change as it relates to the I/O strip that was on that line. So if you're looking at that information, that's something to keep in mind as well.  With that I'll take the next question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom - UBS. \n Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: I just want to return to this topic of the efficacy of the rewards spend. It would seem that the rewards spend, as strong as billed business growth has been, seems to be far outpacing it. I'm wondering how we should continue to think about that? \nDan Henry: I'm not sure where, Eric, we would see that it is far outpacing that. If you look at this quarter, if you adjust for the adjustment to the redemption rate last year, we had growth of about 14%, which is a combination of both rewards cost as well as marketing. The increase on the marketing side in this quarter, absent the $68 million of additional spending we were able to do because of the income tax benefit, even absent that, was up very strongly and significantly. That was based on the strength of our overall business.  So, I'm not sure exactly what statistics you're looking at that would indicate that rewards are growing much faster than billed business. \n Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: So I guess your position would be that the efficacy of each dollar invested remains undiminished. Is that true? \nDan Henry: Yes. I think we're getting very, very good returns for both the marketing spending that we're doing; we think we're getting a very good payback for the rewards that we're offering to our customers, and the combination of our overall strategy and our focus on spend and acquiring affluent customers. The overall economics is playing out very well, as you can see in both this quarter's results, as well as the results over the past several quarters. \nOperator: Your next question comes from James Fotheringham - Goldman Sachs. \n James Fotheringham - Goldman Sachs : In the release you say that given your momentum, you'll be looking to capitalize on opportunities to further strengthen your lead in the payments industry. I was just wondering, can you elaborate on that comment? Specifically, what's the nature of these initiatives? Are you considering both organic and strategic options? I don't know what you can share here, but any additional color on this relatively cryptic comment would be most appreciated. Thanks. \nDan Henry: I think what we're saying is that we are in a very good position compared to the major competitors. We are performing very well from a spend perspective, very well from a loan perspective; we're acquiring new cards-in-force; and at the same time, having good growth in both revenues as well as net income.  So what we're saying is we think we're really performing very well, which is really the result of business-building initiatives that we've had over many years, when it appears that some of our competition isn't enjoying the same level of success in terms of their business results. What we're saying is we're going to continue to spend on business-building initiatives to further capitalize on the momentum we have and continue to perform at very strong levels.  So we're simply indicating that we're committed to growing the business over the medium to long term. We're very committed to investing in both rewards and marketing expenditures to continue the strong growth that we've had. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Ball - Citigroup. \n Brad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: A follow-up question on GNS. I think you said that adjusted for the sales and transfers, that you saw billed business growth in GNS of about 41%. How much of that was international versus domestic? Could you just remind us, have you in the last 12 months signed any new U.S. partners that would have been significantly buoying that, or was that driven largely by the partners that you had in place?  Just one quick follow-up. Could you comment on the profitability on the earnings numbers and results overall in the international bank for the quarter? Thanks. \nDan Henry: You're right, the GNS billed business growth adjusting for the three markets that were transferred in was 41%. In the U.S. we continue to see growth in excess of 100%. Internationally the growth continues to be robust as well so, our growth in GNS is strong. We did not sign any new U.S. partners in the quarter, although the business within the U.S., obviously, based on the numbers I cited, are continuing to grow in a very strong manner.  As it relates to the international bank, we do not disclose that separately, although I guess I would describe the amount of their income as it relates to the total American Express income as modest. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. I was hoping you could clarify the incremental change in interest expense that you expect in the last half of the year, if you could maybe go back over that? As the additional hedges run off, how much of a ramp-up are you looking for in interest expense? \nDan Henry:  As it relates to the hedges that expired at the end of 2006, a combination of fixed-rate debt and hedges, there was about $11 billion worth, we will incur about $130 million of higher interest expense in the second half of '07 compared to last year related to that $11 billion.  As it relates to the unhedged portion, today, interest rates stand at about the same level that they did in the second half of last year. So, if short-term interest rates do not change, then we would not have a grow-over related to the unhedged portion. Obviously, if short-term rates change, then there will be an impact. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray:  Then on a trend basis, the interest expense as a percentage of debt outstanding from here, assuming from the second quarter level, should be relatively steady. Is that from the second quarter? You still have the grow-over of $130 million additional from the hedged. \nDan Henry:  As it relates to the piece that was hedged, in the first quarter we said the impact was $60 million or a little north of that. In the second quarter it again was $60 million, and we'll dimensionally see a similar impact in the third and fourth quarter. So, that impact isn't going to change as we go into the second part of the year. It will be higher than what we had last year.  As it relates to the unhedged piece, if you're thinking about it from a grow-over position, in the first and second quarter of '06, short-term rates were lower than they are or they were, in the first and second quarter this year. Therefore, we had a grow-over on that piece.  If short-term interest rates remain unchanged, then related to the unhedged piece, the interest cost would be about the same, on the same level of debt. Obviously, because our business is very strong, the level of debt will be higher in the second half of '07 but the rate would be similar on the unhedged piece. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Hochstim - Bear Stearns. \nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: I wanted to try again about the average cost of redeemed rewards and whether that's increased from a year ago. I understand you're not going to disclose what it is, but has it increased on average from a year ago?  If you can clarify, when you reclassify the financials after this quarter, will you be providing the corporate segment as well, so that we can true up the entire income statement this time? \nDan Henry: Our average costs of redemptions this year are flat with what we had last year. So we've been very focused on both adding value to our customers as well as controlling costs. The average cost year-over-year is basically flat from period to period. On the point about corporate, we endeavor to provide information that we think will be useful, although I understand that we don't provide a separate income statement by line for that segment.  As we've discussed before, we think we're providing relevant information that, hopefully, will be helpful to you in terms of doing your analysis. But currently, we're not planning to provide a separate income statement for the corporate segment at this time, David. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Bruce - Merrill Lynch. \n Ken Bruce - Merrill Lynch: I'm hoping you might be willing to elaborate a little on your comments about the marketing or rewards investments. This quarter appears that maybe it normalized, certainly relative to the first quarter. So, when we think through in terms of how much flexibility you have going forward, is it fair to benchmark Q2 as maybe something in the trend line for acquisitions and loyalty, and if you really need to cut back on your investment spending in marketing, that we'd see something more closely related to Q1? This is net the $68 million that you've already identified, so if you just kind of look at the marketing spend in Q2 versus Q1, if Q2 would be normal and Q1 would be your bare-bones investments, please. \nDan Henry: Certainly Ken, as we think about the first quarter, that certainly would be something that I would categorize as bare bones. Marketing spend has increased significantly in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, up to a level that I would consider to be a healthy level. As you know, in prior quarters at some points we've actually invested more than that, and in others, slightly less than that. But I think we're back to healthy levels in the second quarter.  Really, when you think about it, our main focus is on the medium to long term. We will invest in marketing to ensure that we continue to have the type of business momentum that we currently have. It may fluctuate a little bit from quarter to quarter, but the main focus is to continue to bring on cards to stimulate customers to drive the type of spending that we like.  So I think we'll continue to see some fluctuations but you're right; we have had a significant increase in the second quarter to levels that enable us to do much of the marketing that we'd like to do although certainly there are still some areas where we've held back, and at some point we'd like to start to invest in some of those areas as we move through the year.  Now, as you think about the balance of the year, as we said, our greatest challenge is in the earlier part of the year. As we move into the latter part of the year, some of those challenges are not as steep. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets. \n Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets: I view the domestic card business in two parts, the balance billed, as well as the charged. I guess the charge card generates a much higher ROE than the balance billed. I was curious if internally if management looks at this and says we have to balance or control growth in the balance side to allow for the ROE to remain high? Is there any process internally that does that, or is it just grow balance prudently and grow charge prudently? \nDan Henry:  Our focus is really spend-centric. What we are trying to do is acquire customers who will spend at a higher level than what you see on the other networks. We allow the customer to decide whether they want to do that on a co-brand product, a lending product, or a charge product. So it's really the customer who is making the decision. What we try to do is make sure that we have very good value propositions in each of those categories, so the customer will be attracted to the American Express Company.  All of the investments that we make, whether it be on the charge side or the lending side, we ensure that we have the type of returns that are attractive to our shareholders. We also get a boost in ROE from our GNS business, where we're earning fee revenue but are not carrying balances. So when you look at the aggregate of the performance of charge, lending, GNS, we're winding up with a composite that's very good from a growth in spend as well as a return on equity. \nOperator: Your final question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nBob Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Just broadly wondering what you're seeing out of the health of the consumer in the U.S. particularly. I don't know if you can expand on that globally at all. I would be interested in your viewpoint. \nDan Henry: I think what we saw in the first quarter for American Express, on a billed business basis, consumer growth this quarter was the same as last quarter. That was true for small business as well. I think corporate services was down just a tick, but very comparable to last quarter. So we continue to see within American Express very strong spending from both the consumer, small business and corporate sectors.  Internationally, if you adjust for FX and adjust for the transfer of the three businesses, it was a healthy 10% growth on an FX-adjusted basis. So we're continuing to see very strong spending on the part of our customers. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, do you have any closing comments? \nDan Henry:  No, we don't have any closing comments. Thank you, everyone for participating in the call. Thank you very much, and have a good evening."}], "2009": [{"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 4, "year": 2008, "date": "2009-01-26 22:08:13", "content": "Executives: Ronald Stovall \u2013 Senior Vice President, Investor Relations Kenneth Chenault \u2013 Chief Executive Officer Daniel Henry \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAnalysts : Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus  David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup  Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods [Bill Karachi]  Richard Shane \u2013 Jefferies & Co.

(Operator Instructions) I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ronald Stovall. Please go ahead. \nRonald Stovall :  Welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s discussion. It is my job, as usual, to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.   The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K Report and in the company\u2019s 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   In the fourth quarter 2008 earnings release, supplement and presentation slides which are now posted on our website at www.ir.americanexpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K Report, we have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.  Kenneth Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Express will provide some brief opening comments. Then Daniel Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings document provided and provide some brief summary comments.   Once Daniel completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where both Kenneth and Daniel will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourselves to one question at a time during the Q&A.   With that, let me turn the discussion over to Kenneth. \nKenneth Chenault : Thanks Ron. Before Dan reviews the details I wanted to say a few words about the economic environment, our results and the outlook for 2009. I believe and I think most of you would agree that this is one of the most difficult operating environments we have seen in decades. The housing market has continued to deteriorate, unemployment has risen significantly and retailers have seen some of the biggest declines in many years.  Now, as we all know, consumer confidence has dropped off the charts and corporations have acted quickly to pull back on their expenses. What we have also seen following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September, the wholesale credit markets came to a virtual standstill as concerns about the underlying value of troubled assets eroded trust in the banking sector and spurred a series of new initiatives from Washington.  Now our results for the quarter were significantly impacted by this environment. Revenues declined as spending by consumers, small businesses and corporations slowed significantly. As you have seen from recent headlines the slow down was more pronounced among high end retailers and throughout the travel sector as our card members cut back on discretionary spending. Now, as expected we continued to see rising delinquencies and loan write offs.  These trends, together with the restructuring charge we took to reduce our cost base drove our earnings decline for the quarter. Clearly we are disappointed with our overall results. Nevertheless, despite the environment there are a number of developments we can point to that show progress against our near-term priorities which are staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively to strengthen our competitive position over the longer term.  First, we continued to remain solidly profitable in the fourth quarter and generated $2.8 billion in earnings in 2008. Next, our spending declines while significant compared favorably to major competitors in the industry particularly in view of the overall cutbacks in travel and discretionary spending in the latter part of 2008. Very importantly average card fees and discount rates which generate two of our largest revenue streams were virtually unchanged reflecting the ongoing value that card members and merchants see in working with Amex.  Now this is in contrast to the pattern you have seen in much of the retailing industry. We are not cutting our premium prices in order to generate business volumes and I believe this is a very good indication of the underlying strength of our franchise. We have stepped up re-engineering efforts for which we took a significant restructuring charge in the quarter and we have already begun to reduce operating expenses which gives us additional flexibility as we move into 2009.  Now in terms of funding we are more than satisfied our requirements for the quarter and we have broadened our sources to include a retail certificates of deposit program that we launched in October. Since then we have been able to generate $6.2 billion from a standing start which I think is very strong evidence of the drawing power of the Amex brand.  For the longer term we continue to invest selectively in the business, strengthening our partnership with Delta Airlines in the quarter, continuing to build our global business with banks, to issue cards on the Amex network and successfully integrating the corporate card business we purchased from GE earlier in the year. Beyond these specific business items, as you know we converted to a bank holding company in the fourth quarter. This means that we will be regulated by the Federal Reserve and it aligns us more closely with other financial services companies. In January we bolstered our capital position and we added $3.4 billion as part of the TARP program. Now this additional capital will enhance our ability to extend loans to credit worthy card members, thereby helping to spur economic growth in the U.S.  Looked at from the perspective of our charge card portfolio we authorized about $73 billion in spending from consumers, small businesses and corporate card members in the quarter. On the lending side our open credit lines were on par with last year despite the difficult conditions in the marketplace. Our aim here is to accommodate card members\u2019 spending needs while helping to ensure that they don\u2019t incur debt levels that are inappropriate for the current environment.  As you know, throughout the past year we were very cautious about the economic outlook. That certainly continues to be the case today and looking ahead we expect difficult economic conditions to continue through 2009. As we said last quarter card member spending in this environment is likely to remain very soft and we continue to expect past due loans and write offs to rise from current levels.  Our strategies for 2009 remain focused on keeping liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively to strengthen our franchise and remain in position to capitalize on opportunities when conditions improve.  We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the banking sector and that the investments we are making in our business including the business-to-business sector which is less reliant on credit will help ensure we can capitalize on those opportunities when the environment improves.  With that let me now turn things over to Dan. \nDaniel Henry:  Thanks Kevin. Let me start on slide two. Total revenues net of interest expense were $6.5 billion, 11% down from 2007. It was negatively affected by foreign exchange. On a foreign exchange adjusted basis it would have been down 7%. Income from continuing operations was $238 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.21. Our ROE was 21.7%. This is a 12-month rolling average and it benefits from the stronger earnings earlier in the year.  All of these top line results reflect the current environment as well as certain significant items in each period. When we look at slide three we see these significant items. First for the fourth quarter of 2008 is the re-engineering charge of $273 million on a net income basis. Pre-tax it is $404 million. When we announced the restructuring reserve in October we estimated it would be between $370-440 million so we are within the range.  Next relates to Delta. In signing the new contract with Delta we agreed to reimburse them at a higher rate for membership rewards points that are converted to Delta miles and therefore we needed to re-price our reserve. It is $66 million on an after-tax basis, $106 million on a pre-tax basis.  In 2007 the fourth quarter included the Visa litigation settlement of $1.1 billion as well as additional business building, some litigation costs as well as a contribution to our charitable foundation. Net it had a beneficial impact on the fourth quarter of 2007 of $534 million.  2007 also included an enhancement in the way we estimate the ultimate redemption rate for membership rewards and resulted in a charge, after tax, of $430 million. In the fourth quarter of 2007 we also set up an additional credit related charge which had the impact of $274 million on the fourth quarter.  Let me take a minute on slide four and talk to some of the changes in reporting that you will see in the income statement. The first relates to interest income and the interest expense categories. Historically we showed interest income broken between card member lending finance revenue and other interest income. In the future we will show interest and fees alone, a second line, interest and dividends and investment securities and third deposits with banks and others.  In interest expense we previously broke interest expense between card member lending and interest on charge card and other. In the future we will show interest expense based on the source of the funding so we will show interest on deposits, short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings and other. In addition to that provision which previously was included in expense will now be moved up into revenues below the interest net of interest expense line and we will total to a total revenue net of interest expense after provision for losses.  I would also note that previously we had a line which was marketing promotions and card member services. Many of you will be pleased to know now we are going to break this into three lines which will be marketing and promotions, card member rewards and card member services. In the past we had called line item salaries and benefits or I guess we called it human resources which would now be called salaries and benefits. In addition there will be an impact on some of our metrics. It has always been our policy for charge cards to write off at 360 days. Bank holding company guidelines require us to write off at 180 days. So in the fourth quarter we are moving U.S. card services to a 100 day write off. If you were to look at the tables attached to the press release on pages 14-19, you will see write offs in the fourth quarter totaled $669 million. That includes $341 million which is the effect of moving us from 360 up to 180 days.  On those tables you should also see that the loss reserve coverage as a percentage of receivables is 2.5%. In the third quarter it was 3%. We have not gone back and restated prior periods. If we had continued the 360 day write off that ratio actually would have been 3.5%. So the increase in the third quarter to the fourth quarter reflecting our metrics in the fourth quarter.  As it relates to the international consumer as well as commercial card we will move those products to 180 days in the future. There are also a number of credit reserve re-classes but they had a minor impact on our metrics.  Moving to page five and looking at metrics, billed business came in at $160 billion, down 10% from last year or 5% on an FX adjusted basis. These results are in line with the industry. Given our affluent base with a high level of discretionary spending as well as the amount of [T&E] within our base we thought we may in fact come in at a lower amount than competitors but that was not the case. Notwithstanding that billed business has dropped significantly, on an FX adjusted basis we actually grew 11% in the first quarter, 10% in the second quarter, 7% in the third quarter and now have dropped to a decline of 5% and this reflects the impact of the economy on billed business.  Notwithstanding these lower results compared to last year if you look at total billed business for the full year which came in at $683 billion is the highest annual amount we have had in our history.  Total cards in force have held up very well at 7%. That is 2% growth in our proprietary cards as well as a 22% increase in network partner cards. Average spend per card member as you can see is down 14% or 10% on an FX adjusted basis and this is really the story that has led to the decline in billed business. Transactions in the United States basically flat, down 1% and transactions are actually up 6% internationally so it reflects card members spending less per transaction.  Loan growth on a managed basis was 7% down more than our competitors. This reflects both the economy, the credit actions we are taking and the fact that we have lower amounts of balanced transfer than we have historically.  Moving to slide six. Discount revenue is down 11%. On a managed basis it was down 7% and was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange. A positive note is that our average discount rate only declined 1%. As we can see from net card fees we are up 6%. This reflects the premiumness of our brand in the marketplace. Within that interest and securitizations, securitization income was down 39% with the major impact being credit losses. Net interest was down 16% on lower loans and was also impacted by the prime LIBOR dislocation that happened in October, however the normal relationship of those two metrics are back to normal levels now in January. It also reflects the higher cost of liquidity.  Now let me move to slide seven. Here you can see total provision on a reported basis was up 3%. However as I noted before one of the significant items was the additional provision we made in the fourth quarter of 2007. We added $96 million to the charge provision in 2007, $288 million to the lending provision and $384 million to the total provision. If we were to back those numbers out of the 2007 column provision on lending would have increased 36%, charge would have increased 32% and the total would have been up 32%. That higher provisioning reflects the higher credit loss metrics that I will discuss in a few minutes.  Moving to slide eight I will discuss the metrics within our business unit. In USCS the metrics are very much in line with total company metrics. Billed business in the first quarter was up 11%, 8% in the second quarter, 6% in the third quarter and now down 9%. That reflects 12% decline in the consumer business and a 3% decline in small business. The 2% increase in cards in force reflect investments we have been making. Again, here billed business is being driven down by average spend. As I said, transactions in the U.S. were only down 1%. Average spend was down really across most card groups and spending levels. Card member loans are down for the same reasons that I cited a few minutes ago.  Moving to slide nine is the metrics for international consumers. The international consumer actually held up better than the U.S. in the fourth quarter. While billed business was down 14% on a reported basis, it was actually up 1% on an FX adjusted basis. If we look across all the regions on an FX adjusted basis it was flat in each of the regions. Again, average card member spend is what is the driving force behind the lower growth business. Card member loans were lower by 15% on a reported basis but up 4% on an FX adjusted basis.  Moving to slide ten, global commercial services metrics, here again we see a drop in the fourth quarter. On an FX adjusted basis commercial card billed business at $28 billion was down 5% in the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis compared to actually an increase of 7% in the third quarter. If we look at the fourth quarter, billed business in the U.S. was down 6% and internationally on a reported basis was down 18% but only 3% on an FX adjusted basis. Cards in force are up 4% as we continue to bring in new customers and here we have a similar story as it relates to average card member spend which was down 8% on an FX adjusted basis.  Moving to slide 11, GNMS, here we can see that in total the U.S. billed business was down 8% and actually was up 3% outside the U.S. on an FX adjusted basis. Within the U.S. retail and every day spending declined 6% and that represents about 74% of U.S. billed. Travel and entertainment declined 10%. As I noted before the average discount rate at 2.53% has held up very well only down 1 basis point from last year.  Global network services continues to be a good store. Billed business was flat on a reported basis but grew 11% on an FX adjusted basis. Cards issued by network partners that ride on our network increased 22%. Moving to slide 12 we will look at expenses. Here are the significant items that I mentioned on slide three as having a notable impact on these line items. If I were to adjust the items that are listed on slide three if we look at marketing and promotion and adjusted 2007 for the $143 million of incremental spending we did as a result of the Visa settlement marketing and promotions would be down 21% year-over-year. If we look at card member rewards and we adjust for the $106 million of additional provision we made in 2008 related to the Delta contract and we made an adjustment to 2007 for the increase related to the enhancement in the ultimate redemption rate estimate of $685 million card member rewards would actually be down 10% in line with volume.  If we look at salaries, employee benefits and other operating expenses if we adjusted 2008 to back out the restructuring impact of $404 million and the $16 million for the engineering in 2007 and we also adjusted for the Visa litigation settlement as well as the litigation costs and contribution to the charitable foundation we would actually be down 7%. If we look at income tax and the benefit that we had in the period it is the result of the consistent level of recurring permanent tax benefits and the impact of that benefit where we have lower pre-tax income as well as benefits related to the finalization of our state tax returns.  Moving to slide 13 and looking at charge card net write off rate you can see that the results are pretty consistent over the year and have held up reasonably well. The fourth quarter on this chart does not include the $341 million write off moving from 360 day write off up to 180 day write off.  If we move to slide 14 and look at charge card net loss ratio for international consumer and the global commercial services you can see that the international consumer net loss is increasing reflecting somewhat higher loss rates across most companies most notably Mexico. Commercial card net loss rate has remained reasonably stable.  Moving to slide 15 the charge card 30 day past due amount we can see that the card charge in the U.S. past due is increasing slightly as we continue to control credit losses very well within the charge card portfolio.  If you move to slide 16, charge card 90 days past due for international consumer and global commercial card you can see that the write off rate for 90 day past due is increasing in international and that is really across all of the international markets and also increasing somewhat in the global commercial. Both of these reflect the environment we are experiencing.  If we move to slide 17 in the middle you can see that the international consumer write off rate is holding up pretty well so I will focus on the U.S. lending numbers. The write off rate of 6.7% is up dramatically from the 3.4% rate in the fourth quarter 2007. We have moved from being the lowest rate in the industry to the middle of the pack. Our write off rate has grown at about 100 basis points faster than the industry year-over-year and this reflects what we have discussed before that we have a higher percentage of small business than the competition, we have more affluent customers in California and Florida and we also grew at a faster rate over the past two years. If we look at this sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter our increase is very much in line with the industry.  Our write off rate when you look at a comparison to competitors because we have a decline in loan balances there is actually a negative impact in our relationship because as loans go down it reduces the denominator and is therefore impacting the write off calculation. The last point I would make here is when we set our higher or provided an additional reserve in the second quarter of this year we anticipated write off dollars would be higher in the third or fourth quarter and in fact they have come in and played out very much as we had expected back in June.  Moving to slide 18 lending managed 30 days past due, here you can see that the 30 day past due continued to rise in the fourth quarter in USCS increasing by 80 basis points and this was really very much in line with industry increases. Based on this increase in the 30 day past due we would expect the first quarter 2009 write off will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 will be higher than the first quarter of 2009.  Moving to slide 19 we can look at capital. Here for the full year 2008 in the right hand column you can see we generated $1.9 billion of capital over the year. If we look at the fourth quarter even with the restructuring reserves we generated sufficient capital to cover our dividends.  Moving to slide 20 these are our capital ratios. Capital to total managed assets and total tangible capital to total managed assets. You can see these metrics strengthened over the first three quarters. The drop in the ratio in the fourth quarter is largely due to a decrease in OCI or other comprehensive income within the equity section due to lower net security valuations and pension valuations. Each ratio improved at the end of 2008 compared to the end of 2007.  Moving to slide 21 we are providing the three key bank holding company ratios. These ratio calculations are preliminary and have not been reviewed by the regulators. These ratios are generally comparable to our competitors and above the well capitalized bench mark. Historically our capital has been in line with an A rated company based on discussions with the rating agencies and regulators and endorsed by the marketplace as we were able to issue long-term debt to fund our business.  Without TARP we may have needed or had a desire to increase our total risk based capital ratio. If we had done that we may have had to constrain the granting of credit. However, with TARP we do not believe this is the case. As Ken indicated a good indicator of this is the unused line of credit. While we have been reducing lines on customers we viewed as risky we were also increasing lines to our existing customers who were credit worthy and we were bringing on new card members. So in total we think the unused line of credit at the end of this year will be on par with the amounts that we had at the end of last year. TARP is enabling us to continue to provide credit to the marketplace.  If we move to slide 22 let me spend a few minutes talking about liquidity. This slide is the exact slide that we had in the third quarter call. In that call we had a column for 6 months as well as for 12 months. This is the 12 month column. During the fourth quarter we have significantly enhanced our liquidity position. As of the third quarter we were basically looking at short-term liquidity to help us bridge to our contingent funding sources such as the $5 billion ABS financing conduit that we had with seven banks. While it was a very sound plan it was contingent upon drawing upon the facilities that we had in place.  If we actually move onto slide 23 and look at the activity that is taking place in the fourth quarter you can see that we have ending excess cash of $13 billion and if you include the TARP $3 billion funds that we received on the 9th of January we would have $16 billion of excess cash which could be used to help meet the long-term debt that is maturing in 2009. So we are not relying on contingent sources any longer we now have excess cash and marketable securities in hand.  So how did we get there? Since we are not relying on short-term assets to bridges to our contingent facilities we reduced short-term obligations by $10 billion. This big news is that we have been able to raise $9 billion in retail CD\u2019s as well as sweep accounts in the fourth quarter. Brokered CD\u2019s increased by $6 billion. This is a program that we actually started at the beginning of the quarter and we increased sweep deposits by $3 billion. This demonstrates the power of our brand in the marketplace.  We also issued $6 billion under the temporary liquidity guarantee program so at the end of December 2008 we had $21 billion in cash. We need about $4 billion of that to meet our working capital needs and we would need about $9 billion of that to pay off our short-term obligations. So after doing those two things if we add in our liquidity investment portfolio which is held in treasuries we have $13 billion of cash on hand at the end of December including the $3 billion of TARP we received early in January.  As we move to the next slide 24 you can see that our 2009 long-term debt maturities totaled about $20 billion. Now if we were growing volumes and loan balances and AR were increasing we would have higher funding requirements than the $20 billion. In a weak economy with lower billed business and lower loan balances it is likely we will actually have lower requirements than the $20 billion and we have $16 billion on hand to address that.  If we move to slide 25 it is our plan as we move into 2009 to use the excess cash that we have on hand to likely issue under the TLG Program where we could issue up to an additional $7 billion and we plan to continue to grow our retail deposits. As I mentioned the average maturity on retail CD\u2019s is about 20 months. I also note that we have already raised in deposits an additional $1.5 billion in the month of January. We also plan to launch a new direct deposit program in the second quarter of 2009. So going forward it is our plan at the end of each quarter to have excess cash and marketable securities equal to the next 12 months of maturities. In addition to that we still have commercial paper program, we have access to the Fed TALP as well as the discount window and we have our committed bank lines. If the ABS or unsecured markets were to open we would access those.  With that let me conclude with a few final comments. Despite the effects of a particularly difficult economic environment and the restructuring charge we remained profitable for the fourth quarter and for the full year generating $2.8 billion of earnings from continuing operations. While throughout the quarter card member spending was under pressure our decline in spending compared relatively well to other major card competitors. In light of our proportionately greater level of corporate and consumer discretionary spend we feel good about the relative strength of our business activities.  As we expected credit indicators weakened further during the quarter against the backdrop of rising unemployment, continued declines in the housing sector and overall deterioration in global stock market values. As Ken outlined at the beginning of the call for 2009 we remain focused on three key corporate goals; to stay liquid, to stay profitable and to selectively invest for the long-term. We believe that attaining these goals will best position us to emerge from this downturn as a strong competitor.  Through our fourth quarter funding activities we more than met our funding needs and built an excess cash position. This position reflects our $6 billion issuance of the TLG program as well as our success in building more retail deposits which now total $13.3 billion. We believe this excess cash position, our additional capacity under the TLG program and the potential to further grow our deposit base will satisfy all our maturing debt obligations and fund our normal business operations for in excess of 12 months even if access to the capital markets continues to be disrupted.  We continue to expect that the difficult economic conditions will persist throughout 2009 and further suppress card member spending. In addition our financial results will reflect continued deterioration in the credit environment as well as the negative denominator impact of lower overall lending balances. This decline in balances is a function of the tempered spending environment as well as our proactive credit actions that we have implemented in 2008.  As a result we expect U.S. and worldwide write off rates will be higher in the first quarter 2008 [sic] than we saw in the fourth quarter and this year\u2019s second quarter rates will be higher than the first quarter. The $1.9 billion re-engineering program that we began implementing in the fourth quarter is an important factor in our ability to address these profitability challenges. However, we are committed to pursue additional expense initiatives in the event that further reductions are warranted.  Additionally the various pricing actions that we have implemented and the anti trust settlement payments expected from Visa and MasterCard provide us with additional sources of financial flexibility.  As we evaluate our investment decisions throughout this year we will work to prudently balance near-term performance against long-term profitability and growth. For the current economic turnaround to negatively impact our results our goal is to position the company to generate returns in excess of our dividend levels. Collectively we believe these strategies appropriately position us for the difficult period that lies ahead and should enable us to navigate through these conditions in the best possible position relative to our payment competitors and the overall industry.  In closing we remain committed to our business model. We have a strong and defined position within the payment industry, our brand is recognized and respected around the globe, our balance sheet is positioned with the capital funding and liquidity profile that should provide us with flexibility in these volatile times and across all our businesses we have instilled a strong focus on the customer. Someone we need stay close to regardless of the environment.  Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions. \n :\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital. \nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital: Can you speak in terms of the allowance for loan loss [inaudible audio] balance sheet during the course of the year and can you talk about the prospects for the prospects for the TALP program versus bringing loans back on the balance sheet and how we should model provisioning for that? \nKenneth Chenault:  Your voice is very weak but I think I got the essence of your question which is how do we think about the loan loss reserve for credit losses. We have a methodology we have used for many years which is really a migration analysis using recent historical data but we also look at what our coverage is of delinquencies. We look at what our coverage is looking backwards in terms of write offs and also looking forward in terms of write offs. It is also informed by the recent actions we have taken in terms of the card members we are bringing on, what we have done from a credit actioning perspective as well and we also are cognizant of what is taking place in the economy. So it is not just one factor that determines how we set the reserve for credit losses. It is really a combination of all those factors that drive that decision and that is what is reflected in our results for both the year and for the quarter.  In terms of if securitizations come back onto the balance sheet, I think we have about $5 billion of maturing ABS during 2009. If we bring them back on the balance sheet then we have a line of credit reserve those and those would be reflected in our P&L in 2009 and to bring them back on at a level that we thought was appropriate based on the conditions that exist in the quarter that they come back on. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank. \nMike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Can you comment on this enormous growth in the retail CD\u2019s? I think you said $9 billion so I guess the question is how are you getting this, who are you getting it from, what are the deposit rates, how sticky are these funds and what is the relative trade off in doing the retail CD\u2019s versus other funding? \nDaniel Henry :  Let me talk first to the retail CD\u2019s. We began that program in the beginning of October in the fourth quarter. They are retail CD\u2019s that are issued through the national brokerage firm. Customers who want to place money have a choice of who they do it with. They can pick us or other companies that are offering those rates. The rates we have offered are market rates we have not paid up in terms of price but we [think] a flight to quality and is really reflective of the power of our brand.  So $6 billion in the quarter and the average maturity of those was 20 months as I mentioned. That is one source. For about a year we have had a different program with a different set of institutional companies where their customers, they actually set the rate but their customers can pick from a variety of firms that they offer and we actually increased the amount from those sweep accounts by $3 billion. So we think from a stickiness perspective that while who the customers are who are accessing the sweep accounts may change we still think the quality of our name will help the stickiness.  In terms of the stickiness of the retail CD as I said it is 20 months. There is only $2 million of that $6 billion that have maturities under a year and the other $4 million have maturities in excess of a year. So it is our sense that we will have good stickiness and as I mentioned we are also going to start a direct deposit program that will be both online and off line and we expect to roll that out in the second quarter of 2009.  The average rate I just mentioned to give you a sense on retail CD\u2019s is 3.3%. So over time we will need to make an evaluation of whether we think deposits should be 20% of our funding base or 50% of our funding base but that is a decision we will make over time and will be based on having a good diversity of funding sources as well as based on price. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think the point is in a relatively crowded field where the number of people are going to deposits and if you will a late entry with that as a result of the brand and what it represents we have been able to dramatically grow in a very short rate of time. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of your feel, I know it is very difficult, but looking at the spending trends in the fourth quarter and the change in loan growth declining in the fourth quarter if you could try and give some outlook of what you are seeing so far in January versus the fourth quarter and has this deteriorated further? What is your best guestimate for spending and your loan portfolio for 2009? \nDaniel Henry:  I can give you some insight about what has happened so far in January. Spending levels have been pretty consistent with what we saw in December so not a further deterioration from there but consistent with what we saw in December. The factors that are contributing to the overall loan growth really is the low spending is the most impactful but the credit actions that we have put in place are also having an impact as we are focused on controlling credit losses in 2009. Although we continue to be very careful to balance between controlling credit losses and wanting to have very good relationships with our customers going forward so we can benefit from their spending both now and in the future when the economy improves.  I think the third factor is we are having less balance transfers than we have historically had. I think all three of those factors are contributing to the lower loan balances.  \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Do you have a feel for, or do you expect your lines to decline 10% this year, somewhere in that range? \nDaniel Henry:  I wouldn\u2019t give a forecast but I would say that there is a correlation between what spending levels are and where loan balances go. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Can you give us a little more detail on the thinking in your lending provision and reserve? A lot of other issuers had a pretty big increase in their reserves. I know you took a big build in the second quarter but you really saw a pretty material decline in the ratio of reserves to your delinquencies. Fourth quarter economic performance was pretty abysmal across the board and I think a lot of people are getting a pretty bearish outlook for 2009 and therefore I think the lending provision could have been higher. Can you just talk a little about what\u2019s behind your methodology with the reserve, unemployment rate you are benchmarking to as you go through 2009 and then also what is the driver of the negative 123 other in the reserve reconciliation? \nDaniel Henry:  I think our provisioning methodology as an answer to the first question is I guess I would note that our reserve as a percentage of past dues on a loan basis is 137% and that compares to last year we were at about 119%. While it was higher in the second and third quarter as I mentioned when we set up the reserve in the second quarter we were really looking forward and were anticipating higher levels of write off so the reserve as a percentage of past due at 137% we are pretty comfortable with.  If you also look at what the increase in write off rate was it increased about 75% and if you look at the percentage of reserves as a percentage of loans that has also increased a certain percentage. So as we think about our allowance levels triangulating from a variety of sources we are comfortable and I think the levels that we have today reflect the fact that we set up an additional provision in the second quarter of this year.  As it relates to the second part of your question in terms of 2009 as we are planning into 2009 while we don\u2019t do a forecast of where unemployment is going to be for planning purposes we are thinking that 2009 unemployment for planning purposes will rise up to about 8.5%. So that is the unemployment we are thinking about when we are doing our planning for next year.  The $122 million other in the quarter reflects some of the reserve re-classes that I mentioned before. They are small in totality but that is really what is a part of the $122 million. The other part is there is some FX translation that is impacting the reconciliation. It is some reserve reclassification and the impact of foreign exchange is what has generated the $122 million in the quarter. \nOperator:  The next question comes from David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Could you just talk about the trend in net interest yield and whether there was a lot of excess liquidity in the fourth quarter that played into the reduction or should that continue declining? Then I have two clarification questions. One on the Delta charge is that sort of a one-time charge or will you continue to have charges as you committed to higher cost of rewards and that the amount spent by Delta cardholders this quarter and how the overall higher cost will show up on the P&L? I also wasn\u2019t clear on the tax rate or what kind of tax benefit you would expect in 2009? \nDaniel Henry:  Let me answer the Delta question first. The $106 million was a one-time adjustment to the reserve to bring it up to the pricing we needed to satisfy redemptions in the future that we think will be made through Delta. Obviously the high cost per point on an annual basis as the future spending will be reflected in the cost pertaining to full membership rewards although I will point out that we have done a very good job in terms of membership rewards cost per point which has stayed relatively flat over a number of years. So that is the Delta question. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: So the $106 million reflects your expectation of what people will spend over the life of that program on Delta cards that is incremental to what you would have been providing as they spend? \nDaniel Henry:  Well what we do is we use the historical average cost per point as an estimate for what our cost per point will be in the future but we have mixed in the fact we think Delta will be a bigger proportion of cost [inaudible] proportion and therefore reflected in cost per point. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: That is MR and the Delta lending? \nDaniel Henry:  That is just MR. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: How does the higher cost for lending products come in? \nDaniel Henry:  Are you talking about\u2026?\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: The Delta lending credit card. So you are going to\u2026\nDaniel Henry:  We would hold the credit card agreement with them and we agree to reimburse them based on spending of customers who use the code red card and as they spend that we will reflect that in the P&L as we do today.  Moving to net interest income, I guess there are two factors. One is in October there was kind of a dislocation of the normal relationship between prime and LIBOR and on our variable rate lending products which is about 60% of the lending portfolio that spread between LIBOR and prime has generally run between 70-180 basis points. When LIBOR jumped up basically the spread between those for a couple of weeks was actually zero. Now today it has moved back to the normal relationship but for that month or so where it had moved away there was a negative impact with that and I think you are seeing that in the yield at the end of the day.  However, if you look at not only the yield but you are looking at net interest income to the extent we have moved to a space where our funding and liquidity is stronger because we are holding cash there is a cost to carry on that, the cost we are going to pay to borrow funds will be higher than the interest income we have for our investments because we plan to invest in relatively safe instruments either Treasuries, agencies or other instruments which are guaranteed by the government. So I think there will be some impact on net interest income on that.  Your last question about tax rate, I think it was your last question on tax rate, because the permanent difference is that we\u2019ve been there except the impact on the tax rate has always been smaller when pre-tax income is very high. Now that pre-tax income is lower the permanent differences haven\u2019t changed and it is having a bigger impact on taxes and that is why we actually have a benefit in the period.  I don\u2019t know if I got all your questions but I think I tried to cover them. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Don Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup. \nDon Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the regulatory environment and some of the funding issues made for it to be changing the way you look at your business near and long-term? \nDaniel Henry:  Well in terms of funding I think we have anticipated changes in the marketplace that took place in 2008. Earlier in the year we expanded our liquidity portfolio, we added the $5 billion conduit facility, we gained access to the Fed window and now we have moved to actually holding excess cash. So I think we have demonstrated the ability to adapt to the marketplace and develop very sound liquidity and funding programs and however the marketplace evolves we will be able to continue to adapt to the environment and fund clearly as we really have both in the past and in 2008.  In terms of other regulation that may come out as a result of changes in the TARP rules, we will have to wait and adapt to those. As they now stand I don\u2019t think the regulations that are required for companies that take TARP will have a negative impact on us. If new rules come out then we will have to adapt to those as they come.\nOperator:  The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I was trying to get a little bit more on this charge card accounting policy change. So the way to think about it is this is going to increase the run rate in the rate right? If yes, can you reconcile that with the reserve coverage decline? \nDaniel Henry:  It is not going to impact our P&L at the end of the day because when cards were 180 days past due we had them substantially reserved for. All we are really doing is changing the time period when we write them off. So we were writing them off at 360 days. We simply moved that up to 180 days and that is why you see the additional $341 million flowing through the write off line in the fourth quarter.  Now when they were at 360 obviously we had reserves to cover the vast majority of those historically. If you looked at reserve coverage as of the third quarter it was 3%. As you look at the table, I think on pages 14 and 19 of the attachments to the press release, that dropped down to 2.5%. But that is not a reduction in reserve coverage. What it really is is reflective of the fact we are not holding receivables on our books that are past 180 days. If you made that calculation for the fourth quarter if we had not changed to the 180 day write off and stayed at 360 that percentage of coverage would go from 3% up to 3.5% so it is actually a strengthening of the reserves in the fourth quarter but because of this change in write offs to 180 days it drops the calculation down to 2.5%. So it is actually a stronger reserve now than what we have had in the third quarter.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: So the rate won\u2019t change much. I mean obviously all else equal is what I am saying. \nDaniel Henry:  All else equal it should have no effect on our P&L going forward. Our P&L will be driven by what the loss experience is in the future. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I guess when we think about capital adequacy I understand regulatory capital is pretty strong but when we look at the tangible capital is there a minimum you are looking at from a tangible capital to managed asset standpoint and then maybe you could just tie that into some comments on the FAS 140 issues. What do you think about the implementation? Do you think it will be implemented or not? \nDaniel Henry:  Let me answer the second part of your question first. As far as FAS 140 right now I guess the rules have not been passed as yet. There is an exposure draft out there. If the receivables come back on balance sheet at the exposure draft\u2019s date it will be the first quarter of 2010 and we would just bring all the assets back onto the balance sheet as well as the reserves. We don\u2019t think that will have any impact on our business model or on our ability to do business going forward.  Remind me what the first part of that question was? \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: [Audio break] implications and then just tie that in to your expectations for that tangible capital to managed assets ratio. Is there a specific minimum level you are looking to maintain? \nDaniel Henry:  We don\u2019t have a specific minimum we would want to maintain. I think our tangible capital ratio is pretty strong. Certainly compared to our competitors. We don\u2019t have a floor that we have set for ourselves. I think we absolutely in terms of if we took on additional intangibles then after that we would have an appropriate level of ratio of tangible equity to assets. \nOperator:  The next question comes from [Bill Karachi]. \n[Bill Karachi] : On the roll forward of the reserve on page 14 can you just comment on describing the difference between the net write offs or I\u2019m sorry the provision being down 3% on an owned basis versus up 17% on a managed basis and then finally if you could also comment on the potential implications of some of the talk on bankruptcy law changes and write downs and related issues that would be great. \nDaniel Henry:  The major change is if you look at managed basis receivables went from $75 billion in the third quarter to $72 billion in the fourth quarter. If you look at the owned while $3 billion is on a smaller base it is a higher percentage so I think the difference is largely being driven by the fact the percentage decrease in owned receivables is larger than the percentage decrease in the managed receivables.  Switching to your second question about bankruptcy law I know there has been a lot of discussion about modifying mortgages and loans and the like but I am not aware of a conversation about the bankruptcy law judges changing or impacting how credit card companies are interfacing with their customers. Now we are very focused on credit as we have talked about many times and we are very focused on controlling credit losses but at the same time we do have care programs for customers who are having temporary difficulty and we work with them to see if we can accomplish something that both meets our needs and their needs. So we continue to focus on credit not only from a controlling expense and losses but we also focus on seeing if we have ways we can help customers when we think they are only in temporary difficulty. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Richard Shane \u2013 Jefferies & Co.\nRichard Shane \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Can you tell us in the context of the deposit growth where your programs were versus national average for the quarter so we can get some sense of how much of this is being driven by brand versus pricing? \nDaniel Henry:  The answer to that question I think the CD\u2019s as I said have an average maturity of 20 months and the average rate that we gained was 3.3%. So I don\u2019t have here exactly what the national averages are but we were pricing in the system with the market. We were not paying up to bring deposits. I think you will see those are pretty consistent with the rates that were offered in the quarter. \nRichard Shane \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: Looking at the numbers the capital generated matched the dividend exactly. Would there have been any indication in terms of covenants or related to TARP in your ability to pay the dividend if those two numbers hadn\u2019t been equal? \nDaniel Henry:  We have a very strong capital position. I am not aware of any contractual restrictions we would have based on other agreements we have in place we would have been able to pay the dividend and TARP does prevent you from doing repurchases, it does prohibit you from increasing the dividend while it is outstanding but I am not aware of any provisions of TARP that would prevent you from paying a common dividend even if you generated less capital in the quarter than you did when you were paying in the quarter. \nRichard Shane \u2013 Jefferies & Co.: So there is no income test related to the dividend from TARP? \nDaniel Henry:  Not that I\u2019m aware of. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Michael Dano \u2013 Sandler & O\u2019Neill. \nMichael Dano \u2013 Sandler & O\u2019Neill: I have a question on discount rate pricing. As you renew contracts with the merchants or have over the past six months or so could you give us a sense of the degree of push back you are getting from merchants given the premium pricing if at all and could you maybe just remind us what is sort of the average duration of contracts that you have with merchants? \nDaniel Henry:  It is always the case when you are dealing with merchants or any business you negotiate. The person that is paying early would like to have a lower rate. As we have said in the normal course just based on the great continuing shift in every day spend at merchants in the normal course our discount rate if you took all the actions with the decline at 2-3 basis points a year but as you have seen over the last couple of years we have been actually able to go back to certain merchants where we are bringing greater value, have a discussion with them about that and agree to pay a higher price. So this is not us just dominating them or forcing up the price it is really based on the value that we bring to the merchants and they have agreed to in some cases pay a higher price. A combination of that shift to every day spend and us going to merchants because we bring significant value has enabled us really to only have a 1% decline this year in the discount rate which I think is really a testimony to our brand. \nKenneth Chenault:  The other point I would make is the reality is we don\u2019t have a monopoly position with any merchant and the reality is that choice. What is critical in these times is we have invested, as we told you through the years, in programs improving our information management capabilities, our marketing capabilities and our targeting capabilities. So very frankly a number of our conversations over the last several months have been with merchants saying we want to do more with you on your marketing programs so we can build volume because people really obviously are trying to generate sales and this is where our marketing skills and some of the rewards capabilities we have in bringing in business to the merchants is valuable. So I think what it represents is a strategy that we have had in place over the last 4-5 years that has allowed us to maintain in a pretty narrow rein our discount rate which has made a pretty important difference for us. \nMichael Dano \u2013 Sandler & O\u2019Neill: On the duration of the average contract can you share that with us? \nDaniel Henry:  I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips right now. Generally they are multi-year contracts. I would say it is probably 2-3 years as the average life of a contract. \nKenneth Chenault:  I would say on two levels they are multi-year contracts and what we have also concentrated on doing with a number of what I call working merchants we in fact over the last 6-7 years have focused on signing even longer term contracts. That has been a very effective strategy for us. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Robert Peruzzi \u2013 UBS. \nRobert Peruzzi \u2013 UBS: On page 20 in discussing your capital position you discussed the change in OCI as the driver in the reduction of your tangible capital ratios. I\u2019m just wondering if you can size that on a dollar basis and maybe talk a little bit about the types of securities that are driving that? \nDaniel Henry:  I think on the securities side it is really the B and C charge that relate to our securitization that is what driving that piece. I think it was about $300-400 million of impact from that reduction in valuation on the B and C trenche. The other piece was the pension valuation and I think that was somewhat of a similar number. The two of them together is what really had the impact on the capital ratios. \nRobert Peruzzi \u2013 UBS:  With regard to the restructuring charges I\u2019m wondering can we use the allocation of those restructuring charges as kind of indicative as to where the expense reductions are going to occur? On a segment basis? \nDaniel Henry:  I guess I would also point out that employees who are part of our service delivery network are actually accounting wise held at corporate and then allocated out from an expense perspective so the restructuring charge related to those employees is actually in the corporate segment. Beyond that your assertion is right although the benefit of that lower number of employees that were relieved from the service center will get passed through the P&L over time in the segments. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Scott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. \nScott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey : As you pursue deposit growth, any change in bank acquisition? I know you have been fairly [notive] on acquiring a bank. Is there any change there? \nDaniel Henry:  I think we have always said we will always evaluate every opportunity but generally if you were going to acquire deposits by acquiring existing banks the vast majority of them would also acquire the assets of that bank and we would have to be very satisfied the assets of that bank would be ones we would be comfortable with from an exposure perspective as it relates to our shareholders so we have found that pursuing the path of deposits, retail CD deposits through brokers, the sweep account and also having a direct deposit business is a way that is very prudent of gathering deposits without having to be focused on acquiring assets you may not otherwise want. \nOperator:  The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: I was wondering if you could just talk a bit since you said that the decline in the reserve relative to delinquencies in the quarter was because the reserve had been built in the past. What I guess level of metrics would cause you to actually have to raise that back up again? \nDaniel Henry:  I think we would look at the actual experience that we had in the quarter, the impact it had on the reserve, also I think we became significantly more pessimistic about how the inherent risk in the portfolio base and our outlook in the economy. I think both current period economics as well as our perspective of the inherent risk. Other things that could impact it is if we were bringing on customers that were riskier you would have to increase the reserve or if you are actually tightening credit that would be a basis for reducing the reserve. So I think we include all those factors in evaluating whether at some point in the future we need to have an additional reserve. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: What would be the best way for us from the outside to be able to measure that? \nDaniel Henry:  I think you do it the same we do. We look at a variety of factors, not just one factor, and we obviously have visibility into the credit actions we are taking, the customers we are bringing on that you don\u2019t have and we also have visibility into our migration analysis which is not public but you can certainly triangulate against delinquency coverage that we have. You can look at the increase in loans compared to the increase in write off rates. I think it is the normal thing you would look at in terms of evaluating that. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think the other point Dan mentioned is the reserve that we took in the second quarter was projecting out several quarters and I think as you said the performance was within the estimates that we had set. So that goes back to how you balance off the different factors. \nDaniel Henry:  I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever want to lock in to just one metric and keep it at that level forever. I don\u2019t\u2019 think we\u2019d ever want to say we want to have a past due coverage of 130% and no matter what keep it there because in some cases you might be over-reserving and in some cases you may be under-reserving. I really do think from my perspective looking at a wide variety of factors including your method of base methodology is a thoughtful way of approaching provisioning and where the allowance should be set at the end of each quarter. \nOperator:  The next question comes from John Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \nJohn Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: As I look at the changes in actual number of card issuances this quarter it seems like there was about a 1% decline in the U.S., a smaller decline internationally and just over 1% in cards in the GCS business. Can you talk about it seems like there is a relative preference for investment of domestic versus international and commercial? Can you talk about whether or not that is true and what I should be inferring from that? Secondly, with regard to reserve and I hate to bring this topic back up again tonight but how should we be looking at the reserve as it relates to the amount of balance you expect in future periods because clearly one has expectations of loss and the second is the absolute balance that should be outstanding. I was wondering if you could provide a bit of clarity on that as well. \nDaniel Henry:  Just in the first question in terms of where we invest, we don\u2019t have a preference of one business unit over another on a universal basis. I think we look every quarter to see what business opportunities present themselves. If we think there is an opportunity to invest in commercial card that provides us with a greater return than we would have in our next incremental investment say in consumer card we will place the investment there. I think we are always looking at what is going to create the greatest economic return over the life of the customer and that is what really drives our business decisions in terms of where we put investments and how much we put in the U.S. consumer and how much we put in the international consumer, how much we put in global commercial card and what we invest in the network. As you know there are always investments you can make that can get you immediate metrics and then there are investments you need to make in your capabilities and infrastructure that you need to make over time. So we try to balance all of those things as we make the investment decisions. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think the important point is the optionality and flexibility we have in our card acquisition approach relative to other business models because we have a choice of a range of consumer products, charge card revolving, GNS our bank partnership obviously has limited risk and in these times that is something we obviously balance and look at and then when we look at the economics of our corporate card business and the penetration opportunities that we see both in the U.S. and around the world they are attractive. So this is something we are constantly calibrating but I think the key point is we have a range of options based on both the returns and the risk that we see out there in the marketplace. \nDaniel Henry:  As it relates to your second question we are setting reserves based on inherent risk on the balance sheet as of the balance sheet date so as of December 31. We are not taking into consideration whether the balance sheet and loan balances will go up or whether it will go down in the future. What we do look to the future is what do we think is happening in the economy and that is one of many factors that we will integrate into our thinking in terms of establishing our reserve balance. \nOperator:  The next question comes from John Williams \u2013 Macquarie Research. \nJohn Williams \u2013 Macquarie Research : I just wanted to ask with regard to behavioral changes you have seen within the rewards expense line have you seen people change how they are treating rewards? Have you guys seen an uptick in redemption of rewards over the last few months or even into January? \nDaniel Henry:  We have had this question from a fair number of analysts thinking that the economy would cause people to utilize membership rewards to a significantly greater degree and quite frankly to date we have not seen that. People continue to do redemptions. They continue to value the program but we have not seen a notable uptick in redemptions as a result of the slow down in the economy. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think we provide a wide variety of choices. People know we are going to innovate and they know we are going to be around. \nDaniel Henry:  Let me just close with a reminder that we will be hosting our financial community meeting on February 4 at 2:30 p.m. here at our company headquarters. At this meeting we will provide additional details on our results and our business strategies focusing on our goal to stay liquid, stay profitable and to selectively invest for the long-term. Thank you all for joining us. \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay after 7 p.m. ET today through midnight February 2, 2009.

(Operator Instructions) At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ronald Stovall. \nRonald Stovall : We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s discussion. As usual, it\u2019s my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K Report and in the company,\u2019s 2007 10-K Report already on file with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  In the third quarter 2008 earnings release, supplement and presentation slides which are now posted on our website at www.ir.americanexpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K Report, we have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Kenneth Chenault, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of American Express will provide some brief opening comments, then Daniel Henry, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings document provided and provide some brief summary comments.  Once Daniel completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where both Kenneth and Daniel will be available to respond to your questions.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Kenneth.\nKenneth Chenault : Thanks Ronald, before Daniel covers the results, I wanted to say a few words about the economic environment, the reengineering efforts planned for the fourth quarter and our perspective on funding.  Now given the difficult operating environment our business performed relatively well this quarter, we\u2019ve been very cautious about the economic outlook for most of this year, and that certainly continues today. But based on recent trends, we believe consumer and business sentiment is likely to deteriorate further and we see this translating into weaker economies around the global well into 2009.  Now the market turmoil of the past few weeks is clearly going to make conditions even more challenging. Card member spending in such an environment is likely to be very soft. Loan growth will be restrained and some of that will reflect the steps we\u2019re taking to lower credit risks. Now credit indicators are likely to reflect the weaker economy including a continued downturn in the housing sector. Now to prepare for this more difficult environment we are moving ahead with plans that will result in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter. Through a combination of cost reductions and revenue building actions, we expect to be able to free up a significant amount of resources that would be available to earnings starting in early 2009. We will continue to invest in longer-term business building actions and programs but we\u2019re going to be very selective with our investment dollars in this environment. Our intent is to be in the strongest possible position to weather an unsettled economy that will be with us well into 2009. In that context we outlined our funding position in an 8-K filing a few weeks ago and noted that we now have broader access to the Fed\u2019s discount window. The headline, so to speak, is this. I believe that we can absolutely stay liquid; we have contingency programs in place that would allow us to navigate through this environment for at least 12 months, even under extreme market conditions. Now by way of an update, since the filing we are now also in a position to participate in the commercial paper funding guarantee programs that were recently announced by the fund. In short, we feel very good today about our overall funding position.  We expect to be in a position to capitalize on growth opportunities once the environment improves. But for now our focus is on staying liquid in our funding, staying profitable in generating excess capital, and investing but very selectively in growth opportunities and we are confident that we can do all three.  Now I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Daniel, for his remarks and then we will be very happy to take your questions. \nDaniel Henry: Thanks Kenneth, so let me start on slide two with our top line financial information, revenues on a GAAP basis grew 3%. I would note that on a managed basis they grew 9%. Diluted EPS of $0.74 was 21% below 2007 as a result of a slowing in spend growth as well as higher credit losses. ROE remains very healthy at 27.8%. This performance is below our on average and over time financial targets and will continue to be as long as the economy remains weak. Looking now at slide three, we have a number of changes in reporting.  First AEIDC is an investment subsidiary of AEB which we closed the sale in the first quarter of this year and we agreed to retain this sub until September of 2009. Now that we are within one year, we are going to move this from continuing operations to discontinued operations. AEIDC has about $660 million of assets; cash represents $340 million of that total. We filed an 8-K on September 12 restating data back to 2006. Next is the net write-off rate, as you know we have historically included principal, interest, and fees in our calculation of net write-off rate. Back in the first quarter, I indicated that we would be moving to the industry standard that only includes principal in the write-off rate.  So we have done that this quarter and we have restated the prior period information. Next is the 30-day past due methodology change. As you know we have various cycles throughout the month, they don\u2019t all end at the end of the month. It is the practice in the industry to take cash received after the cycle cut, which could be anytime during the month, and apply it to the oldest delinquency bucket.  We had not done that in the US and so we are now changing to the industry standard and again prior period information has been restated for that.  Turning to slide four and speaking about capital, despite the impact of the slowing economy on our results, through earnings, we retained or increased capital by over $600 million in the third quarter and by almost $2 billion year-to-date. This demonstrates our capital generation power of our business model. We did not repurchase shares in the third quarter and we do not plan to repurchase shares as long as the economy remains weak.  Instead, we will continue to build capital. Looking at slide five, our metric performance, billed business continues to grow faster then our competition at 8%, although it has slowed. In the first quarter, our billed business grew by 14% and in the second quarter by 12%.  During the third quarter while the average was 8% growth, September grew at 5% and we have seen a further slowing in the first 15 days of October. Business was stronger in international consumer, global corporate card, and G&S, although we did see some slowing in the third quarter in each of these businesses. In the quarter, we added two million net new cards since the second quarter and 7.4 million net new cards since last year.  In the quarter, we had 4% growth in proprietary cards and 25% in network cards. If we look at managed loans, we had growth of 5%. This is about the same as our competitors. We are not growing faster then the industry. This is a reflection of the economy, slowing spend, and our credit actions.  And also note that travel sales have slowed significantly from last quarter. Looking now at slide six and revenue growth, GAAP revenue as I mentioned in the bottom right hand corner grew at 3% but on a managed basis, we grew 9%.  Discount revenue grew 5% based on the 8% billed business growth that we saw. Net card fees reflect proprietary card growth and higher average fees per card. Net interest and securitization income decreased 7%. The decline was driven by lower securitization income due to higher credit losses and a write-down in our OI strip. Net interest income increased 13% as higher net interest yields more then offset the lower owned loan balances on the balance sheet.  We will see pressure on yield in the fourth quarter due to current LIBOR levels, which are way off historic relationships to Fed funds. Historically LIBOR has been 20 to 40 basis points above Fed funds. In early October, they were nearly 300 basis points above Fed funds and peaked at 4.59%. This is the one-month LIBOR rate.  So we will be watching this closely and the relationship between LIBOR and Fed funds. Fortunately, today LIBOR dropped 43 basis points and now stands at 3.75% and we will continue to watch its direction. Moving to slide seven in terms of metrics within USCS, here billed business grew at 4%, down from 6% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. Small business growth has been higher then consumer throughout 2008. We continue to acquire card members with positive economics and we encourage credit worthy card members to spend but we are managing small business spending very closely. Credit operations is limiting or stopping spending on customers with high probability of default. We continue to selectively invest in US consumer and small business and grew cards in force 4%. Card member loans you can see we securitized about 35% of loans as of the third quarter of 2007. We have historically securitized less loans then our competitors so we had the capacity to do more securitizations in the period of stress and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done this year. As we\u2019ll discuss later approximately 50% of our funding was unsecured and 50% was done through securitization. Moving to slide eight, metric performance for international consumer, we continue to have strong metrics in international consumer although we did see some slowing in billed business in the third quarter. FX adjusted growth in the first and second quarter was 10% compared to the 8% in the third quarter.  Cards in force growth and average spend growth reflect our investments in charge card and premier lending in certain international markets. Card member loans are well controlled although we did start to see some weakness in credit metrics in Mexico. Slide nine, global corporate services also continues to have very solid metric growth although again here billed business slowed in the third quarter. First and second quarter growth on an FX adjusted basis was about 10% and now we see 7% FX adjusted growth.  Card in force growth and average spend growth are very positive. Although travel sales of 14% compare with 17% growth in the second quarter, again reflecting the slowing economy.  Slide 10, global network and merchant services, spending growth of 8% was driven by 7% growth in US retail and everyday categories which represents 70% of US billings and international spend growth.  US T&E spending grew 2%. Global network services continued to have very strong-billed business growth at 29%. Moving to slide 11, marketing and rewards growth of 7% reflects marketing at similar levels to the third quarter of 2007 and higher rewards cost inline with volume growth.  HR and other operating is up 2%. If we exclude the VISA MasterCard payments which are netted on this line, it grew 10% which reflects investments in sales force as well as investments in certain international consumer markets. Charge card provision while increasing $72 million continues to be well controlled. Lending provision on a GAAP basis is up 65% with higher growth on a managed basis. Both charge and lending reflects the impact of the economy. In a minute I\u2019ll review a number of credit metrics with you, but before I leave this slide you\u2019ll note that the tax rate is 20% which reflects the resolution of certain prior year items, and the benefit of the revision of an estimated in the annual effective tax rate.  Moving to slide 12, the net charge card loss ratio has increased slightly across each of the businesses. Overall the loss rate increased by four basis points. We continue to control spending very thoughtfully, balancing both the short-term and long-term view.  Looking at slide 13 we see the charge card 90-day past due have also moved up slightly across each business. In aggregate past dues have increased 20 basis points, although we are seeing a greater impact on the P&L from our lending portfolio which we\u2019ll look at next.  On slide 14 you can see the net write-off rate. In the second quarter, we indicated to you that the third quarter write-off rate would increase. The US write-off increased 60 basis points compared to the second quarter and in the US is up 290 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2007. This rate is faster then some of our competitors\u2019 growth rates. This is due for three reasons we\u2019ve discussed before. Small business is a higher percentage of our business, and small business has a higher write-off rate although small business continues to be very profitable.  We have a greater concentration in card members and balances in Florida and California because it is a more affluent area, and due to the housing environment, we are seeing higher losses there. In addition, we have historically had faster growth in spending and a consequent faster growth in loans although I\u2019ll point out that in the third quarter we are growing at the same rate as our competitors. In the US while the write-off rate in the quarter was 5.9% the write-off rate in September was 6.1%. We expect the fourth quarter to be higher then the third quarter and we expect the first quarter of 2009 to be higher then the fourth quarter of 2008. International consumer ticked up somewhat primarily driven by credit metrics in Mexico. Moving to slide 15, after only a modest increase in the second quarter US lending managed 30-day past dues increased 60 basis points reflecting both increases in the current to 30-day past dues category and the 30-day to write-off roll rates. Reflecting the inherent risk in the portfolio we increased managed credit reserves by over $250 million. International consumer 30-day past due had a more moderate increase, again largely driven by Mexico. Now let me turn to capital funding and liquidity, on slide 16 you can see our capital ratios. We believe we have historically been very prudent in our approach to capital retention which was very consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong A rating. Let me just speak for a moment about the rating agencies, today Moody\u2019s moved our parent company rating from A1 to A2 and our funding subsidiaries from AA3 to A1. Moody\u2019s previously had our funding subsidiaries a notch above all the other rating agencies.  They also reaffirmed our short-term rating of P1. They have us on negative outlook given the current economic environment and capital markets. This is similar to many other financial institutions. I\u2019d also note that S&T put us on negative outlook in July and we meet with them and other rating agencies periodically to update them on our financial results, capital and liquidity plans. We believe those plans are both thoughtful and will enable us to continue to fund in this difficult environment and our strong capital position provides us with the strength given the environment as well, so a combination of capital funding and liquidity plans we believe put us in good [sted]. Despite the environment we continue to generate capital during these difficult times compared to some others who have taken substantial hits and needed to raise addition capital. We will continue to generate capital and we will continue to forego our share repurchase until business conditions improve. As you can see from the chart our capital ratios improved throughout 2008. We have a well established method with the rating agencies of doing a bottoms up calculation asset by asset to calculate our capital needs and then we keep a layer of surplus on top of that.  In 2008 we are building that surplus to higher levels. I\u2019ll also note related to capital that based on a treasury department clarification issued today, it suggests that we may be eligible for the capital purchase program. We will be reviewing the programs\u2019 details and definitions.    Let me move to slide 17, funding, our goal is to fund ratably over the year. We have been successful at meeting this goal in 2008, funding when many other companies could not although we have paid higher spreads.  As you can see in the chart, we raised $23 billion year-to-date compared to a funding plan of $27 billion. This funding has had a weighted average term of six years, although from a spreads perspective we have paid 165 basis points above one month LIBOR. In recent years we had been paying 20 to 40 basis points above one month LIBOR.  We are also looking to continue to diversify our funding sources. The new retail note program which began in late August has raised $400 million with maturities from three to five yeas. The CD program which started a few weeks ago has raised almost $200 million with maturities ranging from three months to two years.  It is our plan to expand our funding from deposits. Turning to commercial paper we have had full access to at historical levels, at similar prices, although the weighted average maturity has become shorter. In August on a daily basis we funded $745 million, in September on a daily basis $854 million. The average cost during that period was 2.56%.  In October on an average daily basis, we have funded $627 million and the cost has been 2.15%. However similar to other financial institutions long-term unsecured and secured markets have been unavailable since mid September.  Now let me review our liquidity plan which we believe is comprehensive and enables us to meet our funding needs even if we do not have access to commercial paper, unsecured or secured markets. Now looking at slide 18, as you would expect liquidity has been an important focus for us. On October 6 we filed an 8-K outlining the strength of our liquidity plan. More recent announcements by the Federal Reserve further strengthens our position. Let me review with you our funding needs over the next six months, and 12 months and how we plan to utilize liquidity resources if commercial paper, unsecured and secured markets are unavailable. So as you can see on the chart we have a net funding need for commercial paper. Our commercial paper is actually at a higher level but from those issuances we are holding certain levels of cash.  So our net need for the commercial paper is $4 billion, net bank time deposits is $2 billion and we have maturing long-term debt of $12 billion. We would meet those needs by using our liquidity investment portfolio of $5 billion, our conduit facility of $5 billion, as well as the commercial paper funding facility that is available to us.  If we have to fund by 12 months, we would again have requirements of net commercial paper and net time deposits but our maturing long-term debt would be $21 million so we have\u2014let me modify that. So in the first column for six months we have $11 billion and for 12 months in total we would have a funding requirement of $24 billion.  In that case again we\u2019d use our liquidity portfolio, the conduit facility and we\u2019d use the commercial paper funding facility which runs through April. After that we would rely on the temporary liquidity guarantee program where we can access we estimate $8.8 billion and that in combination with the Fed [taps] and discount window would enable us top meet our $24 billion of funding needs.  So the point here is not to demonstrate how it will play out but instead to give you an understanding of the various options we could deploy to ensure that the company can fund during a prolonged period of disruption. Over recent months there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about the effectiveness of wholesale funding model versus the bank deposit model and while we see the merits of building a deposit capability the reality is most people who have substantial deposits are also large capital markets borrowers.  The bottom line is that we believe we are well positioned with capital, funding capabilities and liquidity resources to successfully navigate through this difficult environment.  With that let me conclude with a few final comments, despite the impact that the weakening economic environment has had on our customer spending, credit performance and bottom line this quarter many key business metrics that serve as an indicator of our competitive position continue to perform relatively well.  We see that in our overall bill business and cards in force growth rates, where our performance demonstrates the benefits of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years. These benefits were more visible within our international consumer, global commercial services, and global network and merchant services segments where our volumes in card growth were relatively strong although bill business growth did slow somewhat versus prior quarters. In the US the slowing growth in our managed lending balances is inline with the tempered spending environment that also reflects the proactive credit actions and tighter standards that we\u2019ve implemented this year.  In the quarter despite the decrease in our own loan balances we did increase our loss reserve levels. We believe this action is both appropriate and prudent, positions our reserves to reflect the inherent portfolio risk and our expectations for increased write-off levels which we anticipate will rise further in the next two quarters. Our investment portfolios hold high quality securities and we did not recognize impairments within continuing operations during the third quarter. As you would expect both spending and loan volumes slowed in the latter part of the quarter and into October as increasing stress in financial markets world wide further eroded consumer and business confidence levels.  In addition LIBOR rates have been particularly high in October and will negatively impact our variable debt borrowing costs during the month. LIBOR levels in November and December will be another important factor impacting results in the fourth quarter.  Looking forward its our belief that today\u2019s difficult economic environment will persist well into 2009. We will be impacted by the resulting slowdown in spending as well as continued pressure on write-off rates.  However we believe our business model will be positioned to generate earnings and free equity cash flow that will build capital even in an economic environment that is likely to be the weakest we\u2019ve seen in many years. We also believe we have the capital strength, the funding in place and the liquidity, capacity and flexibility to affectively manage through these difficult market conditions.  In fact our current liquidity resources which have been enhanced by the benefits available through the Fed commercial paper funding facility and temporary liquidity guarantee program, are designed to fund maturing obligations in normal operations for at least 12 months even if capital markets are not available.  We are working to best position the company to withstand the tests that lie ahead. Growth opportunities continue to exist in the marketplace but over the coming quarters we will have to be even more selective with our investment dollars and work to prudently balance near-term performance against long-term profitability and growth. As we\u2019ve indicated before we will be implementing an accelerated reengineering program over the latter part of the year which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter. We expect the benefits of these actions to begin in the first quarter of 2009 and build throughout the year.  In addition we will also be implementing a number of pricing actions which will help mitigate the negative impact of the current credit market and economic environment. The anti trust settlement we reached with VISA MasterCard also provides with a multi year source of income that can help to lessen the impact of the environment and when conditions improve, give us the ability to step up investments in the business. Collectively we believe these factors will position us for the difficult period that lies ahead. While the current economic turmoil has negatively impacted our results, we continue to believe our business model remains strong and that we are positioned to generate returns to provide capital flexibility and strength. We have a strong position within the payments industry, our brand is recognized and respected around the globe, we have shown the ability to adjust to the economic conditions whether it be to implement defensive measures or take advantage of competitive opportunities. Our balance sheet is appropriately positioned with capital funding and liquidity profile that provides flexibilities in these volatile times, and across all our businesses we have instilled a strong focus on the customer, some of who we need to stay close to regardless of the environment.  Our ultimate goal is to ensure that American Express navigates through these conditions in the best position possible relative to our payments competitors, and the overall industry.  Thanks for listening and we are now ready for your questions. \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: The restructuring if you could quantify the charge in the fourth quarter and the outlook for savings benefits into 2009 from the restructuring. \nDaniel Henry : We have not completed all of the work on what programs we are going to institute. Once we do have those plans finalized which we think will be in the near-term within the fourth quarter, we will make an announcement in terms of what the reserve amount would be as well as the anticipated savings that will be generated through the restructuring programs. But we think they will be very important in terms of enabling us to continue to generate earnings and capital in 2009.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: On loan growth, the outlook for growth or shrinkage, in line with that where do you think a peak, its very difficult to say but if you could try to put some gauge around how high you think credit losses could go in 2009, is it 200 basis points above the current levels and if you tie that into loan growth\u2014\nDaniel Henry: I think what you\u2019re seeing is as our spending growth has come down, our loan growth has come down at the same rate which I think is a real positive. I think that helps and is a reflection of both the economy plus the credit actions that we are taking. As that slows it will have a negative effect on the denominator effect of the write-off calculation and as I said, we expect write-offs to increase over the next two quarters but its not our plan to actually forecast exactly how much it will increase. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Can you talk about your deposit business, I take it the retail note program, is it on top of your deposits you already gathered in the June quarter, and just on a broader strategic point, I know you mentioned or alluded to the fact that you don\u2019t think you need to change your business model, but why wouldn\u2019t it make sense to add a broader retail deposit capability at this point given all the assets are out for sale right now?\nDaniel Henry: We would agree with you that it makes sense to diversify our funding sources. I think the note program which raised $400 million since its inception late August and the CD program which raised almost $200 million in just a couple of weeks, is just the beginning of actions that we plan to take to really build a broader deposit base. We think that makes a significant amount of sense and we\u2019re just at the beginnings of that it\u2019ll be a focus of ours over the next year or two. Its something that will take time to build but we think over time it\u2019ll be an important part of our funding base.\nKenneth Chenault : The other point that is important is as we look at payments we are diversified in a major way in payments and if we look at how we\u2019ve been able to build out B2B which has a lower credit risk, I think we have been able to demonstrate that there are some very attractive growth opportunities with a lower risk profile. What I also think is important is as we look at becoming if you will a retail bank, we think there are other things that go with that, that concern us and we think that what\u2019s critical is that we have a diversity of our business model from a deposit standpoint, we are focused on making progress there through the programs that Daniel went through. But what I think is important to understand is the diversity that we have in our payments business model. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: What exactly do you mean by net CP, why do you issue CP and then just stick it in cash, and then are the trust metrics for the lending portfolio effected by the delinquency rate methodology change?\nDaniel Henry: As part of our liquidity plan we hold cash which is very important to us because to the extent other sources aren\u2019t available to us we want to have sufficient cash so that we can bridge over into selling our treasuries that are part of our liquidity program or bridge into the financing conduit. So its really just to give us the flexibility in the short-term to start to utilize the other facilities that we have in place that\u2019s the reason that we hold cash.  In terms of does the change impact the trust, the answer to that is no. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Is on the current basis, or its on the old basis.\nDaniel Henry: No, the trust is done consistent with the new basis which is applying to the older balance where there was the collections that come in after the cycle date. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: Okay so the change you made, just made it consistent with the trust/\nDaniel Henry: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Could you elaborate on the pricing changes you mentioned and regarding the spending behavior you\u2019re seeing, you alluded to spend shift in the states from toward more commodity driven everyday type spending, do you think that you\u2019re losing spending from your good clients to existing debit cards in their wallet because of the type of spending that a lot of their funds are going toward now? \nDaniel Henry: The pricing changes given the environment that we\u2019re facing, we will put pricing changes in. It will be broad based. It\u2019ll be surgical to certain portions of the portfolio but we\u2019ll be putting in some pricing changes that will increase APRs for certain customers by 200 or 300 basis points. We think its prudent given the nature of those products and the economic environment that we face. As it relates to spending behaviors I think for many years we\u2019ve been focused on shifting more and more spend to the everyday category. We think that has been part of what\u2019s enabled us to continue to take market share in the US and certain markets internationally. We\u2019re going to continue to push into those areas because we think its beneficial to the long-term health of the franchise. \nKenneth Chenault : I think that certainly what we have seen from the major issuers would suggest that we are continuing to have a very strong position with the affluent customer and we have not seen signs of debit encroaching on share in those categories.\nDaniel Henry: Even though our spending did slow compared to prior quarters our spend was still stronger then the competition so it would appear that we\u2019re continuing to take market share. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities: Are you doing anything on the merchant or the issuing bank side in terms of your pricing, whether its discount rate related or cross border fees related or --?\nDaniel Henry: We continue on the merchant side to price based on value and as you\u2019re aware our discount rate would normally fall by 200 or 300 basis points a year as we push into the more everyday spend categories. But because we bring value to certain categories we\u2019ve gone back to them and repriced so we will continue to use the same philosophy of pricing based on value with our merchants. \nKenneth Chenault : I think at the end of the day, merchants are very focused on driving volume and we have programs that can help them drive that volume in their places of business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: On the higher LIBOR rates, how much of your funding is variable rate and subject to LIBOR impacts?\nDaniel Henry: About 70% is currently variable rates.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: So basically that\u2019s how we should think about the impact in aggregate from a margin standpoint right?\nDaniel Henry: There\u2019s two impacts, one is the extent LIBOR is just higher it effects all of our funding but its particularly important as it relates to our variable price products because there we\u2019re looking for a normal spread between prime and LIBOR which has historically been about 270 basis points. To the extent there\u2019s compression on that spread that will affect our profitability and our margins as well.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: How much of your assets are variable rate?\nDaniel Henry: Of our loans about 60% are variably priced. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: On this temporary liquidity guarantee program, when does it actually kick in and this subject to meeting the criteria for participation, have you looked into it, you do qualify right.\nDaniel Henry: We do qualify. I think there\u2019s still a lot of learnings to be had on exactly how the program will work. What we\u2019ve done is looked and seen that of our unsecured debt between September 30 of 2008 through June 30 of 2009 we estimate that $8.8 billion will mature and qualify for this program. There may be some other aspects that potentially qualify but based on our reading we feel pretty certain that the $8.8 billion will be qualifying for the guarantee. I think they have to administratively get the program up and running. The commercial paper program they\u2019ve had discussions with a number of people including ourselves and they\u2019re actually going to have registration for the commercial paper program starting I think on the 27th of October and then I think shortly thereafter people will be able to access it. I don\u2019t know the exact timing when we\u2019ll be able to benefit from the liquidity guarantee program. I think that\u2019s all in the process of evolving. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Is there a P&L impact from the charge-off rate disclosure change or were you always suppressing revenues?\nDaniel Henry: There\u2019s no impact on the P&L. Its really just a matter of what line item it flows through on the P&L and regardless of what line item it flows through its really just a matter of what people include in this write-off calculation. So we happen to be including principal, interest and fees and other people were only including principal. So it has no impact on the bottom line of our income statement. It just makes it easier to compare. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: In the quarter was there any effect from increasing the amount of loans that you securitized on provisioning or is that a longer-term effect?\nDaniel Henry: When we do securitizations when you look at the GAAP P&L we would be putting up reserves on the GAAP P&L for all owned loans that are on our books and the impact of credit for the piece that\u2019s securitized is running through securitization income which has always been the case. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: I just trying to think about what you show as the loss provision, if you securitize more then the loss provision in the current period would be somewhat less.\nDaniel Henry: Yes, on the GAAP basis, that\u2019s right. But we also in the press release attachments, give you what the provision would be on a managed basis so you can look at it either on a GAAP basis or use the material in the attachment to do a calculation of what it would it be on a managed basis.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Regarding the change in LIBOR how much of the $100 million was related to interest expense and how much was credit and--?\nDaniel Henry: I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve broken that out, I think its both a combination of interest and credit but I would say the credit is the thing that has the greatest impact on the IO strip.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: In terms of sensitivity to LIBOR remaining elevated relative to Fed funds there\u2019s not much IO left so if you didn\u2019t have another adjustment on credit, there\u2019s not that much more to take as a write down is there?\nDaniel Henry: The IO strip now stands at $37 million.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Could you provide some color on the increase in the charge card [boss] ratios and the [inaudible] rates and how much of that is small business and how much is consumer and what\u2019s going on this cycle relative to 2002 or 1992 in terms of the deterioration you\u2019re seeing.\nDaniel Henry: Yes we did see a tick up this quarter. We saw a very modest increase in provision in the second quarter\u2014\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: The charge-offs, the year-over-year number, there\u2019s a big increase there.\nDaniel Henry: Its $72 million increase in provision in charge card but when you really look at our total company, our total business the real impact is coming from lending. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Historically your charge card business has had lower loss rates and its quite low and international I guess even with Mexico and in corporate, the ratio is showing pretty significant uptick, are you seeing that in consumers or small business or--?\nKenneth Chenault : But the point is we have been at historical lows, we\u2019re coming off historical lows on charge card. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: So is it small business that\u2019s accounting for most of that or --?\nDaniel Henry: I think it\u2019s a combination of both, I think we historically have had and currently have higher loss rates on our small business portfolio then we have on consumer but quite frankly both of them have moved up at relatively similar rates so there\u2019s no unusual disproportionate impact from small business.\nKenneth Chenault : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a major difference in the rate movement relative to small business and consumer but we\u2019ve seen some obviously worsening. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce \u2013 Merrill Lynch\nKen Bruce \u2013 Merrill Lynch: I understand you don\u2019t want to be over reactive to the current market environment, but I\u2019d like to understand your pricing strategy in terms of having surgical price increases on certain parts or certain products within the franchise is certainly understandable, but it looks like the funding pressure is going to be much more broad based and is going to have a significant compression in margins overall. How are you going to balance between the pressure you\u2019re seeing on the funding side of the business with only limited pricing power or willingness to re price and how you\u2019re going to balance that for overall profitability.\nDaniel Henry: The funding pressure is going to come certainly if the markets stayed frozen for a protracted period and LIBOR stayed up, it would put tremendous pressure. I think all the actions that the government is taking are designed to help pull off the freeze that we see in the markets. If that happens it would be logical to expect that LIBOR would start to come down.  Last week it was pretty stubborn and only came down a limited amount, but today we saw a pretty big drop in the one-month LIBOR rate, it was 42 basis points. So you\u2019re right if it stayed at these levels that would put tremendous pressure. I would say its my expectation that its not going to go back to the 24, 40 basis points above Fed funds but it\u2019ll improve significantly from here.  The other thing I would say is the pricing is only a portion of our reengineering. So our reengineering also has elements that are looking at costs whether they be the structure that we have currently in terms of our employee contingent or whether its looking at processes so we\u2019re going to obtain some benefit in reengineering from pricing but also a very significant benefit from the other actions that we\u2019re going to take on the cost side.\nKenneth Chenault : I think there\u2019s a strong focus on expenses and we also believe that there are opportunities to shift more volume from off line to online and we think there are adjustments that we can make in our expense structure not just to deal with 2009 but in fact to have a business model that allows us to compete in a more effective way on a multi year basis. But this is not just a situation that we\u2019re focused on revenues, and making changes relative to pricing, but we in fact have gone through an extensive exercise as far as our expenses are concerned.\nKen Bruce \u2013 Merrill Lynch: And that\u2019s the piece that you\u2019ll be taking to fourth quarter and providing some addition clarity around?\nKenneth Chenault : Yes, absolutely. \nKen Bruce \u2013 Merrill Lynch: I can under the reaction to LIBOR but spreads are obviously wide as well, how much of the liquidity backstops in terms of the ABS conduit facility and commercial paper funding facility, is that pricing already established or is that something you\u2019re going to have to go to an at market type financing relative to LIBOR as well as spreads and what\u2019s your big picture economic backdrop that you\u2019ve got in your own forecast particularly as it relates to unemployment here in the US?\nDaniel Henry: On the funding side based on our understanding for commercial paper, three month paper what we can estimate the pricing would be would be about what we would pay today for three-month paper so we think on the commercial paper side it will be competitive. Within the liquidity guarantee we\u2019ll have to see what the market prices are for R rating with a government guarantee and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really played out yet but I would think that those are going to be at market prices and we\u2019ll have to see how it evolves but I don\u2019t think there will be any steep premium there in either case. There is a small fee related to participating in the commercial paper market but its relatively modest. Switching over to economic outlook and unemployment, our assumption as we do our planning for next year is that unemployment will increase reasonably substantially in 2009 and we\u2019re reflecting that in our thinking in terms of where we think credit losses will be and where billings level will be and that, I might call pessimistic but probably realistic view of where the economy will be is what caused us as a management team to decide that it was appropriate to do reengineering so that we can as Kenneth said both deal with the short-term but also position ourselves well for when the economy improves. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital\nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital: Can you give us an update on the ABS market and any plans to try to tap that in the fourth quarter and then when I look at the long-term funding and the American Express bank FSB and Centurion Bank, can you remind us what charters you have there and as part of restructuring when you talk about that, is that inclusive of debt restructuring? You said you don\u2019t need a retail bank but just if you could remind us how flexible are those bank charters and the ability to continue to fund longer term through those and at what cost.\nDaniel Henry: Since mid September I think we did an issuance in the second week of September, I don\u2019t think in the last four weeks any major financial institution has done any long-term funding. I think maybe Caterpillar did a small offering somewhere in late September but basically both the secured and unsecured markets are frozen and unavailable to either us or anyone else in financial services. No one has ventured into those markets. Certainly I think many people are hopeful that the actions that the government is taking are designed to directly help thaw that freeze and if the markets are open we will access those markets.  I think you could look in the early part of 2008 when many people were not able to fund, we were and we funded ratably over the quarters based on our funding plan even though we needed to pay up in terms of spread. So if the markets open we think we\u2019ll be one of the first people who have access and we will access them. In terms of our banks charters, we have an ILC in Utah which we\u2019ve had for many years. We also have a Federal Savings Bank, FSB, so those are our two banks. The FDIC regulates the ILC in Utah and the OTS regulates the Federal Savings Bank. Both are well-established institutions that have been with us for some time that enables us to fund our loan book. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Kevin Stera] \u2013 Sanford, Bernstein\n[Kevin Stera] \u2013 Sanford, Bernstein: The ongoing credit crisis continues to move in unpredictable ways and I was hoping you could give specific examples about how you\u2019re responding differently during this economic downturn then you might have in previous ones.\nDaniel Henry: I think our sophistication as a company is certainly light years better then it was in the early 90s and is substantially more sophisticated today then it was in 2001. Each downturn is different in nature and this downturn has had a lot to do with housing so we have substantially improved our ability to integrate housing date whether it be who you have your mortgage with or what geography you live in are things that we have built in to credit scoring.  We also look at what industry you\u2019re in so if you\u2019re in an industry that\u2019s healthier we may deal with you in a different way then if you\u2019re in an industry such as construction that is being impacted to a greater degree. We also obviously use all information that\u2019s available to us at credit bureaus so we are very focused on not only what type of utilization you have on your line with us but the what you have with other institutions. From there we can see whether you are seeking additional credit so we look to integrate as many factors as we can and what we found is depending on the type of product you have, the level of spending you have, it could be different factors which are the most important to look at to help predict the probability of default. Se we have very sophisticated models that are building in current information on a continuous basis but we are also keenly aware of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and building that into the decision at the same time.  And we are trying to balance the short-term in terms of what our credit losses are but we are also very focused on the long-term and we want to interact with our customers in a way so that we don\u2019t turn away customers who will be excellent profitable customers in the long-term. We\u2019re trying to work that delicate balance. \nKenneth Chenault : One of the important things is the micro segmentation that we are engaged in. I think in the early 90s we were new to the lending business with Optima, we had a very limited product. If you look at how we\u2019ve been able to diversify our product line and also the fact that we have particularly in the US dramatically expanded our merchant coverage. So you had a situation in the early 90s that because of the limited merchant acceptance and the fact that we had a limited product line, we did not necessarily get some of the best customers.  Now the value propositions have substantially improved. We have improved our merchant coverage. The competitive positioning of our products is quite strong and I think that that helps us in this environment. But I think what\u2019s critical is with the range of products and customer segments that we have is to take all that Daniel said and really then to bring it down to a micro segment level so that we are not just putting in actions that cover the entire card base. We\u2019re really focused on micro segmentation. \n[Kevin Stera] \u2013 Sanford, Bernstein: On page five of your slide deck you show managed card member loans up 5% and owned loans down 9% year-over-year, could you walk through the economics of what determined that distinction in those growth rates?\nDaniel Henry : The managed growth is the growth of our entire portfolio, 5% which is very consistent with our growth in spending. The owned amount is managed loans less what we\u2019ve securitized so we have securitized more receivables in 2008 and as a result its actually causing owned loans to be lower this year then last year. So the managed number is reflective of the entire business, the owned is just a matter of the fact that we\u2019ve done more securitization during 2008 because its what was available that\u2019s causing owned loan growth to be down.  From an economic point of view whether receivables are owned or securitized, 100% of the economics related to those loans accrue to American Express. So on an economic basis there is effectively no difference between the owned and managed loans.\n[Kevin Stera] \u2013 Sanford, Bernstein: Could you talk about what the factors were that led you to securitize the larger fraction and why that was in your best interest in this scenario, in this environment.\nDaniel Henry: For many years many of our competitors have securitized at much higher levels. We have always decided to keep our securitization levels down around 35%. The reason for that is that we thought in stress situations secured lending would be more available at better prices then unsecured lending. So now we are in a stress situation and so we decided to execute against that basic plan and avail ourselves of the fact that we had more capacity to do securitizations so this year instead of doing one-third securitization and two-thirds unsecured, we did it 50-50.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey \nScott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey : Just referring to slide 18, the liquidity update, how much flexibility is there in determining, next six months, 12 months, but how much control do you have over the demand that you\u2019ll have for liquidity, if utilization rates go up on credit cards or for some reason spending goes up, etc. how much control do you have over the amount of liquidity you have to fund over the next six and 12 months?\nDaniel Henry: We obviously can control through authorizations and by bringing in new card members what our volumes would be. Certainly we will continue to invest and we want to continue to bring in card members where we\u2019ll have good economic returns. That obviously will be calibrated based on what\u2019s taking in the environment. If its more robust we\u2019ll want to invest. If the economy slows down we want to make sure that we\u2019re making investments that are getting the proper returns and therefore may moderate our investments. What you see here is what we need to meet the maturities that we have on the balance sheet. To the extent we are having good spend growth and good loan growth then I think in all likelihood in that situation there\u2019s going to be access to the credit market.\nKenneth Chenault : I think if we\u2019re going to have good spend growth it would mean that the overall economic environment is improving. \nDaniel Henry: To your point that you could have greater utilization on lines, but as we\u2019ve discussed we are very focused on line size. In the past year we have had many more reductions in line size then we have in the past and the number of line increases have been more moderate so we think we are being very active and thoughtful about how we\u2019re controlling spending and therefore loan balances. We really have not seen any change in pay down rates which is another thing that could it. We think that we have the ability to calibrate our business based on the environment and wouldn\u2019t see that causing any undue stress beyond the funding needs that you see on slide 18.\nScott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey : Regarding capital, prudently you\u2019ve let the capital ratio rise as the environment has gotten worse, do you see a level where you feel comfortable that you have enough capital and you\u2019ll begin returning more capital to shareholders?\nDaniel Henry: I think we have sufficient capital today however given that the economy is slowing we will continue to retain capital quite frankly until we see the economy turn and at that point I think we\u2019ll go back to a process where we\u2019ll be returning capital to shareholders. We haven\u2019t changed our 65% on average and over time target. For many years when we were in a robust environment we were returning more then 65%. So in a period of stress of slowdown, we\u2019ll return less then 65% but on average and over time we have not decided to change that 65% target.\nKenneth Chenault : In this economic environment we want to be cautious. \nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: On the tax rate, in this type of environment US card is the business that\u2019s under the most stress, what would be a reasonable tax rate? \nDaniel Henry: We\u2019ve said that around 30%-ish is in normal circumstances would be a tax rate to think about. Since the US has the highest tax rate within our mix to the extent earnings there are lower, we\u2019ll see an impact. You shouldn\u2019t be thinking about 20% though, it\u2019ll be something lower then 30%, but I wouldn\u2019t give you a precise calculation.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Your marketing spend was, you talked about in the past in a tough environment to pull back on is marketing spend, but the marketing spend was stronger then I thought it might be this quarter. Could you give some feel for that. Are you pulling back some levers on marketing spend given your outlook?\nDaniel Henry: I would point out the vast majority of the 7% increase that we saw in the quarter on the marketing was coming from rewards. Marketing we held flat to 2007 levels. We thought there were sufficient opportunities to invest whether it be in our merchant business or in certain markets internationally then it warranted keeping investment levels at a constant level. As we go forward we\u2019ll be calibrating that what amount of marketing that we want to have which will be driven in part by how robust the environment is. We\u2019ll continue to see rewards grow in line with the growth in spending. Our rewards programs are really the thing that power our business and we think it\u2019s a benefit that will help us in whether its robust economy or a slow economy.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: On your net exposure to LIBOR, the net effect on the company from the elevation in LIBOR, if you could go through that once more. \nDaniel Henry: On LIBOR, if rates go up it\u2019ll effect our cost of funds related to charge card where we have no interest rate or as it relates to our fixed rate lending products. Fixed rate lending products may up 40% of our loans. If you look at the 60% of loans that are variably priced, we actually want to lock in a spread so whether interest rates go up or down we would be indifferent. We would be looking for that locked in spread.  However that locked in spread is dependent on LIBOR staying with historic levels as it relates to Fed funds. So usually LIBOR has been 20 to 40 basis points above Fed funds. Since we price to our customers off of prime and prime is driven by Fed funds, to the extent LIBOR increases beyond that historic level that creates compression on our spread and it will effect our P&L. So its very important for us to have LIBOR at those historic relationships. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: So its 100% of the fundings against the charge card\u2014\nDaniel Henry: You also have to take into consideration that 30% of our funding is fixed rate and you also have to consider that we don\u2019t fund receivables from charge or loans from lending products 100% with debt. Part of it is funded with capital and part is funded with non-interest bearing liabilities that we have on our books like the rewards liability. You have to factor all those aspects in in terms of calculating the impact. \nOperator: Your final question is a follow-up from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: On the tax rate, from the deposit gathering franchisers standpoint, would you consider the right acquisition opportunity if it was present to you and are you actively looking for anything?\nKenneth Chenault : I think the reality and my position has been pretty consistent here. If an acquisition will accelerate our progress and improve our business model, we\u2019re open to it. But I think the important thing about the focus on retail deposits, is it also comes with a lot of other stuff and the question is what are the economics, what\u2019s the growth going forward and how are we positioned relative to the other opportunities we have to generate growth?  And what we think is that we are evolving a funding strategy that will allow us to navigate through these challenging times and we also think the way we have diversified the company to increasingly build our business in those areas that are not as reliant on credit balance the company\u2019s growth and risk as we go forward. And so what I think what is important and I often give this example in the company, is to do a deal where in fact 10% of that deal is going to have an impact on your business and 90% of it is really not core to driving it and the economics are not that good, we have to be very careful. So my point is that we\u2019re open to a range of opportunities but what I\u2019m going to be very focused on is will it generate the type of economics we need to drive our company and will it in fact accelerate our growth. \n :\nDaniel Henry: Thanks everybody for joining the call and take care."}, {"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 2, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-07-21 23:07:08", "content": "Executives:  Ron Stovall \u2013 Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Kenneth Chenault \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Daniel T.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Stovall. \nRon Stovall : We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s discussion. As usual it\u2019s my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  In the second quarter 2008 earnings release, supplement and presentation slides which are now posted on our website at ir.AmericanExpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Ken Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Express will provide some brief opening comments addressing today\u2019s announcement and the current environment. Then Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will the key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides provided and then conclude with summary remarks.  Once he completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where both Ken and Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.\nKenneth Chenault:  My comments will be brief. Over the past month or so we have seen clear signs that the U.S. economy is weakening. Unemployment rates, as we know, took the largest jump in over 20 years. Home prices declined at the fastest rate in decades and consumer confidence is at one of the all time low points.  Now Card member spending particularly among consumers slowed sharply during the latter part of the quarter. Current indicators, as we signaled a few weeks ago, deteriorated beyond our expectations and by almost any measure the U.S. economy and business environment are much weaker than the assumptions we first spoke to you about back in January and the conditions that existed until June.  This fallout was evident across all of our consumer segments even our longer-term super prime card members. While we are obviously disappointed with the bottom line results, adding to our reserves this quarter translates into coverage levels that are substantially higher than at any point during the last two years.  Yet despite this challenging environment our revenue growth for the quarter was solid and our business metrics, that is billings and card growth, were strong. Now as you have seen from some of the earnings releases from financial services this quarter we have been able to generate substantial returns relative to other companies. But having said that, we do not expect to meet or exceed our long-term financial targets until we see improvements in the economy.  Now given the environment we will continue to scale back some card acquisition efforts and reduce credit line selectively in the U.S. At the same time, however, we also plan to take advantage of growth opportunities particularly in international and in the business-to-business markets. Our goal is to stay focused on profitable market share. I believe we have the strength and resources to do just that.  We obviously do not know the extent of the current downturn but the position of our company today is financially sound and competitively strong. We have lowered our risk profile by divesting a number of businesses in recent years and we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that balances our short, medium and long-term objectives.  Now as usual, Dan is going to review the major items and trends during the quarter. He will also offer some additional summary and help with comments. In light of the business and economic environment as Ron said I am going to join him for the follow-up discussion and we will be glad to take any of your questions.  With that let me turn it over to Dan. \nDaniel Henry: As Ron indicated, we are using slides today to facilitate the review of the results. If you don\u2019t have those you can find them at the company\u2019s IR website. Let me start with Slide 2, a summary of financial performance.  You can see that revenues grew 8% and in a few slides I will talk about what that is on a managed basis. Income came in at $655 million and EPS at $0.56. This reflects strong performance in the international consumer, global commercial card and networking merchant services businesses offset in part by higher credit losses in U.S. card services. I\u2019ll speak about that more as we proceed.  Despite the higher credit losses we earned in excess of $600 million and ROE remained strong. Looking at slide 3 we have identified the significant items. First is the addition to the lending credit reserves, $374 million after tax or $600 million pre-tax. This is a result of higher write offs and deterioration of loan rates that we saw in June and reflect the inherent risk in the portfolio and higher anticipated write offs in the balance of the year.  Second is an adjustment to the interest only strip. The interest only strip relates to our securitized loans. The $85 million after tax or $136 million pre-tax is a write down in value also related to the high credit losses we are experiencing. The tax benefit relates to the settlement of prior year items with both the IRS and certain states.  Looking now at Slide 4, capital generation, you can see we generated $756 million at the combination of income in the period as well as funds received related to either option or RSA activity. You can see that we had no share repurchases in the quarter. That is a decision we made early in the second quarter given the economic uncertainty. Going forward we will make decisions about share repurchases based on the economic conditions and company performance quarter by quarter? We are committed to maintaining a strong capital position.  Slide 5: Metric Performance. Metrics are a key measure of the health of the business. Second quarter metrics performed very well and are excellent compared to our competitors. Business-to-business grew 12% or 10% on an FX adjusted basis, down only 100 basis points from the first quarter. Cards in force increased by 10% reflecting investments in our proprietary business and growth in G&S cards. Global growth moderated to 12% down from 19% in the first quarter based on a slow down in consumer spending and travel sales remained very positive.  Slide 6: Revenue Performance. As I mentioned, revenues grew at 8% on a GAAP basis. As you can see, interest and securitization income actually decreased by 7% which reflects the higher credit losses. On a managed basis, revenues increased 12%. Card fee growth was very strong and reflects our customers\u2019 recognition of the value proposition of our products. Other revenue reflects the corporate purchase of the GE Commercial Portfolio which helped that growth rate by about 600 basis points.  Now turning to the segments, if you look at Slide 7, U.S. consumer services. U.S. Consumer Services billed business grew 6% down from 8% in the first quarter. Small business or opened held up very well at 11%. However, consumer continues to decline as we proceeded through the quarter. Cards in force growth are down slightly as we shifted some investment to the international consumer segment. Average spend was flat reflecting the economy and its impact on spending. Loan growth again slowed in this segment linked to the slowdown in spending.  Moving to Slide 8, here is a little bit more detail on the U.S. Consumer Services Billed business. It shows you the monthly trends. You will recall we saw a drop in spending in December. March\u2019s results are depressed and April\u2019s numbers are inflated based on where Easter fell in each respective year. Easter in 2007 was in April and in 2008 it was in March. You can clearly see the drop in May and again in June driven by the slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Moving now to Slide 9, International Consumer Services. On the other hand, International Consumer Services billed business held up very well increasing 20% or 10% on an FX adjusted basis, the same growth as we saw in the first quarter. Card acquisition focused on the premier sector as you can see that average spend grew by 17%. Card member loans grew volume and travel sales were strong.  Moving to Slide 10, Global Commercial Services had a very strong quarter. Billed business grew at 14% or 10% on an FX adjusted basis, again the same growth rate we saw in the first quarter. Cards in force and average spend growth was also very solid in this segment.  Moving to Slide 11, Global Network and Merchant Services, we see strong billed business growth outside the U.S. and I\u2019ll also note that the U.S. retail and everyday spending grew at 9% and that category represents 69% of our U.S. billings. The discount rate held up very well only down 1% year-over-year and G&S, billed business and cards in force growth continues to be very impressive.  Moving to Slide 12, Expense and Provision performance, total expense increased 6% and was very well controlled. Marketing and promotion spending was comparable with the second quarter of 2007. Rewards expense grew with volume. HR and other included increased investment in our merchant sales force. Charge card provision grew modestly which reflects the lower U.S. consumer spending as well as credit actions. The lending provision increased significantly and I will address that over the next few slides. The tax rate of 14% includes the $101 million significant item I mentioned earlier. Without that the tax rate would have been approximately 28%.  Moving to Slide 13, focusing first on charge card net loss ratios, you can see that international consumer and the global commercial services remain very stable and I assure you we are monitoring this very closely. The U.S. consumer services group in the first quarter reflects a seasonal event largely and also to a larger extent the impact of 2008 slowing billings. So this calculation is the write-offs in the quarter which relate to accounts that went past due in the third quarter of 2007 when billings were very strong and at that time we set up appropriate reserves for those past-due\u2019s.  Therefore their write-offs are not having a significant impact in the second quarter of 2008. That is divided by average billings for the past three months, April, May and June, where we had weaker billings. So the 44 basis points you see there in part has to do with the seasonal effect but more than that with the time that we actually set up reserves related to accounts that were past due in the third quarter.  Moving to Slide 14, charge card name to days past due, again you can see that international consumer and global commercial services are very stable and U.S. consumer services are actually improving which is common on a seasonal basis and is also based on the credit actions we are taking.  Moving to Slide 15, lending managed net write off rate, this is where we are seeing the significant negative impact in the P&L. Let me start by reminding you the way we report write-offs is different than the rest of the industry. The rest of the industry includes in write-offs principal only. We include principal, interest and fees. So for the U.S. consumer services we have reflected on the dotted line what our reported write off rate is and we have also noted what it is excluding interest and fees.  It is our intent in either the third or fourth quarter to move to the industry schedule. If you need comparison between our write off rates and the industry the 3.5% is the correct number to use. Let me just mention for a moment as you can see international consumer continues to be very stable and down from 2007. In June write-offs increased beyond our expectations and you can see that on the next slide.  Slide 16, here what we have done is provided low fee write off rates. We provided both the reported numbers and the numbers comparable to our competitors. As we indicated in the first quarter March was high in the average for the quarter and at the end of the first quarter we also indicated second quarter write-offs were going to be higher than first quarter. April and May were in line or slightly above our forecast but June increased well above our expectations.  Turning to Slide 17 we see lending managed 30-day past due\u2019s. You can see that international is stable. The U.S. number is also consistent with the first quarter however roll rates deteriorated significantly in the second quarter in particular in June. Roll rates are the amount that move from current to 30, 30 to 60 and when roll rates increase it is an indicator of what is going to take place in the future and why we are anticipating higher write-offs in the balance of the year.  If you move to Slide 18 here we have included monthly innovation on our roll rates. The top chart is roll rates current to 30 days past due. The bottom chart is 30 days past due to write off. The first quarter if you look at the bottom chart, the 30 days to write off, you can see that while the first quarter is higher than the fourth quarter February and March were below January levels. If you look at the current to 30 you can see that it was improving in February and March. If we move to the second quarter the 30 day to write off number while it increased in April it improved in May.  Again if you go to the top chart and look at current to 30 you can see that April and May were improving. For these reasons we felt we were on track through May. However that changed in June. You can see in the top chart that the current to 30 increased and the 30 day to write off increased sharply. As a result in the second quarter the 30 to write off percentage increased by over 200 basis points compared to the first quarter. These higher roll rates will lead to higher write-offs in the third and fourth quarter.  If you move to Slide 19, this is U.S. consumer services managed 30 day past due by tenure. Now as you can see from this chart the 24-36 and the 36-48 buckets are growing at a faster rate than the overall portfolio. However, all tenures are increasing including the 48+ group. Here we believe the economy is affecting all tenures not just the recent accounts that we have put on the books.  If you move to Slide 20 now and let me take a little time to explain this chart, on the right you see the origination year which means the year a card member joined the American Express franchise. The time period are months across the bottom rank card member history with us in a 12 month time period. The respective plots are the write off rates for each year of origination as the group\u2019s season through the normal curve. If you follow 2001, which is the red line, write-offs increased in the 13-24 months and 25-36 month buckets but then improved.  Now for all years 2003 and newer, the last two plot points are impacted by 2008 credit deterioration. For card members who joined us in 2003 in January through June they would be in the 61 month and greater bucket. Card members that joined July through December would be in the 48-60 month buckets. So as you can see for all years, 2003 through 2007 have been impacted by the 2008 economy.  So if you follow the chart across first you have blue which was 2003. You can see the last two plot points increased. Orange is 2004 and the last two plot points increased. That is true for 2005 and 2006 as well. So the higher than normal last two plot points for 2006 and 2007 are due to the economy. All tenures are being impacted.  The recent vintages, even if we experience higher write-offs for two years, these investments still have very strong economic returns.  Now let\u2019s go to Slide 21. We have shown this chart to you before and it shows that FICO scores have not deteriorated. We don\u2019t use FICO scores to do our acquisitions, we use our proprietary models. But this is an indicator we have not dropped our credit quality over the past several years.  Let me now make a few summary comments. Despite the significant impact that the weakening U.S. economic environment has had on our credit performance and bottom line this quarter most of the key business metrics that serve as a long-term indicator of our competitive strength has performed well. We see that the overall billed business and cards in force growth rate where the gap between our performance and that of most major competitors demonstrate the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our marketing and rewards investment over the past several years.  Once again we benefit from the strong performance within our international consumer, global commercial services and global network and merchant services segments. The performance of these parts of the franchise reflect the benefits of the diversity of our business activities and the balance they provide within our results.  Unfortunately the revenue growth from these relatively strong results was more than offset from credit deterioration within the U.S. The severe decline in home prices and the marked rise in oil prices have had a fundamental impact on consumer budgets and behavior not just as it relates to mortgages and home related spending but also across the full spectrum of the consumer economy.  We saw the first signs of weakness in our credit indicators at the end of last year and communicated this to you in January when we reported our fourth quarter results. At that time we took a credit related charge in order to recognize the deterioration by strengthening our lending and charge card reserve curve ratios and levels.  In the first quarter U.S. lending write off rates rose further and at that time we indicated the second quarter loan loss rate would be higher than the first quarter which has proven to be the case. In April and May U.S. lending write off rates were generally consistent with the 4-6% EPS growth plan that we discussed with you in early June. However, as I showed you on the slide passage we saw credit deteriorate in June beyond our expectations as the write off rates rose and roll rates within the portfolio deteriorated versus prior months.  In other words, more and more consumers who are falling behind on their payments are remaining delinquent. This causes us to assume that a greater percentage of past due loans will not be repaid. In light of the magnitude of the negative economic trends and our experience now we believe the economic weakness in the U.S. will likely worsen throughout the remainder of the year and negatively impact credit and business strategies.  Therefore it was appropriate for us to further strengthen our lending reserves and reduce the fair value of our IO strip. This quarter reserve addition results in a coverage ratio of 135% of past due owned loans which is substantially above the coverage levels over the last three years. We believe this elevated coverage is appropriate in light of the continuing economic uncertainty before us, the inherent risk in our portfolio and the higher write off levels we expect.  As we discussed at the beginning of June, our 4-6% EPS growth forecast assumed an economic environment consistent with what we experienced throughout the first five months of the year. We indicated then that if the economic environment weakened further achieving these results would be difficult. The environment has clearly weakened significantly since then.  Given the credit deterioration we experienced in June and the continued moderation in U.S. volume growth as well as our outlook for continued weakness in the economy we are no longer tracking to this forecast. In addition we now expect that our lending write off rate in the third and fourth quarter will be higher than June levels.  As we move forward we will continue to be guided by our long-term, on average, over time financial objectives. Since we set our target in 1993 we have generally performed consistent with those goals and in fact have outperformed them in recent years. The ultimate goal is to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging conditions in the best position possible relative to our payment competitors and relative to the overall industry.  Growth opportunities continue to exist in the marketplace but over the coming quarters we will be even more selective with our investment dollars moving them to areas of current opportunity as we work to prudently balance near-term performance against long-term profitability and growth. Throughout this decade re-engineering has resulted in a well controlled operating expense base but in light of our desire to maximize our ability to invest in the business we are further intensifying our re-engineering efforts with an eye towards reducing cost structure and staffing levels.  While we have not yet quantified the impact of these activities they will likely result in restructuring charges during the second half of the year. The anti trust settlement we reached with Visa and MasterCard also provides us with multi-year source of funds that can help to lessen the impact of the environment and when conditions improve give us the ability to step up investments in the business.  Collectively we believe these factors will position us to maximize our ability to invest for the long-term. However, these investments coupled with the economic environment will challenge our ability to meet our financial targets until we see improvements in the economy. While we are obviously disappointed with the impact that the current economic turmoil is having on our results the position of the company today is financially sound and competitively strong.  We divested certain businesses such as our international bank and have grown others such as B2B in order to lower our overall risk profile. Our business model has generated particularly attractive returns that provide capital, flexibility and strength. Even with the substantial credit related charges during the quarter we generated in excess of $600 million of earnings.  We have shown our ability to adjust to the environment positions whether it be to implement defensive measures or take advantage of competitive opportunities. Our balance sheet is appropriately positioned. We have access to diversified sources of funding and our cash position and liquidity profile provide us additional protection in these volatile times.  Across all our businesses we will fill a strong focus on the customer, some where we need to stay close to regardless of the environment. Lastly our competitive position is stronger than it has been for decades. We will be impacted by the environment but given the products, customers, geographic breadth of our franchise we believe we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance our short, medium and long-term business and financial goals.  Thanks for listening. We are now ready to take your questions.   \nOperator: (Operator Instructions)Your first question comes from Meredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: You talked about how all segments of the market were impacted from an economic standpoint. You talked about the investor day in January about how certain regions at the time were more impacted than others. Today could you talk about the derivative impact of line reductions? I know you had reduced lines in the high problem real estate areas, the high problem house price depreciation areas. I assume others did as well. What type of impact did that have on consumers? Was there any one catalyst aside from spending that you can attribute the real material increase in charge offs? I\u2019m just looking for anything behavior related that can help us understand what the sudden change was. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think clearly the reduction in line size impacts spending and that has a negative impact on spending. I think what we are certainly trying to do on a geographic basis is to be very, very targeted. What you don\u2019t want to do in this situation is to apply a blunt instrument across the board because we have a number of relationships across tenures and across products that we want to preserve and grow. What we have been able to do is be very, very surgical against those customers that we believe based on our modeling have a higher risk. That is important both not only in setting up the models but making sure we have the right operational controls in place as far as our credit management is concerned. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Is it too soon to tell when your competitors will cut lines to the same customers that you have? I\u2019m really interested in those derivative impacts and the strain that multiple line reductions cause. What are your results in terms of higher defaults? Is it too soon to draw those conclusions yet? \nDaniel Henry:  I think we are continuing to learn as we go through this slow down. Every slow down is different and this has certainly been different than what we have seen in the past and we look to incorporate our learning as we make credit decisions. We continue to see the big significance in geographies where housing prices have fallen the greatest but recently we have actually started to see greater impact in customers who were in that middle cycle band, generally it is customers with low FICO\u2019s where you see the greatest impact and we are certainly seeing it there. We are now seeing it creep into FICO scores of people between 650 and 750.  The other new thing we are seeing is historically if someone had multiple mortgages that was actually a positive factor but in recent months we are starting to see people with multiple mortgages are actually having greater difficulty.  Now to your point about what competitors are doing, we are keeping a close eye and if we identify customers that we have a significantly higher open to buy than our competitors that is another spot where we are seeing added risk and we are reacting to that. So we continue to integrate new lines into our decision but at the same time I want to emphasize we are also being very focused on our care programs. Some customers who are having temporary difficulties would be terrific long-term customers for the franchise and we want to make sure we acknowledge the credit actions we are taking to reduce near-term credit losses with the overall economics of the customer and a customer who could be of great value to us in the future. \nKenneth Chenault:  This is one where we have got to be very, very comprehensive but we\u2019ve got to be surgical and that is where we are really using our modeling and different techniques just to make sure we are focused on targeting those people we think are highest risk and those customers that we can project out and can manage better over the life cycle. We obviously want to continue to retain their business and loyalty. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.:  Can you talk at all about the raise in the charge card business? I was a little bit surprised you didn\u2019t bill provisions there. Are you not seeing the same trends in the charge card business? Also if you could comment on roll rates, particularly late stage roll rates, in the month of July. Do you have any early read on July? Is it as bad as June? \nDaniel Henry:  In the charge card business a lot of the provisioning takes place when the account goes past due. So the people who actually wrote off in the second quarter went past due in the third quarter of last year and that is when the bulk of the provision was set up. We are actually seeing the percentage of customers going past due in the second quarter seasonally is always low but we also in the second quarter of 2008 are seeing the impact of lower spending as well as the impact of our credit adding. So because we don\u2019t see the customers going past due in the second quarter we are not seeing a big pick up in the provision. Therefore provision for the charge cards increased only modestly only 3%. We are very comfortable with how we are handling charge card and where that provision is at this time.  In terms of roll rates you can see what we showed you on the charts and what took place in June. Before that when you combined what we were seeing in the current to 30 roll rates with what we were seeing in the 30 day to write off we were comfortable. But when both of them moved up in June which we hadn\u2019t expected that caused us to be much more cautious about our outlook for the future in terms of evaluating the current risk in our portfolio to set up the reserves. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.: Any early read on July for those kinds of roll rates and also for spending? \nDaniel Henry:  Not at this time. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Co.:  One final question on the lending provision or lending growth. You mentioned the lending put on and balance growth was due to lower volumes. Anything on the marketing side you have done to slow down the lending growth as well? \nDaniel Henry:  I think on the marketing side, marketing spend is obviously for acquisitions which wouldn\u2019t have a quick near term impact on AR growth. It takes a little bit of time for customers to get their card and to spend and move into revolve. We still are marketing at a healthy level across the company. You can see that we spent about the same that we did last year although I will say we have shifted dollars to international and that is helping our spending levels there which are very good. To the extent we spend less on marketing in the U.S. that will have some impact in terms of growth in the U.S. in addition to what is taking place in the economy but we want to shift our investment dollars to the place that has the best current opportunity. We still have very good opportunities in the U.S. as well except we are doing those on a more surgical basis. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think we have got to be and are being more targeted in the U.S. but I would just emphasize the overall opportunities we have in international and B2B, G&S provide very strong growth opportunities and I think it demonstrates the broadness and attractiveness of our business portfolio that we have areas in our business mix that in fact have a more conducive profile to some of the economic issues we are facing and we clearly are re-allocating some investments there. To Dan\u2019s point we are being very targeted and surgical about the investments we are making in the U.S. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Ken a question on market position and strategy of American Express saying you are in a better position than you have been in the history of the company. One area that is clearly going to continue to gain market share not only in the U.S. but globally is the debit card product and I wondered if your thinking is, I know you have done 30-40 projects on debit cards over the years, you are just in a position where you are going to be relegated to a slower growth rate than the peers, the MasterCard and Visa that are large in those products globally. \nKenneth Chenault:  Bob the way I\u2019m going to answer that is I think one way you have to look at what the overall strategic objective is for us in payment. That is obviously to get a greater share of plastic spent against cash and checks. We have a variety of products to do that. As I said a number of times without direct access to a demand deposit account it makes it difficult for us to offer a debit card. However, when one looks at the economics of our charge card products and in fact some of our lending products, we believe that we can meet the functional pay in full spending needs of those customers and prospects through our variety of card products at frankly more attractive economics than we could get with debit.  The other key point where I think we are driving increased penetration is through our B2B products, corporate cards, our middle market products but also G&S. G&S allows us obviously with a very different risk profile and without having credit risk to go after that spending. So I think what you have got to look at is the range of products and what I would emphasize is that despite a very challenging economic environment from a market share standpoint the trends are encouraging relative to our growth overall in the U.S. and certainly when you then add international to that I think we have some very attractive growth prospects.  The point is the credit situation in the U.S. is disappointing but what I would emphasize is if you look at our top line metrics and I think what we have to understand is we are managing this company on average and over time to achieve some financial objectives that we think are ambitious. We have been able to do that historically. This is obviously a tough period right now in the U.S. but I am confident because of our market leading position and the way we have performed even this quarter from a metrics standpoint that the prospects for our card business in the future are in fact strong.  Obviously we need to see some improvements in the economic cycle in the U.S. but when I look at international, B2B and the opportunities in history of our business in the U.S. going through different cycles I do think we are at the strongest competitive position that we have been in a number of years. However, we are dealing in a very challenging economic environment in the U.S. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : On G&S, you have spending growth of 42% but revenue growth of 12% and higher provisions may be in that segment than we would expect over the last couple of quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if the revenue growth and spending growth converge over time and why the provisions are as high as they are in that business. \nDaniel Henry:  The G&S growth at 42% is just a piece of that segment, the global network emerging services segment. That includes both G&S as well as our proprietary business that flowing through this segment. So I think that certainly the growth rate we have seen in G&S which has been absolutely terrific, I think any business to continue at 42% would be difficult but they have done a very nice job of continuing to grow at a very high rate.  The 12% you refer to is all of billed business proprietary and G&S. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : And the provisions? \nDaniel Henry:  So the provisions in G&S I think any time you have a slow down while there are much less impacted by credit losses there is reserves set up within the segment either related to small merchants who could potentially go out of business or large merchant reserves we set up that is required by FIN 45 and so in this quarter we actually saw an impact and we increased that reserve during the quarter primarily to reflect some of the difficulties we see in the airline industry. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Could you provide more color on the contrast between spend behavior and discretionary spending between U.S. charge card customers and how about on slide 20 how do the last few years of charge card customers compare in what you see in the U.S. lending and how does small business compare to that in terms of loss development? \nDaniel Henry:  We don\u2019t provide a break out between charge card and lending products. What we provided you with was what is taking place on spending within the U.S. consumer segment which includes small business as well as consumer charge and lending products. I think as you can see from the charge small business growth in the quarter was 11% compared to 3% on the consumer side so small business is holding up better but on the consumer side we are seeing a greater impact and we are seeing it both on the charge card side and spending on our lending products. So we are seeing that across both those spectrums. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: So you are saying the consumer charge card spending has fallen off greater than consumer lending? \nDaniel Henry:  Consumer lending and charge card are being impacted by the economy and are both seeing the impact of the economy and some overspending by card members. Both card members who have lower FICO scores and card members who have high FICO scores both in card members who carry Blue Card and people who carry a Centurion card. \nKenneth Chenault:  The reality David is that affluent people in fact in some cases are cutting back on discretionary spending. So they are not in the same situation as other segments but the reality is we are seeing very affluent people who have had historically very, very strong spending history with us cutting back on non-discretionary items. They are still very loyal to our product. They are still putting a good percentage of their spending on our products so we don\u2019t believe we are losing share to other products based on our relative billings growth rate but we are seeing affluent customers change some of their spending behavior. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Is the 2% year-over-year growth rate in billed business for USCF a run rate going into the third quarter do you think or do you think there is something funny going on in June and July like there was in March and April with Easter? \nDaniel Henry:  I don\u2019t think there is an impact like Easter in the numbers. I think, as I mentioned there was a downward slope in the quarter and the average was 3% in the quarter but 2% in June so we\u2019ll have to see whether that continues or not. We\u2019ll have to see going forward before we know that. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Could you just clarify the impact of the GE portfolio? Were there cards converted in the quarter? Was there billed business that you recognized from the GE acquisition? I think the other income you refer to is about $60 million of that $150 increase but I\u2019m not sure if there was something else? \nDaniel Henry:  We\u2019re very pleased with the progress we have made in terms of GE customers and contacts with them. Until we actually sign them and move them over onto our platform the revenues that we generate from them are included in other revenues and I was just commenting that on the 15% growth on that line about 600 basis points related to the GE acquisition. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: So you haven\u2019t even converted GE employees to your card yet? So no billed business effect this quarter? \nKenneth Chenault:  No. That is obviously as we said is going to occur over the next several months but up until this point no. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around the trajectory of the lending charge off rate and U.S. billed business on a go forward basis. On the lending side you mentioned the third and fourth quarter rates will be above the June levels. How should we think about it related to seasoning versus cyclical? Will there be some abatement from the seasoning pressure at the end of the year? I know billed business, could you just talk about what caused such a pronounced slow down in May and June? Is it partly related to line reductions or largely related to line reductions? Finally, on lending reserves should we assume that coverage to delinquencies will remain as long as credit remains under pressure? \nDaniel Henry:  I\u2019m not sure if that was one question or five questions. I think there is the seasoning that takes place really takes place about 12-36 in launch measure. So I don\u2019t think in the near term we\u2019re going to see any radical change in the seasoning impact because we have been fortunate in that we have been able to add significant new customers to the franchise which is what our intent is as we strive to drive spend and take share in the market place. Even today based on the investments we are making in the business we will continue to bring on card members. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see seasoning impact have any quick change in the next 6-12 months.  We are having more of an impact of that seasoning on our business than our competitors are because they haven\u2019t grown at the same rate that we have. In terms of billed business and the impact that we saw in May and June we think it is the impact of the economy. We looked across all products. We looked across all tenures. We looked across all FICO scores. As Ken was saying is people with very good FICO scores who have been long tenured customers are just being more cautious in this environment. So we are seeing a strong down in spend really across the board.  That is really what causes us to think that it is the economy plus I think you have seen from all of our competitors they have been impacted in the same manner in the second quarter.  Moving to your last question in terms of what we put up for reserves, reserves is set up as a combination of what we are seeing in write off rates, what we are seeing in roll rates, what we are also sensing is happening in the economy and certainly in June we saw unemployment jump dramatically, consumer confidence is down. So setting the reserve really contemplates all those things in assessing the inherent risks in the portfolio. So I think we will continue to keep what we consider to be an appropriate level of reserves as long as we continue to see slow down in the economy. If the economy were to get worse from here we\u2019d see additions to reserves and when the economy improves we\u2019ll take those reserves down in a prudent fashion. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Brad Ball \u2013 Citigroup. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: A point of clarification on the chart on Page 20. Is that using the old method of computing the write off rate including interest and fees or is that the new method you are talking about excluding those? \nDaniel Henry:  I would think that is the old method including interest and fees. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: In terms of thinking about the magnitude of the impact you are experiencing relative to your industry peers, I think you just acknowledged that you are seeing a faster acceleration in lost dollar amount and loss rates relative to your much higher growth versus peers over the last couple of years, is that correct? \nDaniel Henry:  I wouldn\u2019t call it acceleration Brad. I think we are being impacted the same way everybody is being impacted. Certainly if we decided to bring on fewer customers historically then loss rates in those areas would be lower. The way we view it is the life of the customer. So as we said we can bring on customers that have good economics over their life with us. We want to bring those customers onto the books. To the extent there is a slow down and to the extent we have more customers we are going to have higher write offs to provision in the short-term but our focus isn\u2019t the short-term. Our focus is the medium to long-term and we think that those investments to bring in those customers are a good decision. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think Brad what is important is and it is obviously understandable given the economic environment and credit situation if we were managing the business just for 2008 there would be a different set of strategies and tactics you would put in place. But I think what we have been able to demonstrate is as I look at our overall book of business I think we have best in class customers on our books and I believe that positions us very well from a multi-year standpoint. We take the current economic environment very seriously but what I would emphasize is we are balancing those risks against what we see as very strong opportunity from a multi-year basis.  As we look through history and we look at the last two down turns and that is why I have made this point that competitively I think we are far stronger and I think the quality of our customer base is very strong and as I said best in class. I think we are positioning ourselves so that we have multiple year growth with attractive economics going forward. I think that is the point. We could in fact limit the credit exposure by not growing at all and what I would submit is the economic trade offs we have made have been good trade offs over a multiple year period and that is really the philosophy we have used to manage our business. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: Just as a follow-up, roughly speaking if you look at your 2006 and 2007 vintage loan receivables what proportion of those are MR customers? \nDaniel Henry:  I would say a very high percentage of customers are either MR customers or on a product with our rewards. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: Like Starward or\u2026\nKenneth Chenault:  A rewards based product. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: Are we talking 90%, 100%?\nDaniel Henry:  I would say it is over 90% in volume. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think Brad what is important is that the quality of accounts we have added in recent years is as strong as our traditional card members. So that is an important point I would emphasize. Clearly we have grown but we haven\u2019t grown as a result of lowering the quality of our accounts. In fact the quality of our accounts is as strong as our traditional card members. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from [Inaudible]. \n[Unidentified Analyst]:  I have just a question on how you model future credit losses and the degree of confidence in your modeling given just the changes we are seeing in consumer behavior and the fact that we are seeing, for example, a nationwide decline in home values and we don\u2019t know what that means for consumer behavior. How confident are you in your modeling? Can you talk about how often you review it and the feedback mechanism and how often you would incorporate that into new assumptions? \nDaniel Henry:  We are using historical data to form our view of the future and we look at both the absolute level of performance today as well as the trends over the last several months. We look at what we are seeing in roll rates once things are in delinquency to assess what percentage will ultimately go to write off which helps inform us in terms of where our reserves should be.  What we assume is that roll rates we see today will worsen somewhat over the balance of the year and so I have high confidence in our ability to model what will happen assuming that is exactly what happens; it is slightly worse. Now if next month or over the next few months things get significantly worse then we will build that into the model but it will cause write-offs to be higher in the balance of the year.  Quite frankly the inverse is true. If customer behavior improves then it will be better. So we use all the information at our disposal and we look at not only what is happening in write offs and roll rates but what is happening in spend to help form our view of what is going to happen in the balance of the year. So I feel good about our ability to forecast the next six months. Once you get beyond that it becomes a lot more difficult. \nKenneth Chenault:  I would just really cover this one example which you used which is multiple mortgages. That is just an example of where we have been able to incorporate a change from what we saw historically and the reality is we are looking at a whole set of drivers where we have a constant feedback loop to understand what is the change in causing the credit performance. That is something we are very, very focused on and it really is a constant feedback loop that we have and we have demonstrated we can act on that I think very, very quickly and feed that into our overall system. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Mike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.\nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: Just looking at your slides, Page 18 on roll rates. The dip in May in both the top and bottom is it fair to assume maybe some of that was attributable to the tax rebate checks? \nDaniel Henry:  Hard to say definitively. That certainly could have an impact. I would say sometimes there is movement month to month and we try not to react too dramatically just to one week\u2019s information or one month\u2019s information because as you can see from these charts it can bounce back. May could have been impacted by the rebate checks. It is hard to assess. Our look was that it looked like at least for 30 day past due to write off May seems to be something of an aberration compared to the trend. \nKenneth Chenault:  I would just say the tax rebates that is Dan\u2019s point is we really don\u2019t have any evidence in credit or spending that we are seeing an impact and if you look at the overall profile of our customer base my own personal view would be I don\u2019t think there is much impact. I can\u2019t say that for certain but when I look at the profile of our customer base I don\u2019t think that would have much of an impact. \nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: On your comments on the multiple mortgages attribute. Could you maybe clarify why would that have been a positive effect and how quickly have you made that change to the underwriting model? \nDaniel Henry:  The comment is just based on historical performance. Historically folks that had multiple mortgages appeared to be people who had the capacity to handle those mortgages, continue to be financially balanced and continue to spend and make payments on our product. That is just a historical fact. What we have started to see is that in this environment probably heavily impacted by the drop in housing prices that the inverse is starting to happen. As a group people who have multiple mortgages are starting to perform less well than folks who do not have multiple mortgages. As we started to see that and we started to build that into our credit decision so that our models are as up to date as possible to help us make the best decision. \nKenneth Chenault:  I think on the multiple mortgage issue the reality is an example you had a historically highly credit worthy customer who had very good credit scores. The issue is for a multiple mortgage if they had a sharp valuation decline some of them are caught in the middle and so you wouldn\u2019t see that up front in modeling that someone\u2019s credit score was different. This was a group that I would say intuitively would stand to reason that in a range of environments, highly credit worthy, they have multiple mortgages and then they had a price decline on one or two of those properties and that is going to have an impact. By any modeling you have done they looked like and acted and performed and paid as very good customers. That is why I point to the example but I think the logic of it, which was born out by their performance over multi-year periods was that these were very highly creditworthy people who in fact performed well.\nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: Have you seen a more pronounced area of change in the areas most affected by the home price depreciation? California? Florida? \nDaniel Henry:  Absolutely, that was true in the first quarter and continues to be true this quarter. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS. \nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: Just to get back to the roll rate analysis, the roll rate obviously is an important tool in determining the number of current people going bad that will ultimately go through default. Do you have a view about incremental incidents of loss which won\u2019t be reflected there? \nDaniel Henry:  This is historical data so the question is how many people who are current today will ultimately go past due and we will ultimately write off. We use the historical data we have and as I said we increased above the current level to reflect our view of the economy but having that is going to worsen or improve I think would be very much driven by the economy we see in the U.S. \nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: I\u2019m trying to determine whether there is an expectation I think it will or will not get worse and whether that is baked into this future loss expectation? \nDaniel Henry:  Our reserve anticipates higher write-offs in the third and fourth quarter and anticipates the roll rates will get somewhat worse. \nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: If I can just ask a follow-up on slide 20. Do you have any commentary on the slope of the recent vintages and how much that differential versus some older vintages relate to a seasoning issue versus changes in underwriting? \nDaniel Henry:  That is clearly a key question and I think the reason we included these multiple years is that from the very early origination years of 2001 and 2002 you can see the normal seasoning take place. But as you can see it is having an impact on the 2003, 2004, 2005 vintages which are very strong vintages so it causes us to conclude the impact we are seeing in 2007 and 2006 is being driven by the economy as opposed to that group was less credit worthy than the groups in the earlier years. \nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: I\u2019m having difficulty reconciling that with the severity of the slope on the 2006 and 2007. It would seem to suggest that they are following the same pattern but seem to be more fully loaded curves. \nDaniel Henry:  I think the folks in the 12-36 months are probably the most vulnerable group because they are in the height of the curve and the height of the curve is where you are going to have the greatest impact. That is the most logical assumption to me. I think you are seeing some of the other curves here move up by 100 basis points on each plot point. I think you have to look at all the data you have available. If you look at slide 21 here clearly you can see that using FICO scores as an indicator we not only didn\u2019t drop FICO scores but we actually increased in customers just looking at FICO scores. I think the plot points you are seeing for 2006 is reflecting the fact they are at the height of the curve and therefore are being more impacted but we still think we have a large group of customers within that origination year who will be terrific customers long-term. \nKenneth Chenault:  The other point again is we keep on emphasizing is we don\u2019t use FICO scores from a modeling standpoint but to categorize where we have come out we have given this example and the blue card portfolio which is the largest 12% in 2001 were 750 and above FICO scores. At the end of 2006 46% were 750 or above. It just goes back to a quality of customer that we have been bringing in. Obviously there is an impact from a seasoning standpoint and an impact on the economic environment overall but I do not believe it is an issue that we have lowered the criteria to add more customers. \nDaniel Henry:  I must add that a point I\u2019d make that when you look at the earlier terms for customers who came in 2001-2004, they were going through that difficult seasoning period when the economy was very strong and so naturally you would expect them to be lower than the curves. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Dan given your comment the reserves are anticipated, any deterioration in losses, I noticed you and you expressed them as a potential for delinquencies and your ratio of charge offs to delinquencies doubled over the last year. It went from 135-137% up to 175% and if you look at the global owned charge offs they are running in the second quarter 30% at an annual rate ahead of reserve and you are saying you expect it to go up so I wanted to understand how anticipatory that is and what we should expect for the reserve if charge off\u2019s increase in the third and fourth quarters? \nDaniel Henry:  Usually we show old and managed statistics. Generally we look more often to the managed specifics where I think about the health of the overall franchise. Over the last three years when the economy was strong coverage ratio in delinquencies has been in the 95-100% range. We have taken them up to 135% on a loan basis and 144% on a managed basis which are, I think at the levels we had when we were back in the last slowdown. We actually feel very comfortable that we have an appropriate level of reserves based on what we\u2019ve seen to date and anticipate it will be somewhat worse going forward. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: How many months in charge off\u2019s do you expect to keep in reserve? \nDaniel Henry:  We don\u2019t use loans coverage of write off. It is one of the statistics we obviously look at. So currently we would have over 12 months of write off coverage in our book and even assuming that write-offs increase the way that our models say even after that if you looked out to December we would have over [inaudible] coverage. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: I\u2019m having trouble with that since the current annualized charge off rate is in excess of the reserve in both loans and a managed basis. \nDaniel Henry:  I\u2019m not sure exactly what the rate you are referring to? \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: There is $827 million in write-offs on the owned worldwide portfolio and $2.6 million in reserves. So $800 x 4 is $3.2 million or $3.3 million. \nDaniel Henry :  I think for the two months comped, right, first I recommend we do it on a managed basis and we have to go back and that number is for one month of the quarter so you actually have to track back over the last three quarters. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: So you are saying it is historical not a prospect? \nDaniel Henry:  Yes it is historical. \nOperator:  Your last question comes from Scott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.   \nScott Valentin \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. : Historically you had it get out that a few everyday spend categories is slow but modest pressure on the discount rate. I was wondering given the comments of moving away from discretionary and moving towards non-discretionary spend if you expect the discount pressure to accelerate? \nDaniel Henry:  I think without any pricing actions on our part based on the growth and every day spend we would expect the discount rate to drop by 2-3 basis points a year. However, we have been very successful with certain categories to go back to that and demonstrate the value that we bring to them and actually have been able to increase price. As a result of that, last year I think we stayed pretty flat. This year we have seen a very modest reduction in discount rate. So we will continue I think to see growth in every day spend pressure on the discount rate but I think we will also continue to look at whether it is appropriate based on the value we bring to increase certain categories. \nKenneth Chenault:  I would also say that given some of the reward programs and marketing programs that we have created the reality is there are a number of merchants in a range of categories who want to build business up. The point is while we have seen decline since I have talked about at some of our more affluent customers, their loyalty to the product and their use of the product has continued. So I think that was is incumbent upon us and we have been successful at this the last several years is to continue to increase the value that we can provide merchants and to use what is clearly a very challenging economic time to reinforce our value and bring more business to merchants.  So while no one likes being in this situation I think it is an opportunity for us to continue to demonstrate the value we are providing merchants and to have that card member assistance and loyalty which I think is still continuing despite the fact that people are lowering their level of spending. When they are spending we want them obviously using our product and services.  We want to thank everyone for joining the call this afternoon. As usual we will be available for follow-up questions a portion of this evening and certainly tomorrow and over the coming days. Once again thanks very much for joining us and we look forward to talk with you.  The one point I would make is there is an analyst meeting coming up in early August and I think as we indicated in the invite there will be further discussion by Al Kelly and Ed Gilligan around our business and trends and the like and look forward to seeing many of you there as well.  Thanks very much."}, {"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 1, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-04-25 00:12:09", "content": "Executives: Ron Stovall \u2013 Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Daniel T.

Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Meredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.  \nOperator: Welcome to the American Express first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Stovall. \nRon Stovall : As usual it\u2019s my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  In the first quarter 2008 earnings release and supplement which are now posted on our website at ir.AmericanExpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report we have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Express will provide some introductory remarks highlighting the key points related to today\u2019s announcement.  Once he completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: As you\u2019ve seen in our earnings documents despite the more difficult economic environment our first quarter results reflect the continuation of strong business growth on a relative basis and the benefit of our diversified business portfolio, our multiyear investments and a broad range of business building initiatives again yield industry leading performance for the quarter as they have over the past few years. As expected, earnings for the quarter were somewhat below last year. Our strong revenue growth was offset by the impact of the difficult US credit environment and higher marketing spending compared to the lower amounts in 2007.  As we discuss the results it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the translation of foreign currency significantly impacted recorded revenues and expense growth rates increasing each by 3%. When you compare our results from continuing operations to the first quarter of last year net revenue grew 11% while income decreased 11% and diluted EPS of $0.84 decreased 7%. ROE was 36%.  For those of you who follow revenue consensus estimates that each quarter there has been some noise around the way that the consensus is tabulated by some reporting services. This continues to be the case as it is computed in a way that is likely to be above our reported numbers. Let me remind you that last year\u2019s first quarter included $50 million after tax from the initial adoption of FAS 155 and $39 million after tax pension related gain. Both of these contributed to the year-over-year decline in income.  During the quarter we returned 38% of capital generated to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We slowed our share repurchase program during the quarter in order to allow the capital generated through earnings to help fund the recent acquisition of GE\u2019s corporate payment services business.  Since 1994 we have returned 70% of capital generated to shareholders which is above our 65% long term target. The 11% revenue growth in the quarter reflects double digit growth in a number of categories including discount revenue, card member lending finance revenue, card fee revenue and commissions and fees. Additionally, revenue growth reflected the benefit of lower interest rates. Revenue continues to be driven by solid growth in card member spending, loans and cards in force. Given the weaker economic environment worldwide billed business growth for the quarter was particularly strong at 14% or 11% on an FX adjusted basis which is the more important indicator of the underlying health of the business volumes. In our US proprietary business consumer spending grew 7% in the quarter, small business spending increased 11% and corporate services volumes rose by 8%.  These growth rates while far better than the industry are 300 basis points lower than the growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2007. In total US volumes for retail and everyday spending grew 11%. This category represented about 68% of US billings. Travel and entertainment related spending which accounts for the remainder rose 8%. Outside the US proprietary billed business grew 22% on a reported basis. This translated to an increase of 10% on an FX adjusted basis reflecting 9% growth in our consumer and small business activity and a 10% increase in corporate services. These growth rates have held up well outside of the US.  Within global network services billed business rose 50% driven by continued robust growth both in and outside of the US. Worldwide cards in force rose 10%. We added 1.6 million net new cards during the quarter and 8.1 million net new cards since last year. This reflects 5% growth versus last year in proprietary cards and 33% growth in network partner cards.  Spending per proprietary basic card rose 6% worldwide while 3% on an FX adjusted basis even with the suppressing effects of substantial card additions over the past few years. Our average discount rate of 2.57% decreased one basis point from last year but increased versus last quarter reflecting the typical seasonal impact of lower retail related business volumes in the first quarter.  Net card fee revenue increased 17% due to card growth as well as higher average fees per card. Travel commissions and fees increased 13% driven by 15% increase in travel sales. Worldwide lending balances on an owned basis rose 17%. On a vantage basis balances grew 19% on 18% growth in the US and 23% or a 13% FX adjusted growth within our non-US portfolios.  \\This is a slower growth rate in the US managed loans than recent quarters due to the initial impact of various credit related actions such as targeted line reductions for higher risk customer segments, industries and geographies and increased efforts in our collection and credit areas and the flow through of slower spending growth within our co-brand, lending on charge and other credit card relationships.  These were partially offset by a slowdown in payment trades consistent with the weaker economic environment. Securitization income decreased 3% a higher finance charge and fee revenue driven by higher securitized loans and a lower cost of funds were more than offset by a higher write offs and a smaller increase in the valuation of our interest only strip this year versus last year which was mostly due to last year\u2019s FAS 115 adoption gain.  Card member lending finance revenue rose 19% on growth in the owned portfolio. Interest expense increased 9%. This was due to an 8% increase to funding costs within the lending business and a 10% increase within the charge card and other interest expense line. These increases reflect loan and business volume growth which was partially offset by the benefits related to the decrease in the LIBOR benchmark rate.  Marketing, promotions, rewards and card member service expense increased 20% reflecting greater marketing investments versus a relatively low level of marketing last year as well as higher volume related reward costs. Human resource expense increased 13% reflecting last year\u2019s pension gain, merit increase, greater benefit costs and a 4% higher employee level primarily related to various customer service and sales force related initiatives in addition to late year\u2019s corporate travel acquisition.  Growth in the remaining operating expense reflects the impact of increased volumes within our technology and card member servicing activities and shows that the underlying operating expense continued to be well controlled. The total provision for losses and benefit increased 48% versus last year as the charge provision rose 65%, the lending provision increased by 41% and the other provision was 61% higher.  The lending and charge provision increased due to the higher write off rates and delinquency rates reflecting the more difficult US credit environment and loan and business volume growth worldwide. The other provision rose on greater merchant related provision in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the delta related provision benefit in the first quarter of 2007. The consolidated tax rate of 28% for the quarter reflects the resolution of certain prior year tax items compared to the 32% rate last year.  With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Business metric performance by growth in billed business and loan balances continued to be in the top tier of the industry. The GAAP between our growth rates and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years.  Business growth also benefitted from the relatively strong growth in our global network services and our non-US consumer and commercial card activities reflecting the benefit of the diversity of our business segments and our business model and the balance within our results. While losses and past due levels within the United States lending portfolio have trended higher our credit quality indicators compare favorable to the industry and continue to reflect the benefits of our focus on the premium market sectors.  As we\u2019ve discussed before our write off rate calculations include principle, accrued interest and accrued fee versus the principle only calculation that our competitors generally publish and utilize. This serves to overstate our comparable rate by about 20%. Overall, our first quarter metrics demonstrates that the business performance was dimensionally consistent with the 2008 plan that we\u2019d discussed with you back in January.  We believe we are managing credit effectively in a difficult environment. Although are actions are compressing spending volumes somewhat and will negatively impact credit metrics in the near term. The managed US card member write off rate rose from 4.3% in the fourth quarter to 4.3% in the first quarter.  I want to point out that the rate for March was higher than the average rate for the quarter. Therefore, we expect that the loan loss rate will be higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter. In addition to the combined impact of our actions and the current environmental conditions will likely cause loan growth to be slower than the 16% growth assumed in the initial plan. We do not plan to update our view of our metric trends as the continually evolve and will likely vary from our original plan assumptions as we progress through the year.  However, our performance together with the flexibility inherent in our business model affirms our belief that we are still tracking to the reported EPS growth assumption of 4% to 6% that we discussed earlier in the year. This expectation is based on the economic environment that is consistent with or moderately worse than what we have experienced to date.  If conditions were to significantly deteriorate from here we would likely be more focused on the medium to long term strength of the franchise versus our short term objectives. Our strategy continues to be centered on positioning us to continue to gain profitable share regardless of the environmental conditions. And, in light of this difficult environment we believe we are prudently balancing risk against profitability and growth.  As we have discussed with you before, our ultimate goal is to continue to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging economic conditions in the best position possible relative to our payment competitors and relative to the overall industry. We will continue to be guided by our long term, on average and over time financial objectives. Since we set these objectives in 1993 we have generally performed consistent with these goals and in fact, have outperformed them in recent years.  Given our industry leading results and the products, customers and geographic breadth of our franchise we believe we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance short, medium and long term business and financial goals.  We are now ready to take questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: One thing that really stuck with me at your semiannual meeting in February was the market decline you saw in consumer spending for the month of November to December. I know you said you didn\u2019t want to do this but can you directionally comment on what you see in consumer spending? And, remind us, if you told us about the line issue in terms of cutting consumer credit lines, when that took place and if that\u2019s accelerated throughout the quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: We saw a 300 basis point drop in December in the US consumer and small business and as I indicated in the first quarter we had a 300 basis point drop across various lines of business in the US compared to the fourth quarter. I\u2019m not going to give information month-by-month, I think that\u2019s probably too detailed but I would say the 300 basis point drop first quarter to fourth quarter is consistent with what we saw in December, so we\u2019re seeing a continuation of that.  In terms of the line reductions that we\u2019ve done with regard to certain lending customers, as soon as we saw the deterioration in credit we took a look at our credit policies and practices and we have heightened default rates across the board, we have also been surgical in terms of looking at certain geographies because default rates are higher in certain geographies. We\u2019ve also looked at certain industries where they have weakness and in those we\u2019ve taken special actions as well.  So, as soon as we saw the credit indicators start to deteriorate which was back in December and we\u2019ve continued that really through the first quarter in total. So, the number of line reductions in the first quarter was significantly more than we would have seen on average in 2007 and we\u2019ve seen probably fewer line increases.  We\u2019re trying to be very focused on balancing and controlling credit properly. On the other hand we don\u2019t want to damage the long term health of the business so really balancing long term considerations for customers with the desire to control credit in the short term.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: You\u2019ve seen a flurry of large caps like yourself change their funding strategy over the last few weeks or augment their funding strategy over the last few weeks. Could you update us as to any changes that you see? Any tweaks you\u2019d like to make to your funding strategy and any changes you see to your securitization strategy?\nDaniel T. Henry: We really haven\u2019t changed our strategy, we actually fund across a number of areas so we borrow in the commercial paper market, we borrow in the unsecured market and thirdly, we borrow through securitizations. So, there has been an absence of availability in the unsecured one to five year market really over the last six, seven or eight months.  But, there has been perfect availability in commercial paper, we continue to fund there the way we always have and have not seen any price increases in that funding vehicle. We do have availability in the unsecured market, five to 10 years. Liquidity has been there for us and also there\u2019s plenty of liquidity in the securitization market.  Now, in the unsecure and the securitization market, we have seen the impact of what\u2019s taking place in LIBOR impacting what we have to borrow at. Plus, the credit spreads above LIBOR in the first quarter were higher than we\u2019ve seen historically. But, there\u2019s plenty of liquidity, you have to pay up a little bit.  One of the other things I\u2019d say, just to point out to you, on our website we included on the website some information about the funding we\u2019re doing, debt funding we\u2019re doing. And, in there we indicated that we were going to fund this year $37 billion over the course of the year. In fact, because of the slowdown in the business, that\u2019s now $34 billion.  I\u2019d point out that we funded about $7.8 of that in the first quarter and in the first 15 days of April we actually funded another $4.8. So, there\u2019s been plenty of availability in terms of funding for us. We think we have a very strong liquidity plan and funding plan. We\u2019re an A plus, a strong A plus rated company. I think we\u2019re well regarded in the marketplace and we\u2019ve been able to fund just find. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Craig Maurer - Calyon. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: Looking at the increase in your marketing expense year-over-year could you comment on how much of that growth is related to higher rewards points accrual?\nDaniel T. Henry: Our rewards, we don\u2019t split out those two numbers. I think historically we\u2019ve given the dimensional split between marketing and rewards. I would say that our rewards costs have grown dimensionally in line with the growth in the business.  The rest of the increase is really the fact that last year we took our marketing spending down which we explained at that time. This year we\u2019ve brought it back up to more normal levels so the 20% increase on that line is a combination of volume related expenses on rewards plus higher level of marketing compared to the first quarter of last year. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: On the credit side, the reserve coverage ratio that you have in place right now which seems to be in line historically with where you\u2019ve been, are we to assume that you\u2019re going to maintain that similar level of coverage? Or, will that be increasing due to like you said March was the highest quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: The reserve coverage of delinquencies in charge card is 96% this quarter compared to 95% last quarter. On the lending side on an owned basis the coverage ratio was 100% in the fourth quarter and is now 101% and if you look at lending on a managed basis it went from 106% to 105%.  So, we\u2019re keeping it in the first quarter at dimensionally a similar level that we had at year end. Where we\u2019ll take reserve coverage in the future will depend upon the economy and the delinquencies that we\u2019re seeing in our own business and what credit actions we\u2019re taking. When you\u2019re setting we also take in to consideration what your recent acquisitions have been so I think we\u2019ll take all those factors in to consideration in the future in terms of where we\u2019ll set our reserves and our coverage ratios. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: Have you thought about how the GE acquisition will affect that coverage yet?\nDaniel T. Henry: I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. It\u2019s about $4 billion of business so I don\u2019t think it will have a dramatic impact on the overall ratios and we\u2019ll make an evaluation what the appropriate coverage ratios are for that particular portfolio based on historical experience.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bob Napoli - Piper Jaffray. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : On the funding side, can you quantify the percentage of your funding that is floating rate at this point and how much benefit you got? I understand your spreads were up and LIBOR is up and obviously the Fed has cut rates a lot more so you must be benefitting so I was just wondering if you could give a feel for how much benefit you\u2019re getting from the interest expense side? And, I would imagine that you would expect that to somewhat offset the higher credit losses that you\u2019re probably going to see this year versus your prior plan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Approximately 30% of our funding is fixed either because it\u2019s fixed rate or it\u2019s fixed through hedges. In the annual report I think we make a disclosure on as it relates to charge card or fixed rate lending products a 100 basis point drop in funding costs yields us about $225 million in benefit.  Now, you\u2019d have to think about our funding costs not just where the Fed has gone because it\u2019s actually the LIBOR rate that\u2019s key and you have to factor in where credit spreads and both LIBOR have gone. So, I think you need to think about all of those. As it relate to our variable rate book, I think you have to think about it a little differently because when we designed the product we really just want to lock in a spread and when interest rates go up or down that\u2019s really the cost that gets passed on to the customer.  And, inherent in there is there\u2019s an assumption that there\u2019s a relationship between Fed funds and LIBOR rates because we price to our customer off of prime which is driven by Fed funds. So now that LIBOR is not moving in concert with Fed funds, that has a negative impact on us and that\u2019s moderating the benefit that we\u2019re getting. So, over time it will be important for us to have Fed funds move back more in line with LIBOR rather move back more in line with Fed funds.  So, we\u2019re getting a benefit clearly but I think you have to factor in all the things I just discussed to fully understand what the impact will be and as we go forward to the rest of the year how much benefit we\u2019ll get will also depend on the relationship of those two curves.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Is it your expectation though that that benefit is offsetting the higher provisions that you\u2019ll likely have?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think interest rates as I think about our business to the extent you stay floating are always a built in hedge. So, if you actually have higher provision and slower growth and billings normally interest rates would go down and actually hedge that economic condition and we\u2019re actually seeing that happen during the current period. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : American Express is trading around 12 times earnings and you can argue that the earnings could be cyclically get impaired more than what the people currently have them modeled at, nonetheless it would be cyclically impaired to improve when the credit cycle improves. But, you have MasterCard and Visa trading at 25 times or 30 times earnings.  You\u2019re earning double what maybe a Visa might earn but have a lower market cap so that brings some strategic thoughts, it must or certainly discussions within American Express about what the right structure is and does the lending business have to be attached or should they be separated? I just don\u2019t know if you can give any thoughts? I\u2019d love to hear what thoughts you have on valuation of American Express versus competitors of yours in MasterCard and Visa.\nDaniel T. Henry: We certainly do discuss our PE, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re focused on because it\u2019s an important part of our share price which is important to our shareholders. So, if you went back several months ago there certainly was a notable higher PE for us compared to the issuing competitors.  When you think about our company I think you really need to think about the various elements of it because we do have some diversified businesses here. Within the issuing side, we have a charge card business which has less credit risk attached to it and I think probably deserves a PE that\u2019s higher than the average of the industry.  Obviously, you have a lending component of that but then our B-to-B business we have corporate services which certainly have less risk again, it\u2019s a charge card company and should derive a higher PE from that. Then, we have our merchant business and G&S business which is much more analogous to either a processor such as First Date Resource or a network such as Visa and MasterCard. So, I think our PE over the years has reflected that.  I think people need to focus on the fact that there are really several different elements to it. I think what we\u2019re trying to do is to navigate through the short term here in the best possible condition, maintain our business momentum and come out of the slowdown in stronger position compared to our competitors and that we think if we do that that will be in the best interest of our shareholders and hopefully get reflected in our share price over time. In terms of lending, lending is a important part of our business. We put value proposition into the marketplace that we think customers want to use and then we let them decide whether they want to use a charge card or a lending product. The important thing for us is that it\u2019s a spend focused card and that\u2019s how we design our products. So, we think all pieces of our business is an important part and people should think about each of those components when they think about our evaluation. \nRon Stovall : Also if you looked at the performance of the company over the last really five to 10 years, the performance has been really very strong and consistent with, if not better than over recent years, our financial targets and I think the performance that we\u2019ve been able to generate is clearly differentiated from most companies in the marketplace and hopefully that will give us some credit on the PE side over time.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: So we should just think about the \u201808 guidance as being 4% to 6% EPS growth and not think about the charge off guidance and the worldwide billed business guidance you provided in January?\nDaniel T. Henry: That\u2019s correct.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Just in terms of your expectations on credit quality when you mentioned in January and how things are progressing, I just want to know how the behavior has been across segments, vintages, etc. On the tax rate I just wanted to get a sense of what a good tax rate would be to use on a corporate level because it seemed like it was a little bit lower than what I thought it would be. \nDaniel T. Henry: On the spending side we\u2019ve really seen in the US the slowdown really across all products, all vintages, and all geographies. On the credit side it\u2019s been different, where we\u2019ve seen the greatest impact are in geographies where the housing market has really dropped more than 5% or more than 10%. So, when we look at our data and we look at geographies that really have not had a drop in housing there really hasn\u2019t been that much deterioration and where there\u2019s been a greater drop, the greater the drop in housing prices the greater the change or deterioration in credit metrics.  The other key thing that we\u2019ve looked at is look at where people stand in terms of their mortgage. So, if you look at folks that are either renters or people who have had a mortgage that is older than 2003 again, it\u2019s been relatively modest change in terms of credit behavior. On the other hand, if you look at folks who have a mortgage that is more recent than that or people where we don\u2019t have mortgage information that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the greatest increase in delinquencies. That\u2019s to give you an idea of how it\u2019s different but it\u2019s really different on the credit side as opposed to on the spend side. To answer your question about tax rate, I would generally think about a tax rate in the low 30% range, 30% to 32%. Over the last several quarter in certain quarters it\u2019s been lower than that such as this quarter and that\u2019s really driven by the fact that we\u2019ve settled and resolved certain prior period tax issues that resulted in the benefit to us and therefore it lowers the tax rate in the period that\u2019s settled. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: So, for the remainder of the year 30% to 32% is a good run rate to use quarterly?\nDaniel T. Henry: I won\u2019t do a forecast on the rest of the year but I would think absent some settlements related to prior years that 30% to 32% rate is about the right run rate. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Just one more question on that credit color, how about small business? That\u2019s an area that we\u2019ve heard some of your competitors talk about seeing quite a bit of deterioration. I\u2019m wondering if I could just get some color on that.\nDaniel T. Henry: In some prior periods we\u2019ve said small business was a leading indicator that credit was going to deteriorate. That wasn\u2019t the case this time. We should keep in mind that small business just by the nature of the business has higher credit losses in good times or bad times than consumer. But, what we\u2019ve seen so far is both a similar impact to both consumer and small business during the cycle in terms of our card members.  Now, in terms of our merchant business we actually had some higher provisions in this quarter in part because some of the small businesses that are merchants we\u2019ve seen some impact there and so we set up reserves to cover ourselves on the merchant side. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Hochstim - Bear Stearns. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns:  Did you explain or divest what the investment losses that were in the corporate segment were this quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: As part of the sale of AEB to Standard Chartered, part of that was an agreement that we would continue to own AEIDC which was a subsidiary in which they actually had investments and then deposits really from customers where they invested money and made payments to customers, we would hold that for 18 months past the time of the closing. In the first quarter we actually had about $100 million of losses related to that AEIDC portfolio.  Now, when we first took the portfolio we had about $4 billion worth of investments in mortgage backed and other asset backed investments and we took that down to about $1.6 billion as of yearend and we\u2019ve now taken it down to I think $783 million. So we\u2019ve really reduced our exposure within that portfolio. 93% of the assets within the remaining portfolio are AAA rated. That probably gives us less comfort than it used to but basically that $100 million loss that we had in the first quarter we\u2019ve made into that portfolio.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Was that a realized loss or mark-to-market?\nDaniel T. Henry: A combination of both.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: And so were there other unrealized losses that haven\u2019t been marked-to-market?\nDaniel T. Henry: The mark-to-market was the vast majority of it.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: You said you\u2019re not providing guidance, but in January you did talk about a 5.1% to 5.3% charge off range for the year and you indicated you were above that now. Is there some relationship we should think about between billed business growth and that loss rate? Billed business was a little bit higher than I think you thought in the first quarter.\nDaniel T. Henry: Certainly billed business was a strain in the fourth quarter and then it was higher than the full year guidance that we indicated. In terms of billed business we continue to be very cautious in terms of our outlook as it relates to US. On the other hand we\u2019re encouraged by the performance internationally. So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out.  Again, I think our performance compares very favorably to competitors. On the credit side, as I said, we came in at 5.3 for the quarter and we expect that be higher in the second quarter. Where credit will go after that is very dependent on a combination of the economy and what business actions we take in the future.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Is there a reason to think that it won\u2019t go? Shouldn\u2019t we expect it to go higher when we look at the delinquency trends? Those moved up pretty significantly in the first quarter as well.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve indicated that the second quarter will be higher than the first quarter in delinquencies. A large part of the delinquencies will play out in the second quarter. But what happens to those people who are current or only 30 days will be very much driven by what happens in the economy.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: And did you see any change in roll rates in the quarter relative to the fourth quarter? A significant change? The later stage buckets?\nDaniel T. Henry: You can see that just total delinquencies are higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t really give out disclosures, bucket by bucket.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Bear Stearns: Right, that\u2019s why I was asking.\nDaniel T. Henry: No, we don\u2019t disclose that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Ball - Citi. \nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: Dan, that you did say in your prepared comments that you\u2019re seeing slower payment rates and in response to an earlier question you were talking about seeing more credit deterioration in the markets where home prices have dropped 5% to 10%. Are those things what\u2019s accountable for the change in credit results versus what your outlook was back in January?\nDaniel T. Henry: Certainly payment rate is slowing down. I don\u2019t know it by geography but I think it\u2019s probably reasonably broad based. There\u2019s lots of things we can do in terms of how much we allow people to spend, but it\u2019s completely up to them in terms of how much they decide to pay. We\u2019ve actually had a nice move in terms of the growth in managed, they are in the US. It dropped from 23% growth in the fourth quarter down to 18% growth. We think that\u2019s a good trend given the environment that we\u2019re in. But I don\u2019t have specific information on pay downs as it relates to geographies.\nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: And then a follow up on the comments you made earlier about the $34 billion of funding in \u201808, is that all expected to be done in the ABS market and what pricing are you seeing on ABS deals these days versus where they were a year ago and where would you expect them to normalize and any idea when?\nDaniel T. Henry: I don\u2019t have any idea when, that would be nice to know that I think. Lots of people would like to know the answer to that question. We don\u2019t fund solely in the securitization sector. It\u2019s really a combination of commercial paper, unsecured debt and securitization.  In the first quarter and in the first two weeks of April, we actually borrowed certainly in the commercial paper market but we also did a number of ABS transactions. In January we did about $3.7 billion of ABS, but we also did about $3 billion of unsecured and if you look at what we actually did in April, again it was a combination of ABS transactions where we did about $2.5 billion. We also did another $2.5 billion approximately in unsecured. So we really continue to borrow through each of those channels as we have historically.\nBrad Ball \u2013 Citigroup: And where is the pricing on those?\nDaniel T. Henry: The pricing is certainly higher than what we saw historically. Often we were paying 10 to 20 basis points above LIBOR. Back in early January on a three year deal we paid 45 basis points above LIBOR. In February on a 10-year deal we did 126 basis points above LIBOR. Then in April they came back a little bit.  We did two year ABS at 95 basis points above LIBOR. We did a six year deal at 140 basis points above LIBOR and then we did a one year deal at 70 basis points. It really depends on the maturity or the length the debt is going to be outstanding, but I would say its come back a little bit in April compared to where we were in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom - UBS.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: You said your expectations at this point are based on an economy that looks similar to ours or maybe moderately worse, but would you mind just quantifying what that means in terms of nominal GDP and unemployment?\nDaniel T. Henry: I wouldn\u2019t try to put either an unemployment number on significantly or a GDP number. I think certainly if unemployment moves up a little bit or GDP slides a little bit, I think we would say with our current thoughts about where we\u2019re tracking in terms of EPS.  If they were to move notably, and I\u2019m not going to put a percentage on that, then that will have an impact on our business decisions and at that juncture we\u2019d have to decide is the correct thing to do is to pull back on spending and continue to track towards 4% to 6% or should we be more focused on continuing to spend at comparable levels, move away from that EPS number and be more focused on continuing to have strong business momentum.  No matter what the facts are we\u2019ll be very focused on continuing the business momentum we have and investing at a level that will enable us to continue to take share just as we have over the last several years.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: Could you just help me to think about how as an outside observer of the company we can make a judgment about whether the broader economy is moving in \u201808 that\u2019s consistent with your expectations or perhaps worse than?\nDaniel T. Henry: I\u2019ve tried to indicate that I\u2019m not an economist; we don\u2019t have any economists at American Express so I really don\u2019t try to forecast where the economy is going. What I try to do is set up a plan based on a certain set of economic assumptions and then we have a contingency plan, either positive or negative depending on which way the economy moves.  Now we could take a very dire forecast of the economy and really pull back on spending now. We\u2019ve chosen not to do that because if it doesn\u2019t really move down, then we would have missed the business opportunity. I think the thing that\u2019s important is us to know what actions we\u2019ll take to either spend more money or less money, depending on where the economy goes, and be ready to move quickly in that direction. And we have those plans. I\u2019m not trying to forecast the economy, but I\u2019m ready for a variety of scenarios so that we can operate in the most positive way going forward.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 UBS: If things were to get worse, what would be the first two actions that you would look to take?\nDaniel T. Henry: We have a variety of actions that we could take including how much spend on marketing, how much we spend on technology, how much we spend on consultants, contractors, just a lot of overall operating expense levels would be.  So those are all things that we\u2019ll consider, but we don\u2019t consider them in isolation. We have to consider them in terms of if we take those actions, what will be the impact on mid-term metrics and the mid-term health of the business and we\u2019ll factor all those things together in determining whether we actually reduce expenditures or whether we decide to stay where we are or increase them.  Another barometer is just what we\u2019re doing with credit, right? Depending on where the economy goes we could tighten up on credit further, we may assess that at this point it\u2019s better to actually loosen up on credit and let more billings come through. Our total objective will never be just one line item in the P&L; our objective is not to have, for instance, the lowest possible provision rate. It\u2019s really to make decisions that have the greatest economic gain over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill. \nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: Dan, how should we view the $70 million payment that you received from Visa this quarter? Should we just assume that that was reinvested in the marketing line?\nDaniel T. Henry: Visa\u2019s payments that we\u2019ll receive for the next four years we really consider to be part of ongoing operations. In some quarters, we\u2019ll fully reinvest it, on others we won\u2019t. In the first quarter we came into the year really very cautious about what was going to take place. We actually only approved certain limiting spending against that $70 million.  We were actually comfortable doing that because as part of our regular plan we had planned to actually increase marketing expense quite a bit compared to last year. Each quarter we\u2019ll make an evaluation about how much we\u2019ll spend. We have already approved some spending over the balance of the year of those Visa funds and then after that each quarter we\u2019ll make an evaluation of whether we\u2019re going to approve more of that for investment spending.\nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: Could you give us a little bit of color on what\u2019s going on with the utilization rates on both consumers and small businesses? Are you seeing those utilization rates going up over the last three to six months, let\u2019s say, or have they been basically stable?\nDaniel T. Henry: Utilization rates are curious. Customers self regulate themselves. Customers generally only like to take their line to 50%, 60%, and 70% of their total line. I think they always like to keep some for a rainy day. Quite frankly when someone hits their line, that\u2019s an indicator to us that we need to be very cautious about them in terms of payment behaviors and whether we consider actually increasing the line or not.  I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen a marked change in the utilization percentage. Certainly the extent we\u2019ve reduced lines on people, that clearly has had an impact to help our credit, but it\u2019s probably also had an impact in terms of reducing spending in the first quarter in those categories where we\u2019ve actually reduced lines.\nMike Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners L.P.: Where do you stand with what\u2019s going on with the airlines? Are you withholding more cash these days given the high price of oil and some airline bankruptcies?\nDaniel T. Henry: We evaluate all airlines on an individual basis. They are very big customers of ours. We have exposure because to the extent a card member buys a ticket that card member pays us, we pay the airline and to the extent they\u2019re not going to fly for a week or two months during that time we basically have frankly a receivable from that airline but if they were to liquidate we wouldn\u2019t collect it.  Over the years we\u2019ve been very focused on this. When appropriate we do hold back to mitigate whatever exposure we have. Over the years, from time to time, we\u2019ve had small losses, but we\u2019ve never had any large significant losses in the airline industry. We don\u2019t have a blanket policy, it\u2019s airline by airline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: You said that the expectation was for higher losses but similar earnings, would you say that the steps that would be needed to offset those higher losses already were taken in the form of falling interest rates or do you have to make changes in a marketing front on top of that?\nDaniel T. Henry: I didn\u2019t make any forecasts for the full year as it relates to credit losses. I simply indicated that in the second quarter we think write off rates are going to be higher than they were in the first quarter. Our assessment of the full year and tracking to the 4% to 6% takes into effect everything that\u2019s happening, from billings, from fees, finance charge revenue, interest rates, investment spending, operating expenses. We factor all those things together. We\u2019re believe we\u2019re still tracking to the 4% to 6% EPS for the year.\nOperator: You follow up question from Meredith Whitney - Oppenheimer. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: You say you don\u2019t have internal economists yet the external economists and whatnot are known to call you and ask for guidance. Wouldn\u2019t you have ability to see from a behavioral standpoint further out into a couple of quarters and comment on that? And then with respect to the guidance on the losses, the losses are accelerating, so why would you assume that they would do anything other than stabilize at best if not accelerate further as the core fundamentals in the environment deteriorate?\nDaniel T. Henry: We certainly have a very good window within the quarter about what\u2019s taking place, not only month by month, but day by day and we can see what the trends are and from that we can have a window a little bit into the next month or two. What\u2019s going to happen beyond that is going to be very dependent on what customers\u2019 view of the economy is as opposed to our view of the economy.  So it\u2019s really going to be their behaviors that are going to impact it. We have a little bit of a window, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a long term window that expands to the third quarter or the fourth quarter. On that basis, all of the decision we make we take into consideration everything that we know, but we don\u2019t have an economist in house and we\u2019re really picking a scenario around which we plan and then we have contingency plans either up or down around that.  In terms of credit losses, as I said, the launch is higher than the average. We have a view of what\u2019s going to happen in the second quarter because of roll rates in terms of what\u2019s being placed there, most likely to happen in the second quarter, but once you get beyond that it gets a lot more difficult because if you\u2019re going to have high delinquencies out there, it\u2019s going to be based on the behavior of the customers that are currently either current or 30 days and only time will tell what their performance is actually going to be.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: The bigger wild card is spending and the shortness of your, if it goes beyond 30 days do you know where it\u2019s going?\nDaniel T. Henry: In the very near term we know where it\u2019s going. We certainly also listen to all the external information that\u2019s out there and what economists are predicting. But as we know today there are one group of economists that have a very dire forecast and there\u2019s another set of economists that think the slowdown is only going to last for a short period of time. It\u2019s hard to figure out which is actually going to be the case.\nOperator: There are no other questions in queue.\nDaniel T. Henry: Let me just share a few final thoughts before we sign off which is despite the more difficult environment we generated strong business growth during the quarter and metric performance is in the top tier of the industry. While we continue to be cautious about the US economy we believe we are prudently balancing risk against profitability and growth.  Our goal is to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging conditions and emerges on a stronger footing relative to the competition.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ron Stovall. \nRon Stovall: As usual, it is my responsibility to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s press release which was filed in an 8K report and in the company\u2019s 20\u201908 10K report already on file with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  In the fourth quarter 2009 earnings release and earning supplement on file with the SEC in an 8K report as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.AmericanExpress.com. We have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.  Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents and provide some brief summary remarks. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one has actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: I\u2019ll start on Slide Two. So while revenues and income are well below our pre-recession levels, they are heading in the right direction and represent the highest levels that we\u2019ve achieved this year. So look at total revenues net of interest expense came in at $6.5 billion, about equal with the amount in the fourth quarter of \u201808. On an fx adjusted basis we\u2019d be down about 4%. If you compare this to the third quarter year-over-year on a reported basis we were down 16%. So being approximately even with last year is a significant improvement. Income from continuing operations was $710 million, up 132% from the prior year but we identified two significant items in last year\u2019s result, a reengineering charge as well as an MR related item. If you were to normalize from those, we were really up modestly about 5% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201808. Diluted EPS from continuing operations came in at $0.59 and return on equity was 14%.  Moving to Slide Three, you can see that billed business came in at $172 billion, up 8% on a reported basis and 4% on an fx adjusted basis. Again comparing it to the growth rates we had in the third quarter, reported billed business was down 11% and on an fx adjusted basis was down 9%. So again, a significant improvement compared to the third quarter and this improvement is really across all business lines as you\u2019ll see in a few minutes and it\u2019s the first positive growth rate that we\u2019ve had since the third quarter of \u201808. Cards in force came in at $87.9 billion and that\u2019s down 5% from last year. If you normalize to exclude the 3.3 million inactive cards that we cancelled this year, we would be down about 1%. Average basic card member spending was up 15% but if you were to normalize to exclude the inactive cards that I just referred to and adjust for fx we\u2019re up about 5% which is a strong rebound from the prior quarter.  Managed loans continue to be well below \u201808 levels. You can see that it\u2019s down 14% on a managed basis, although we did increase sequentially compared to the third quarter by about 2% and this is based on higher spending in our co-brand portfolio. Travel sales, while still down also improved, they are down 5%. That compares with 29% in the third quarter. We move to Slide four, this is more on billings. If you look at the bars, they represent the dollar amount of monthly billings and the lines represent the year-over-year growth on both a reported and fx basis. You can see that in the May to September time frame of \u201809, billings stabilized at about $52 billion per month and billings have now moved higher in October, November, and December.  Now the growth rate is benefitting from easier comparisons as we saw drops in billings in the fourth quarter of \u201908 but it\u2019s also benefitting from higher levels of billed business. The growth rate comparison actually improved month-by-month in the quarter. So the growth rate in November was better than the growth rate in October and the December growth rate was stronger than what we saw in November. Now the month of December \u201809 was the highest billed business month in AXP history on an fx adjusted basis. I point out that Global Commercial Services was particularly strong in December, up 13% on an fx adjusted basis. Just a little bit about holiday spending, so in the month of December US retail shops was up about 5% year-over-year, US department stores was flat and if you look at US online spending it was up about 11% and within that US retail online spend was up about 8%. So if you compare that to the industry which according to comScore was up about 4%, we fared a little bit better than the industry.  So moving to Slide Five, here we\u2019re looking at a percentage change on a year-over-year basis on an fx adjusted basis. So you can see that billed business really across all segments has improved from the third quarter. USCS and ICS are flat year-over-year and Global Commercial Services is up about 3% on an fx adjusted basis. G&S which is spending on cards issued by our partners was up about 22%. Geographically outside the US we saw the strongest growth in Latin America with JPAA being next so really broad based improvement across all of our business lines. If you move to Slide Six, this is a network perspective. Now the blue line represents number of transactions and the light blue line represents transaction size and the green line is total spend. So, both in number of transactions and the transaction size had positive growth in the quarter. Number of transactions grew 3% and transaction size increased by 2%. Now if you compare that again to the third quarter, transactions in the third quarter were actually down 1% and transaction size was down about 11%. If you look at it geographically, average [rock] size in the US was down about 2% and international was up about 14% year-over-year. Now if you look at the trend in the growth in the number of transactions for the quarter, as I said it was up about 3%, October was about flat and the month of December was actually up about 5%, so a good trend.  If we move to Slide Seven, we\u2019re looking at charge card billed business compared to receivable growth. The solid line represents the growth in billed business, the dotted line in card member receivables. So charge card billed business and receivable growth continues to move in tandem. You can see that we have an upward trajectory in billed business and charge card had positive growth in the quarter of 6% and AR was growing in line with billed business. We move to Slide 11, this is lending billed business versus loan growth. The solid line is billed business again and the dotted line represents loan growth. So historically spending on lending products and loan balances have correlated pretty closely. However, in the fourth quarter, spending has improved significantly with growth of about 2% year-over-year, driven by our premium lending focus on co-brand cards, but loans while up sequentially from the third quarter by $1.1 billion is lower than the fourth quarter of \u201808 by 14%.  Now some of the contributing factors to this separation is that we are having higher pay down rates and these statistics are actually based on our trust data. So the pay down rate in December of \u201809 was 26.9% and that compares with 23% in December of \u201808. Now this is certainly being impacted in part, by the change in the mix of the products as we focus on premium lending. It\u2019s also being impacted by the credit actions that we\u2019re taking which are focusing on limiting high balance accounts in the lending portfolio and this is having an impact on total loans. In addition to that, BTs which used to be a source of growth are basically a zero and lending card acquisition is at lower levels and that also historically has contributed to the growth in loans. Now if we move to Slide Nine, this is our US Card Services net interest yield on a managed basis. Now at the bottom of the chart, you can see certain of the factors that are impacting the yield in each quarter. Now the fourth quarter \u201809 net interest yield is similar to the two prior quarters but there really are a number of things that are taking place. So we\u2019ve had some increases in pricing which has a positive impact on yield but there are various aspects that are reducing yield. One is the card member assistance programs we have where we forgive interest. That\u2019s having a negative impact on yield. Now we\u2019re focused on premium lending so the revolve rate is dropping, also impacting yield and then also the credit actions that we\u2019re taking are having an impact.  In addition to that, we\u2019re starting to see some of the impacts from the Credit Card Act affecting yield. Now we expect that the Credit Card Act will bring net interest yield down from \u201809 levels as we move into 2010. So I\u2019m not making a forecast here, but I think in the future it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll move to the historical levels that we saw in the \u201906 to \u201808 time frame when you look at it on a managed basis. So moving to Slide 10, we\u2019re looking at revenue. Total revenues as I said were flat, on an fx adjusted basis, they\u2019re down about 4%. So discount revenue is up about 5%. That\u2019s a combination of billed business increasing at 8% and our average discount rate decreasing by two basis points year-over-year to 2.51%. Net card fees continue to be a strong story despite the weak economy. So clearly if you have the right value proposition, card members continue to renew on our fee-based products which is a positive. If you look at that interest income and securitization, that\u2019s down about 7%. Net interest income decreased by 8% and averaged owned loans were down 26% partially offset by higher yield compared to the fourth quarter of \u201808. Securitization income is down 5% primarily driven by a decrease in interest income. Other revenues are down 12% driven primarily by lower delinquency fees which are a result of lower owned loans and the impact of various customer assistance programs. Moving to Slide 11, this is a first in a series of slides on credit. Provision is significantly lower in the fourth quarter of \u201809 compared to \u201908, down 47%. Both charge card and card member lending are making a large contribution. Charge card improved by 67% driven by improved write off rates and lower past due rates. Card member lending provision decreased by 40% due to average owned loans decreasing by 22% year-over-year and lower levels of past due accounts. I would note that sequentially compared to the third quarter, the lending provision decreased by 43% as write offs of past dues improved. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in a few slides. So moving to Slide 12 looking at our expenses, marketing and promotion was up 36% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201808 and up 41% on a sequential basis or $200 million compared to the third quarter of \u201809. So the increase in marketing and promotion and other increases in investment spending has been enabled by the increase in card member spending and credit indicators showing further signs of improvement. So M&P is at higher levels really across all of our businesses and if we now stop and look at rewards, you can see that that\u2019s up 8%. Now if we exclude a Delta related charge in MR that we had last year, this slide is up 18% and this is being driven by higher card member spending as well as higher co-brand expenses in the period. Now on this chart, you see that S&B is improved by 28% but if you exclude net reengineering costs in both periods then S&B would decrease by 8% reflecting the lower employee levels that we have this year compared to last. Other operating expenses increased and this reflects higher spending on credit and collections, investment spending in higher technology and related costs and a charge to exit certain real estate properties this quarter. Moving to Slide 13, so here we\u2019re looking at marketing and promotion expense by quarter and you can see that the fourth quarter is significantly higher than the other quarters in this past year. The marketing and promotion is focused on charge card, co-brand products, brand advertising, receptions of coverage, product development and gift cards. All of these investments are on strategy for us. So if we move to Slide 14, we\u2019re looking at charge card write offs and 30 day past due rates as it relates to the US Consumer Services segment. Now this is really a start of a drill down on credit that will cover a number of slides but you can see that USCS write off rates and past dues have improved significantly compared to both the fourth quarter of \u201808 and the third quarter of this year. Both are contributing to the lower provision levels that we have and these metrics are really at historic lows. If we move to Slide 15 and look at charge card net loss rates and 90 day past dues for our international consumer, business and Global Commercial Services, you can see here that the net loss ratios and the 90 day past dues are also performing very well. So in charge card really has performed well across all three units the US consumer, international consumer, and Global Commercial Services have performed well not only in this quarter but really all year. So the charge card provision for the full year of 2009 is down 37% compared to the full year of 2008 and it\u2019s a very good story. So we now move to Slide 16, charge card reserve coverage. So, now the provision in the fourth quarter of \u201809 and for the full year of 2009 are lower than 2008, you can see that the reserve coverage across all of the business units are up slightly compared to last year and reserves we think reflect the inherent risk in our portfolio. Now let me move to lending in Slide 17. So this is lending managed net write off rates and this is the second quarter in a row that managed debt write off rates have improved. Now the improvement is being affected by a broad range of credit and business actions as well as the environment. These actions include really enhanced credit and collection policies and practices and in particular by our efforts to limit the number of high balance lending accounts which is having a large impact in bringing write offs down. Higher write offs in the second quarter of this year were really contributing to the higher write offs that we saw in Q209. It\u2019s also benefitting from our focus on premium lending. So let me move to Slide 18. This metric is important as we look forward and you can see that the managed 30 day past dues are improving in the US consumer business as well as international consumer. Within the US the states that were hardest hit such as California and Florida, while still at higher delinquency rates than the average, are improving at a slightly faster rate. So let me move to Slide 19. This is a slide that we have focused on quite a bit over the last several quarters and if we look at the upper left chart which is current to 30 day past dues and you look at the yellow triangles which are July, August, and September, this is what will lead to write offs in the first quarter of 2010. You can see that they are similar to the prior three months which drove write offs in the fourth quarter of \u201809. So if the 30 day past due to write off rate stays unchanged and recoveries and bankruptcies remain constant, it would imply that the first quarter of 2010 write offs will be similar to the fourth quarter of \u201809. This is not a forecast, but if these assumptions were to take place that\u2019s what we would see. Now if you\u2019ll look at the green triangles, these will write off in the second quarter of 2010. Now assuming the same caveats that all the other factors remain the same, it would imply slightly lower 2Q 2010 write offs than what we saw in the fourth quarter. But again, this is not a forecast it\u2019s simply based on those assumptions. You can also see on the right of this chart, the bankruptcy filings have remained constant over the last three months. So let me move to Slide 20. This provides a trend by month in the USCS managed lending credit metrics. So write offs in the fourth quarter were 7.5%. If you look at it by month, in October it was 7.8%, November it was 7.6%, and December it was 7.1% so an improving trend. Now the 30 past due that we site for the quarter is really a month end number for December, so that\u2019s a 3.7%. But again, we have a positive trend in that 30 past due at the end of October was 4.1%, end of November was 3.9%, and December was 3.7%. So we\u2019re seeing improvement quarter-over- quarter and really a positive trend within the fourth quarter. So write off rates here are still very high on a historic basis and therefore they continue to have a negative impact on our P&L. The forecast is for unemployment to stay at relatively high levels and if this were true, it would obviously have an impact on the ability of these credit metrics to improve in the future so we need to keep that in mind. So moving to Slide 21, this is lending provision compared to write off. So the dark bars are provision by quarter and the light bars are write off dollars by quarter. So the trend, going back to the first quarter of \u201807 is that the amount of the dollars or provision have been higher than the amount of write offs. So the fourth quarter of \u201809 is really the first quarter where provision is not higher than the amount of write offs and that reflects the lower write off rates and the improvements that we\u2019ve seen in the 30 day past due amounts. Notwithstanding that we remain cautious about the environment in that it still remains uncertain. So let us go to Slide 22 and look at our lending reserve coverage. Here you can see that the US card services and worldwide reserve metrics and even with provision in the fourth quarter lower than the write off files that we saw on the prior slide, we think that we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage given the inherent risk in our portfolio. You can see that most reserve coverage ratios are either similar or slightly higher than the amounts we had in the third quarter of this year. So moving to Slide 23, these are our capital ratios compared to regulatory benchmarks. You can see that the capital ratios are all either the same or slightly higher than the third quarter. They\u2019re all above the well capitalized current benchmarks. Both the actuals for the fourth quarter and the pro forma for the fourth quarter which assume that securitizations, loans that were securitized came back onto the balance sheet as of the end of December. As you know, securitized loans are scheduled to come back onto the balance sheet in the first quarter of next year. So again, both on an actual and a pro forma basis it\u2019s well above the current benchmarks. I would point out that our Tier-1 common ratio is among the best in the industry. If we move to Slide 24, this is a liquidity snapshot. Here as in other quarters, you can see that liquidity continues at a level where we\u2019re holding excess cash and marketable securities at a sufficient level to cover the next 12 months of maturity. So excess cash and securities are $26 billion and funding maturities over the next 12 months are $20 billion.  Moving to Slide 25, this is a chart on our retail deposit program. As you can see we continue to grow deposits. We grew deposits by $2.4 billion in the third quarter. If you look at the retail CDs that we raised in the fourth quarter, the average duration was 23 months and the average rate was 1.4%.  So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Given the difficult environment over the past year and a half, we have focused on the basics of staying liquid, staying profitable, and investing selectively for growth. We leveraged the competitive strengths of our diversified business model to deliver on the first two of these priorities and have increasingly been shifting to a higher level of investments. Over the last six months improved credit trends, the benefits of our reengineering initiatives, and more recently somewhat better card member spending levels enabled us to invest in initiatives designed to position the company for growth over the moderate to long term.  Areas of focus for these investments include our premium lending products like our Delta, British Airways, Starwood, and Costco programs. Our more pro active charge card product and marketing efforts, merchant acceptance around the globe, G&S partner related product launches and signing efforts, corporate service product offerings and expense management services, brand building initiatives in the US and selected international markets, expanding our data and information management capabilities. And while still in the early stages of forming our enterprise growth unit, last week we closed the acquisition of Revolution Money, our first initiative within this unit.  Now certainly it is too early to say that all the economic challenges are behind us, but we have seen some encouraging signs of progress over the last several months. We expect the global economy to continue to recover gradually and the resulting environment to be characterized by billing\u2019s growth that is more modest than we experienced before the recession as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending. In addition, unemployment levels are forecasted to remain relatively high. Without job creation, credit metrics can only improve so far from the still relatively high current level. Lastly, increase regulation could further impact profitability.  In light of these challenges, it is more important than ever to invest in initiatives that will position American Express to sustain growth and to continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. As such, our priorities in 2010 are to drive growth, drive efficiency, and deliver superior service. More specifically, while credit did turn positive for us in 2009, most company\u2019s including us drove 2009 earnings by reducing expenses. In 2010 and beyond, it will be important to us to grow revenues as well as earnings. At the same time, we plan to have a closed structure that can help produce good returns and fuel investments even in a slower growth environment. Finally, service will be more important as a differentiator during these uncertain times when customers are looking for companies they can trust and rely on. We believe American Express has the right products and services to be successful in this new economy. We are confident because our business model comprises a diverse set of activities that span the payment industry, our brand is a unique asset that is recognized and respected around the globe, our premium card member base remains a key advantage in retains the capacity to growth spending substantially as the economy improves. Our Global Merchant Network is positioned to capitalize on many future growth opportunities that are resident within the payment industry our capital planning has anticipated the 2010 consolidation of off balance sheet receivables and we\u2019re focused on maintaining a capital funding and liquidity profile that is appropriate to these following times.  Lastly, we believe we have a set of winning strategies which position us to both capitalize on our core business opportunities today and evolve toward the emerging payments opportunities of the future. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: I had a couple questions, the first was could you comment on what you\u2019ve seen through January in terms of spending on a year-over-year basis? Have the gains that you saw in the fourth quarter held through January? While I know seasonally, it\u2019s down month- on-month but year-on-year, how does that look? \nDaniel T. Henry : The year-over-year growth that we\u2019ve seen through the 20th of January is similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: In terms of the marketing spend, if you look at the total costs of marketing and promotion, card member rewards and card member services, as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter it was much higher than I\u2019ve seen it at any other point in your history basically. I was wondering if you could give us sort of your outlook for the marketing spend and the card member rewards? In \u201910 should we expect to see marketing be materially higher? What type of run rate should we expect and will there be additional marketing costs around the Olympics?\nDaniel T. Henry : What I would say when we get to a steady state which I don\u2019t think is going to be 2010 but sometime beyond that, I would think marketing expenditures would be a similar percentage. I don\u2019t know of any reason for that not to be the case. Although I would say in a period where we are seeing improvements in billing and improvement in credit we\u2019re going to be very focused on using those dollars really to invest for the medium to long term in a very similar way we did back in 2001 and 2002. We view this as really an opportunity to grow the business so we will continue I would think in 2010 to invest heavily to support that future growth.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: And around the Olympics will there be any kind of pull forward?\nDaniel T. Henry : I don\u2019t see us doing anything beyond what we would normally do around that time. I guess the other thing that I would want to point out though is investment spending is not just marketing and promotion. When we invest to grow global commercial services most of those investments will not be on the M&P line. The same is true in merchant services and it is certainly true to the extent we\u2019re investing in and building capabilities. So marketing and promotion is a line that gives you an idea of what we\u2019re doing in investing but you\u2019ll see our investments come through in other lines including other operating expense.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: And when you decide on that marketing budget what is the time frame you are looking at in terms of returns whether it is through billed business or whatever metric you are using to gage that?\nDaniel T. Henry : Each type of investment has a different time frame in terms of the returns but certainly the investments we make are driven generally to look at the life time profitability of either bringing on a set of consumers, a set of small businesses or investing in sales force to enable our commercial services or our merchant business. So, it is really a lifetime payback that we\u2019re looking at for the investments that we make each year.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods : Just a quick question Dan on the net interest margin, you mentioned we could expect the margin to kind of revert back to \u201906 \u201908 levels I believe. Just so I\u2019m thinking about this correct, come February 22nd when the Card Act is implemented we should see a down draft in the margin, right? Is there a rough estimate you can kind of help us think about as far as the margin -implications at that point in time?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think it will be a down draft that probably takes several quarters because some aspects of the Card Act come in to effect in February, others come in to effect later in the year. Actually, by referring you back to \u201906 and \u201908 I was trying to give you an idea of where we might migrate to. But, the impact of the Card Act on yields will actually take place over a couple of quarters.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods : Just so I understand it, come February 22nd there will be people that go delinquent that you can\u2019t reprice for 105 days, right?\nDaniel T. Henry : Correct.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods : Then the other question was on capital management, is there a point in time that we could start to see the share buyback program be implemented again and what would you need to see?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think one thing we would like to have a better sense on is just where regulators are going to be coming out in terms of where they want to set capital levels. Now, to the extent we get guidance of that sometime in the near term then that will be useful. If it is going to take [inaudible] return that we\u2019re going to have to kind of pick a spot for ourselves. I would say we will see what earnings are like. I wouldn\u2019t say that share buybacks are in the imminent future but some point in the future we\u2019ll have to make a decision about the level of capital that we want to hold. We want to hold capital to kind of move to the higher levels that we\u2019re expecting for a regulatory purpose, we also want to support the growth in our business but I think we also want to have the capacity to do bolt on acquisitions which are smaller acquisitions to help achieve our strategy.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : I\u2019d like to drill on a little bit more on the card member rewards line. If you look at card member rewards over the long term, as long as you\u2019ve given us that data it has generally been running around 29% to 30% of the discount revenue. It jumped way up there this quarter. Is there anything unusually in that item? I see you market a lot of triple points and some things like that, is there some special marketing in there or have you adjusted your marketing? Are the redemptions higher? What\u2019s going on there and is the 32% the right number long term or is the historical 29% more correct?\nDaniel T. Henry : I would say that there are a couple of small items in there that are unique for the quarter but I would also say that as co-brands become more of a focus they do have a higher rewards cost than membership rewards. I\u2019d also point out that in the fourth quarter of last year we bumped up our membership rewards reserve as a result of our contract with Delta. So that fourth quarter adjustment was to true up our reserve but on an ongoing basis there\u2019s a higher cost related to that. So I think it is a combination of a few small unique items in the quarter as well as some higher rewards costs that we\u2019ll see on a go forward basis.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Obviously you are marketing a lot more than you were I mean it\u2019s hard to turn on the TV and not see an Express commercial. Now historically we would expect to see relatively quickly an effect on the card growth. That historically has been a very good measure of the effectiveness of your marketing, the card growth and the spending per card but your total cards outstanding are still declining. What do you expect in that regard and should we not be judging the success of your marketing by cards outstanding at this point?\nDaniel T. Henry : I have this observation, certainly to the extent that we\u2019re doing brand advertising we think there\u2019s a real benefit to that and you\u2019ve probably noticed that during the first two or three quarters of this year we had that at very low levels and we wanted to bring that back. I think there\u2019s some sustained level we want to have over time and there\u2019s a real benefit to that. On the other hand there\u2019s not a specific change in cards in force. I guess the other point that I would make out is to the extent we are more focused on premium lending in charge card you are going to not see the same kind of pop in cards in force when we bring up marketing you would have seen if we were bringing proprietary lending cards. So to acquire higher spending costs a lot more dollars and you get fewer cards but they have a good long term benefit and they are very much in line with our strategy. So you may see a different correlation in terms of the growth in cards in force to our marketing dollars. We also are using a fair amount of our marketing dollars to invest in some of our other businesses whether it be commercial services or our merchant business. So I think you just need to calibrate your thinking a little bit based on the strategy that we\u2019re employing as we go forward here.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Last question, I just wondered if you could give a little bit of a comment on Revolution Money? I haven\u2019t seen any clear financials for Revolution Money but indications are that there\u2019s technology there but not a lot of P&L income statement and it seems like you paid a lot relative to what you got initially. Can you give us a little more color on your thoughts around Revolution Money and what are the key drivers and how can we get some feel for what kind of success you\u2019re having with that investment?\nDaniel T. Henry : Let me just do an addendum to my prior answer which I think is relevant. So while we haven\u2019t seen out of our marketing dollars a pop in cards in force we did see very good growth in billed business so that marketing and the stimulation we did paid off and I think our growth in billed business is really differentiated from the competition. So I think we are getting good returns on the increase in marketing promotion that we did. As it relates to Revolution Money we only closed last week so it is a little early to talk about what\u2019s actually taking place. But to your point it is a capability in large measure that we were acquiring as opposed to a large revenue and income stream but we think they have terrific capabilities that we can build upon and I think it is important for us to continue to look at alternative payments because while they may not be large next quarter, over time we think it\u2019s an area where we need to continue to invest because over time we do think it is going to be relevant in the payments market. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities. \nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: If you could just help us dissect the billed business number a bit more. We saw some evidence during the fourth quarter of some high end retailers experiencing some stronger year-over-year sales growth versus some lower end retailers. Can you help us understand the extent to which the growth in billed business is really being driven by the affluent customer base versus lower spending customers? Can you just give us some color on that?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think as we pointed out in the slides the improvement was really across all our business lines which I think is very positive and geographically it was broad based as well so I think that is a positive as well. I think [Ed Gilligan at the Financial Community Meeting is going to drill down on exactly where we saw some of the spending benefits so I think you\u2019ll get more details at that juncture. But, my sense is that by different spend levels of customers we saw again a broad based improvement in spending across all the categories. As I said, I think [Ed Gilligan will give more detail at the Financial Community Meeting.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: You also mentioned that you continue to see both near consumers and businesses kind of hold back a bit on spending but is there any sign at all or do you see any kind of early signs within corporate spending of whether some of the scaling back that business had done on travel and things like that where there may be some early signs of that kind of turning the corner a bit?\nDaniel T. Henry : Corporate card commercial services has historically functioned more as a V, it usually holds on longer in a slowdown, drops more sharply and then comes up sharper than the rest of the business. You can see that on Slide Four in terms of totality and by business on Slide Five. But again, this time I think we\u2019re seeing the same thing I think commercial services came back sharper than the rest of the businesses. As I pointed out in December their fx adjusted growth was actually 13% so we are seeing good improvement in the month of December in spending by corporations.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: Then finally could you comment on the American Express Business Insights group and just developments there and what we can expect from that in terms of your growth expectations going forward?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think as we talk about looking for new revenue sources to help drive revenues and profits we think this is an area that has a lot of opportunity. I think we actually launched it, [Bill Glenn did last month with a presentation but really I think it is building on our close loop, it\u2019s building on our data management capabilities in terms of providing insights to merchants in terms of their marketing and other business decisions that they need to make so we actually think this is one of those new revenue sources which will help in the future growth of the company.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: My questions all relate to credit and I\u2019m trying to figure the turn in credit out and what your specific guidance on credit is. So, given the fact that you said a couple of things that you\u2019re credit metrics are clearly improving but the persistent unemployment will weigh on that so how do you reconcile both? Do you need a pickup in employment? If employment worsens what happens to credit? Can you sort of map that out more?  Then a general question which is why do you think credit is improving with such a persistently high unemployment rate? Is it burnout? What could lead to an improvement in credit or another leg down in credit beyond unemployment? And, should we just be looking at initial claims?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think we have certainly outpaced the industry here in terms of credit performance over the last two quarters and we think that is a result of actions that we have taken. We have been very focused on enhancing our credit and collection practices which are helping quite a bit. That was in that because we are providing assistance to some customers and waiving some fees, we\u2019re seeing the impact of that in our yield numbers but you\u2019re also seeing a benefit of that within the metrics of write offs and delinquencies. We think that is a smaller part, we really think it is the other credit and collection activities that we have which is having the larger impact.  The other significant thing that we have done is we are very focused on high balance accounts. So in the early part of this year where our write off rate was really moving up and really moving up and really moving from being best in class to being the middle of the pack. A major factor that is affecting that is that the average write off amount had grown and we\u2019ve been very focused to bring that down and we think that\u2019s having a real positive impact in the write off rate in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So I think we\u2019ll continue to be focused on that as we go forward. Those are some of the things that we\u2019ve done that I think has enabled us to distinguish ourselves from the industry and as I pointed out if you follow the chart with the triangles, it will give some insight about what is going to take place next year. But, I do want to be very clear that what\u2019s going to happen longer term and even what\u2019s going to happen in the first and second quarter of next year is going to be driven by what takes place in the economy broadly but particularly in unemployment. You really do need at some point to have job creation here to really help credit metrics improve over a longer period and really get back to the historic levels that we\u2019ve seen.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: If I could just ask a follow up, I forget which investor presentation it was, I think it was the summer of 2007 where you really honed in on limiting credit to certain states which were impacted the most by declines in housing. What are the variables on credit that are the guide posts for you making line decisions, etc. today?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think it is the combination of the factors that we\u2019ve always looked at but over the last 18 months we\u2019ve also been very focused on integrating additional information in to our models to help us make better decisions. Also, increasing the frequency with which we update the information within the models so we\u2019re constantly striving to improve and enhance how we can identify people who are going to default in the future. So it is really an ongoing process that we think we\u2019ve made good progress on recently and we\u2019ll continue to strive to make further progress on. Now, next time there\u2019s a slow down whether housing is a big factor or not we\u2019ll have to wait and see. The other thing I would say is it is not reading all the factors exactly the same for every group of customers. For charge card high spenders there may be certain aspects that get higher weighting than for customers that say spend at a lower level. We actually have this refined by product and by spend level as we constantly strive to enhance the accuracy of our predictions.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: Can I just follow up with one last question, I promise it is my last one. I know you went through the number of transactions but are you finding that a smaller group of your customers are spending more and using the card more or is it broad based within your entire customer base?\nDaniel T. Henry : We think it is broad based not only by segment but also within consumer we think it is broad based across different spending levels as well and it is also broad based geographically.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.\nJason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Just a follow up on Meredith\u2019s question, on credit do you believe that the more traditional correlations than between charge offs and unemployment will be the trend we should expect here ahead versus the continued divergence in trend?\nDaniel T. Henry : When we\u2019ve talked about correlations we\u2019ve always talked about there\u2019s a pretty tight correlation between GDP and billings but when you try and correlate credit and unemployment historically they\u2019ve kind of moved directionally over time in the same direction but the correlation has not been nearly as tight. I think if you went back to either \u201991 or 2001 the improvement in unemployment actually lagged the improvement in industry write off rates by about three quarters. So there is a correlation but it is not nearly as tight as we see in other areas.\nJason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Just one quick follow up, now that we\u2019ve moved further through the down turn here and signs of stability in your business are more or less emerging here, I was wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on your outlook for return on equity? I think the last guide was about 20% but maybe when we get in to 2011, 2012 do you kind of have something in your mind to update us with?\nDaniel T. Henry : We\u2019ve been holding off in setting new ROE targets until we had a better sense of what regulatory requirements would be for capital levels and if we get that guidance within the next quarter or two we will quickly set our ROE target. So I guess I would also commit that even if we don\u2019t get that guidance we will make an assumption and come out with guidance by say the middle of the year.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Michael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP.\nMichael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP: Just looking at Slide Four I was a little surprised US consumer billed business wasn\u2019t a little stronger but it looks like through the course of the quarter the gap between the reported number and the fx adjusted narrowed. Was that driven more by the fx rate or a little bit of the strengthening of the dollar in December or did the US consumer start to pick up more in December?\nDaniel T. Henry : I don\u2019t have specific knowledge about what fx did in November versus December although I would say it was coming in a little bit so that was probably helping to close that gap somewhat. As I said before I think we saw greater strength in December, greater strength in the average for the quarter so I think it was probably a combination of both.\nMichael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP: The driver behind the big jump in growth in the G&S segment, was there anything specific behind that?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think G&S has really been strong throughout the last five or six quarters and has constantly performed better than the rest of the businesses which I think reflects that our partners see value in putting cards that run on our network out to their customers so I think this is probably a continuation of that. It is also probably benefitting by the fact that we\u2019re putting new products out in the marketplace so a combination of all those activities are probably helping us. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I was wondering if you could spend a little more time on the lending margins? I noticed it was up a little bit in the quarter and you referenced the card member assistance program. I think you did some repricing in the quarter as well. I would have thought with the charge off rate coming down so significantly that you would have seen the card member assistance program while still a drag actually drag less on the margin in the fourth quarter.  Then you referenced also the Card Act and I think what you\u2019re referencing there is just the inability to do default rate repricing without giving 45 days notice to customers. I wasn\u2019t sure if you had any ability to quantify any of those impacts? You\u2019re giving a pretty broad range here for the margin \u201906 to \u201908 I think it was a lot higher in \u201906 than it was in \u201908 so just give me a little more color on what you saw in the quarter. I would think you\u2019d see some upward pressure on the margin that didn\u2019t appear this quarter and I\u2019m a little bit concerned that maybe default rate pricing was a bigger impact than I estimated.\nDaniel T. Henry : First of all this is net yields so write offs are not part of this calculation. This is the finance charge revenue that we\u2019re getting from customers less our cost of funds. So I guess there are a number of things that are taking place. First it was pricing that took place in the quarter but it only impacted a portion of the quarter so the full effect of the pricing you see in the first quarter you\u2019re only getting a piece of it in the fourth quarter. So if you put pricing in place in November you only get one month\u2019s worth of that benefit in the quarter.  The other things that were having an impact is to the extent we have programs that are providing assistance to card members that have temporary liquidity issues we\u2019re forgiving interest so that\u2019s obviously having an impact of brining yields down. The Credit Card Act is negatively affecting it but it is again to the issue that you said it is really our inability to reprice immediately. We actually have to give customers 45 day\u2019s notice so we\u2019re starting to see the impact of that in the quarter. But the more significant impacts as you are aware of the Credit Card Act will come to us in the first and second quarter of next year. It\u2019s really a variety of things moving in here. Now, it is also being impacted by the fact that to the extent we are more focused on premium lending, some of those customers tend to act more like transactors and so that is going to reduce our revolve rate which is also having an impact on yields. So all of these things are happening at the same time some were full quarter impacts, some are partial quarter impacts.  Now, I guess the other thing that I would say just in terms of the guidance I was giving, if you look at kind of the \u201906 to \u201908 time frame on a managed basis that averaged about 9% and that was really the direction in guidance I was looking to give. Again, this is not a forecast but in terms of trying to be helpful in terms of how you might think about it over the long term I think that\u2019s a pretty reasonable period to look at.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: One quick follow up if I may, I didn\u2019t quite catch if you said anything about lending balance growth, it obviously turned around a little bit this quarter seasonally I\u2019m sure. But, do you expect to grow the lending book in 2010?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think you\u2019re right the sequential growth of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter compared to the third was driven by seasonal spend and just higher spending levels year-over-year which was positive. As you can see from one of the slides there really was a break away in terms of spending from the loan balance and I think I went through the factors I thought were contributing to that including just our strategy focus on premium lending. My sense is over time the correlation between loan balance and spending growth will probably come back more in line but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if it took several quarters for that to actually take place.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citi.\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citi: Our understanding is the Card Act there is a clause to effectively look back at these rate increases from the issuers and I was just curious if this could have any impact and how you think the Fed might look at that? Will they just look at broadly all repricing or would it be just the really high risk? If you have any comments there?\nDaniel T. Henry : I\u2019m not aware that the law actually have a provision to do a look back but certainly there have been conversations in different forums of people alluding to whether that should be something that is considered so we will have to wait and see how that evolves over time. But, to my knowledge it\u2019s not in the law or the regulations but it something that people are thinking it is something that maybe an aspect that should be considered.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.\nJohn McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Just one more question around the messaging around the investment spend and trying to understand the ramp up messaging. So is it fair to think of it that you\u2019ve stepped up the investment spent in the third quarter and the fourth quarter as provision expense came down and perhaps at a new run rate but the idea is that it\u2019s going to go up further kind of dependent on the billed business recovery and further credit improvement and we\u2019re at a run rate that\u2019s higher but you\u2019re still going to look to invest more?\nDaniel T. Henry : Well, it\u2019s going to be very correlated to what takes place in billings and credit. To the extent that billings really moves up and credit improves then we could well spend above the levels we had in fourth quarter. But, if you look at fourth quarter compared to historical levels it was at some pretty high levels so we\u2019re not committing we\u2019re going to go higher or committing that it\u2019s going to come down. I think we\u2019re going to try and invest at a healthy rate in 2010 so that we can build momentum as we go in to 2011 but exactly where it comes out will be very calibrated by both billings and credit as it unfolds in 2010.\nJohn McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Then the decline in discount rate by about three basis points was partly due to seasonality and partly merchant mix shift. Any more color on how much is seasonality versus the shift?\nDaniel T. Henry : It certainly was seasonality from the third quarter to the fourth quarter it always drops because of holiday spending. Now, in most quarters over the last year or two we\u2019ve been dropping about one basis point year-over-year, this quarter if you compare the fourth quarter of \u201909 to the fourth quarter of \u201908 it dropped two basis points but we got to the point where there was some rounding involved so it was actually one point something that actually tipped us over to two basis points so I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual about the trend that is being driven by us. We\u2019re emphasizing every day spend and moving in to certain merchant categories which are at the lower end of the discount rate scale.\nJohn McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: So as we look in to next year I mean the primary driver will be kind of the mix of billed business and what\u2019s driving the billed business recovery?\nDaniel T. Henry : It will continue to be the mix of business as well as our value recapture initiatives to increase rates for those categories where we can clearly demonstrate we are providing increased value to the merchants. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.\nScott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: You mentioned the modification program, I was just wondering and you\u2019ll disclose absolute levels but I was wondering about recidivism rates if once you\u2019ve modified the borrowers do you see them falling delinquent again? If you have any type of information around that?\nDaniel T. Henry : We are very, very focused on any one who\u2019s received assistance and we are closing tracking. We assume that some of those customers once we help them out will be able to stay in the franchise and be customers for a long time. We also clearly recognize that some of those customers will not be able to comply with the agreement we have with them and will reage out. Now, they\u2019re performing very much in line or better than our expectations when we started the program. You can be sure that we\u2019re tracking them closely and we in fact have set up special reserves for this group of customers because they are clearly more risky than the broader set of customers. So they haven\u2019t gone in to delinquency or in some cases right off but we have higher levels of reserves set for this group of customers.\nScott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: On the repricing initiatives a lot of your peers are repricing as well but have you noticed any attrition on any accounts that get repriced? Are you seeing high amounts of attrition there?\nDaniel T. Henry : You would have thought because of the difficult economy that particularly on our fee based products that you would have seen a real jump up in attrition, non-credit attrition and we really haven\u2019t seen it. It really has been very modest which we think is a great sign for the franchise because people really see the value in the product even though they are paying a fee. The answer is we haven\u2019t really seen it either because of the economy and we really haven\u2019t seen it due to repricing initiatives that we did earlier in the year. Certainly the repricing we have done more recently we wouldn\u2019t have seen it yet but we did repricing earlier in the year and we really didn\u2019t see any notable uptick in attrition.\nScott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: Final question, the flip side of that, marketing spend is up, I assume solicitations are up, are you seeing a better response rate to those solicitations?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think we have many different channels that we use from mail to Internet to other methods so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any marked increase in response rates but certainly the response rates that we have on our investments are such that they are good economic investments. As we think about marketing investments over time when we get to a more normal period we want to get to marketing levels that are similar to what we had historically when you had an economy that was more normal.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital: On your page 24 Dan the maturities, can you just rank the relative cost of money now as securitizations mature can you go back to that market either based on a cost advantage or would you probably replace? You\u2019re showing here what your resources are but are you more likely to fund any growth with deposits or securitizations? And then, can you just remind us where long term unsecured debt costs are for you if you tried to go to market?\nDaniel T. Henry : We want to have a balance between unsecured, securitization and deposits over time. We think it is prudent to have as diverse a set of sources as we can have. When we get back to more normal markets and more normal spreads I think we will probably move between those three categories based on whatever is the most cost effective at that moment in time but I think we will always endeavor to have a substantial amount of funding coming out of all three of those. We had a slide in I think the August financial community meeting where we see, \u201cGee, if rates were the average that we\u2019ve seen over the last I think three years including the very high rates that we have had recently and we had to replace all the debt that matured between now and 2012 at that rate that it would increase our interest expense by I think $120 or $140 million.\u201d It would be slightly higher but certainly not dramatically higher than where we are.  But to your point, I think seeing how the unsecured markets and the securitization markets come back will be very important in terms of the spreads that we have to pay above benchmark. But, it is our intent to really use all three markets. Certainly recently we\u2019ve seen our CDS spreads come in really pretty dramatically over the last several months. So we\u2019ll see how long it takes to kind of get back to a more normal level but we would plan to use all three funding sources.\nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital: On page 23 where you show pro forma, what\u2019s your new allowance? The allowance increased by more than the reduction in capital correct?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think that we think the increase in the reserve will be about $2.5 billion and have about a $1.7 billion impact in reducing equity, approximately. \nBruce Harting \u2013 Barclays Capital: Did you comment on the administration tax if that applies to you or is it just too early to say?\nDaniel T. Henry : It is certainly early to say and we\u2019ll have to wait and see whether in fact it is passed by Congress or not. But, if it passed in the form that was described where you take your assets and you subtract deposits and you subtract Tier-1 capital the amount we would have to pay based on the December 31st balance sheet would be about $175 million on an annual basis. Some people have put estimates out there that are lower than that but you have to take in to consideration bring the securitized assets that are off balance sheet on to balance sheet. The $175 is a pretax amount.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Kenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Could you remind us on how you\u2019re thinking about reserve methodology and obviously you had a release this quarter. You look still very well reserved relative to where credit is trending but at some point I expect that you\u2019ll need to normalize that. Can you give us some sense to about how you\u2019re thinking about that please?\nDaniel T. Henry : We have a methodology that we constantly look at and look to refine periodically but basically it is looking at historical information to help us form a view of the inherent risk in the overall portfolio. Then we always step back and say are there certain aspects of the portfolio where we may need a specific reserve. What I described before relating to reaged accounts is a perfect example of that where we will identify that and look at an additional specific reserve. Then we\u2019re also very mindful of changes in either our strategy or the environment that we want to factor in, in terms of setting reserves. So at this juncture we are still concerned about the uncertainty in the environment and so we continue to be cautious in terms of how we set reserves. But, at the end of the day we\u2019re looking to set reserves that reflect the inherent risk in the portfolio. \nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just as a follow up recognizing that you don\u2019t want to give ROE guidance certainly on capital, would you be willing to give us an ROE target?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think as I said I\u2019m committed to even if we don\u2019t get regulatory guidance by the middle of this year we\u2019ll come out with guidance in terms of an ROE target.\nOperator:  Your final question comes from Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: This is pretty basic but putting the loans back on the balance sheet in the first quarter if I think about the P&L affect is it as simple as it seems? You put the loans on and you now are recognizing the interest income and expense? It seems like it would be provisions within a declining credit loss environment is probably accretive to your earnings. You no longer obviously get securitization income.\nDaniel T. Henry : Your basic point is exactly right we would expect to have no difference in pretax earnings but by bringing them back on we\u2019ll be recognizing net interest income, we\u2019ll be recognizing provision and so really we\u2019ll just be taking these and spreading what\u2019s now netted on securitization income and putting it back on the natural line items but there\u2019s no change to the bottom line.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: On late fees I guess that\u2019s one piece people are still waiting for and kind of guidance on what\u2019s a reasonable late fee. Do you have any feel for what to expect out of Washington in that regard?\nDaniel T. Henry : The answer to that question is no, we don\u2019t have any sense of whether we\u2019ll get any guidance or if we do when it will be. They certainly have passed a fair amount of legislation already that we\u2019re working hard to enable through our systems and if they come out with future guidance we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes but at this juncture we don\u2019t have any sense of any guidance about late fees.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Do you have any feel for timing as to when you will hear something?\nDaniel T. Henry : At this juncture no, we really don\u2019t have any sense of what will come or the timing of when it will come or if it will come.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Then the last thing, the charge that you took on real estate this quarter was how much?\nDaniel T. Henry : $63 million.\nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Pretax?\nDaniel T. Henry : Pretax, yes. Thanks everybody for joining the call and have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

John Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Investor Relations third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Stovall. Please go ahead.\nRon Stovall:  Thank you Gwen, and thanks to all of you for joining us for today\u2019s discussion.  As usual it\u2019s my responsibility to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intent, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expression are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s 2008 10-K report, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the third quarter 2009 earnings release and earnings supplement on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.  We have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.  Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings document and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one has actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry:  Thanks Ron. So I\u2019ll start with the slides and start on Slide 2, Summary of Financial Performance. So our revenues were slightly above $6 billion, down 16% from last year. That compares to being down 18% in the second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $642 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.54. Now included in the $0.54 is an FX item that I will discuss in a moment that increases EPS by $0.10. I recommend that you exclude this item in evaluating our operating results and think of our EPS from continuing operations as $0.44. Now if we go to Slide 3 we can see that this relates to our accounting for a net investment in foreign subsidiaries and the accounting for the related FX hedge. There\u2019s two pieces. One relates to a correction of prior period accounting with a cumulative catch-up in the third quarter, which is $135 million pretax or $85 million after tax. The second piece is the impact of the same item in the third quarter of \u201909, $45 million pretax, $82 million after tax, a combined $0.10. So a primary point that I want to make is that the FX exposure that we had was properly hedged and we have no economic gain or loss on this. Now let me explain the transaction that gave rise to this. We had a UK sub with equity of $1.2 billion, so basically a net asset. Now normally we hedge our exposures before we contract, but in this case we issued sterling debt. So we had an asset position, sterling debt and we had a good economic hedge. However, in September of \u201907 a portion of the debt matured and our system correctly identified that we had an FX exposure and so we went out and purchased a forward contract to hedge that position. Unfortunately the system identified it as a P&L exposure and therefore when we put the hedge on we designated it as a P&L hedge. And to the last two years the losses that were occurring in translation on our asset were offset in the P&L with gains on our forward contract, so basically net zero in our P&L.  Now we should have identified that exposure as a balance sheet hedge. So now we need to go back and correct that. And the losses that were incurred in the P&L we\u2019re basically reversing, creating income in the third quarter. Now normally you would think that the related item would also get corrected and there would be a zero impact. However, there are very specific rules in accounting related to foreign exchange hedges and you are not allowed to re-designate a hedge after its put in place. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving rise to this $180 million pretax. But again I want to emphasize that over the two year period we had a good economic hedge in place. And I would recommend that you exclude this when you think about our result and think about EPS as $0.44. So with that let me go to Slide 4, Metric Performance. Billed business was $156 billion. That\u2019s down 11% on a reported basis, 9% on an FX adjusted basis. In the second quarter we were down 13%, so we\u2019re showing some improvement. And in fact, in September on an FX adjusted basis we were down 7%. You can see cards in force are down 4%, but if you exclude the inactive accounts that we canceled, we would only be down 0.4%. If you look at average cardmember spending, it\u2019s down 3% and if you move down to loans and I think the right thing to do is look at managed loans were down 19%. But managed loans are decreasing at a faster rate than billings and this is due to the fact that acquisition of new cardmembers are lower than we have historically had due to the lower marketing spend in the first part of the year. And that remittance or the cash we were receiving from customers is exceeding each month the billed business volume plus the finance charges, and that\u2019s really a reflection of customers de-leveraging. If you look at sales, they continue to be significantly impacted by the economy. If we move to Slide 5 and we look at the blue bars, this is the dollar of billed business by month. If you look at the green line it\u2019s the year-over-year growth and the yellow line is the year-over-year FX adjusted growth. Now if you look on the right side you\u2019ll see since May our billed business has been pretty stable month-to-month at about $51 or $52 billion. Now the rate of billed business decline is moderating as the year-over-year comparisons are becoming easier. And if you go back to the left you can see in April of \u201908 last year, since then billings have been declining. So if billed business remained at $51 or $52 billion each month for the balance of the year, the rate of decline in the fourth quarter would be very low single digits or about flat year-over-year. Now that\u2019s not a forecast of what billings will be but just to give you an idea of what the growth rate might be. Turning to Slide 6, here you can see the number of transactions continues to hold up very well and you can see that in the third quarter of \u201909 transactions were about the same amount as they were in the third quarter of \u201908. What\u2019s really have going on is that you have lower transaction size and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving down total spending. The good news is that cardmembers continue to take their card out of the wallet and use it, reflecting the loyalty that cardmembers have to our products. If we move to Slide 7, this is the slide that we have shown for the last several quarters, and if you look at charge card a/r which is the dotted yellow line, its tracking pretty closely to charge spending which is the solid yellow line. Now you can also see that charge spending is improving or have a lower negative growth rate at a faster pace than spending on our lending products which is the blue solid line. And you can see that on the right side of this chart. Also you can see that loans continue to decrease, which is the blue dotted line, as lending product spend has flattened out. Now moving to Slide 8, our revenue performance, you can see that discount revenue is down 12%, in line with the decrease in billed business. Net card fees are only down 1% as cardmembers continue to value the premium products that we have in the marketplace. If you look at net interest and securitization income, we have lower securitization income primarily because of higher write-offs and lower net interest income due to lower loan balances. If you look at travel it continues to be negatively impacted by the economy. Looking at other revenues, this is driven lower by lower delinquency fees and the fact that the GE portfolio revenues last year were on the slide and as we migrated those to the AmEx network, those revenues are now up in discount revenue. Moving to Slide 9, provision for losses, you can see that we have lower charge card provision driven by lower write-off rates and a significant improvement in the 30 day past due levels as well as lower A/R. Lending is basically flat as higher write-off rates are offset by lower balances and improvements in the 30 day past due levels. I\u2019ll cover credit in more detail in a few slides. Looking at Slide 10, expense performance, you can see that marketing and promotion is down 22% from last year but it is up $150 million compared to the second quarter as lower provision has enabled us to increase our investment spending. Rewards has moved down with volume, as well as the benefit of us revising our redemption policy in MR related to 30 day past due accounts to make it more restrictive. Salaries and benefits down 14%, reflecting the reengineering that we have done over the past 12 months and other operating expense includes $180 million reduction related to the FX item I discussed earlier. Excluding that, other operating expense would have been down 8%. Moving to Slide 11, which is metric performance for our U.S. consumer business, you can see that billed business at $85 billion is down 13%. That compares with being down 16% in the second quarter and you can see that consumer is approving somewhat more quickly than small business. Now cards in force are down 11%. If you excluded the 2.7 million inactive cards that we canceled that would have been down about 5%. And again that reflects the fact that we had lower marketing spend in the early part of the year. Average spend is down 3% and that\u2019s a notable improvement from being down 12% in the second quarter. The terms of cardmember loans, I think it\u2019s important to look at managed and again you can see that we\u2019re having a decrease in loans greater than the decrease in lending spending. And again that\u2019s due to lower acquisitions and the fact that remittances are higher than the billed business and finance charges in the quarter. And again travel sales are negatively impacted by the economy. If we go to Slide 12, which is the metrics for our international consumer business, billed business at $24 billion is down 12% on a reported basis and 6% on an FX adjusted basis. And these continue to be better than what we see in the U.S. Now on a regional basis, Japan, Canada and Europe are all down about 7% and Latin America is actually up 2%. Cards in force which were down 7% if you excluded the 550,000 cards we canceled that were inactive, it would have been down about 4%. Average spend is basically flat and like the U.S. loans are decreasing faster than lending spend. If we go to Slide 13, metrics for our global commercial services, billed business is at $27.9 billion, down 14% on a reported basis, 11% on an FX adjusted basis. And this is a substantial improvement from the second quarter when we were down 18% on an FX adjusted basis. If you look at this split between the U.S. and outside the U.S., the U.S. is down about 10% and outside the U.S. is down 13% on an FX adjusted basis. In the regions outside the U.S., JPAA, Canada and Europe range from being down 12% to 16% on a FX adjusted basis and Latin America is actually up 7%. You can see the cards in force are up 1% and this is really the migration of the GE cards onto the AmEx network back in the first quarter of \u201908. And again here, travel sales are being negatively impacted by the economy. Moving to Slide 14, metrics for GNMS, you can see that we\u2019ve had a moderation in the decline in business both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. If you look at reported U.S. numbers, everyday spending is down about 10% and T&E spending is down about 14%. The discount rate continues to hold up reasonably well at 2.54%. Global network services billed business was 2% on a reported basis and 7% on an FX basis, which is strong growth. Cards in force grew primarily driven by existing partners, particularly in JPAA and Europe. Now moving to Slide 15, which is charge card net write-offs and 30 days past due, and you can see that the write-off rate in 30 day past due improved compared to the second quarter of \u201909 and in fact is lower than the third quarter of \u201908. So this is going to have a positive impact on our provision and it\u2019s a combination of the 30 day past due rate dropping from 2.6 in the second quarter to 2.2 in the third quarter. Also the fact that receivable balances have declined about 15% and write-off rates, write-off of dollar amounts are down. If we move to Slide 16 which is charge card net loss rates and 90 day past due in international consumer and global commercial, you can see that we are having some increase in the net loss ratio as a percentage of charge volume and both are up slightly compared to the second quarter. But very importantly, the 90 past due rates have improved compared to the second quarter and are better than the third quarter of \u201908. So the ICS and GCS provision is also benefiting from lower receivable balances as a result of our lower volumes. Turning to Slide 17 which is our lending managed net write-off rate. As you can see from the chart in the sector we have improvements across both units in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The managed U.S. write-off rate is at 9.8 compared to 10% in the second quarter and in fact was 8.4 in September. So while our AXP write-off dollars in the third quarter were $200 million higher than the third quarter of last year, they are $200 million lower than the second quarter of \u201909. And we expect the fourth quarter \u201909 write-off rate to be lower than the third quarter \u201909 write-off rate. Moving to Slide 18, which is lending managed 30 day past due and the 30 day past due is really a key indicator of future write-offs. So we had an improvement in the 30 day past due in both the U.S. and international consumer groups. This improvement is due in part to changes in our re-aging policies, enhancements in our collection practices and improvements in our decisioning models. Our lending write-off rates and 30 day past due rates have performed better than the industry this quarter. Now moving to Slide 19, so this chart we have showing the past and it\u2019s a useful chart as you think about future write-off rates. Now if you look at the upper left chart, which is the current 30 day past due chart and you look at the green triangles, these are the accounts that actually wrote-off in the third quarter. Now obviously how much writes off is also subject to the rate of accounts that moved from 30 days past due to write-offs. Okay? Now the improvement that we saw in the third quarter compared to the second quarter is very much attributable to the improvement that we saw earlier this year in the current to 30 day buckets. Now if we look at the yellow triangles, these are the group of accounts that we write-off in the fourth quarter, but again it will be subject to the movement in the rate of accounts that move from 30 days past due to write-off. And it\u2019s also the level of bankruptcies and recoveries will also be a factor in terms of what we see the actual write-off rate to be in the fourth quarter. So if we move to Slide 20, these charts are simply to give you an idea of the monthly depiction of what we saw in net write-off rates and the 30 day past due rates. And as you can see, both improved over the course of the third quarter. So let me move to Slide 21, which is our lending provision and the blue bars is the provision and the yellow bars are the write-offs in each quarter. Now the reason for this is that the economy remains uncertain, unemployment is predicted to stay stubbornly high, we have changed our re-aging policy which will have a positive economic impact for us but we are monitoring closely how the re-aging affects accounts that have been re-aged. We continue to be cautious in our provision, as you can see by the charts it\u2019s higher than our write-offs thereby increasing our reserves. So if we move to Slide 22, which is our lending reserve coverage, in the U.S. and worldwide we have increased our reserve coverage to reflect the inherent risk in our portfolio in these uncertain times. On the chart you can see the coverage in the U.S. as well as worldwide, and we consider these to be appropriate. Moving to Slide 23, these are our capital ratios. All of our capital ratios improved compared to the second quarter. All are above the benchmark rates for well capitalized, which you can see on the right side of the chart. In the industry there\u2019s much focus on capital and capital ratios once securitized loans come back on the balance sheet in the first quarter of 2010. Therefore we have provided a pro-forma ratio as if they have come back on the balance sheet at September 30. You can see that our capital ratios remain above the benchmarks and I point out that our tangible common equity to risk related assets is at 8.1%.  As we move to Slide 24, you can see that we continued to raise deposits and issue debt in the third quarter. Our cash now stands at $19 billion and as is our practice we adjust cash to back out our operating cash and short term outstandings, and then add in our liquidity investment portfolio. So our excess cash and readily marketable securities stands at $24 billion and this exceeds our expected maturities over the next 12 months. If you move to Slide 25, this chart shows you maturities by quarter over the next 12 months. Now you might note that our cash and marketable securities is at $25 billion and our 12 month maturities is at 18, and you may ask why we have the balance of cash and marketable securities so high. And the reason is in the fourth quarter we have a seasonal increase in billing and therefore an increase in accounts receivable loan balances. And we wanted to have a normal amount of funding in the fourth quarter and don\u2019t want to have an unusually high amount. So we\u2019ve built a higher liquidity position in the third quarter in anticipation of higher billings in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide [36], you can see detail on our deposit programs. We continue to build our retail CD\u2019s and they have an average maturity of 26 months. The average duration of retail CD\u2019s raised in the quarter was 21 months. Now retail savings accounts have increased and that\u2019s due to a signing of a new brokerage firm as an added distribution channel, direct deposits gathered through our personal savings program and increases from existing channels. Deposits now total $23 billion. So with that let me conclude with a few final comments. Given the difficult environment over the past year, our focus was towards the basics of staying liquid, staying profitable and investing selectively. While our operating results have been negatively affected through this period, we believe we have made progress on a number of fronts which should position us to emerge from this downturn in a stalwart and better position. Going forward our emphasis is transitioning towards investing in initiatives which will best position the company to grow over the moderate to long term. Our profitability in the quarter reflects the competitive strength of our diversified business model, where we play multiple roles in the payment issuer, processor and network provider.  While year-over-year spending comparisons remained negative during the quarter, monthly comparisons have recently improved as absolute spending levels have stabilized. This pattern is fairly consistent across all of our businesses and it is an encouraging sign of the potential to return to cardmember spending growth in the coming quarters. Credit trends continue to show overall improvement. Charge card losses have moderated in the United States over recent quarters and past due trends around the globe have improved. As expected, lending write-offs declined substantially in the quarter, although remain at historically high levels. Despite the decline, we increased reserves in light of the uncertain surroundings that time and the timing of ultimate improvement in unemployment and other economic trends.  Expense comparisons in the quarter continue to reflect the savings we have been able to achieve through two previously announced reengineering programs. However, as we discussed last quarter, our expenses also reflect the initial increase in business building investments. This additional spending became available through the better than planned credit trends experienced to date. Areas of focus for investments include a focus on our premium lending strategy, evidenced by the recent extension of our British Airways partnership and the continuation of investments in our Delta and Starwood partnerships, activities surrounding our proactive charge card product and marketing efforts, initiatives related to the expansion of our merchant acceptance around the globe, G&S partner related product launches and signing efforts, growth in our corporate services product offerings and expense management services, brand building initiatives in the United States and selected international markets, and activities surrounding our data and information management capabilities.  While there is still reason to be cautious about the impact of high unemployment levels, we expect to see sequential improvement in loan loss provision during the fourth quarter. Therefore we anticipate that we will release a greater level of incremental investments in the fourth quarter, which would further reduce the $1.5 billion of investment related savings that was originally targeted in our reengineering programs.  In closing, it\u2019s still too early to say that all of the economic challenges are behind us. We have seen some encouraging signs of progress over the last several months. However, while the global economy will recover, we do expect the resulting environment will be characterized by slower billings growth as consumers and business remain cautious about their spending. But we believe American Express has the right products and services for this new economy, including the ability to provide exceptional customer service. With our recent reorganization changes we believe the company will be better positioned to effectively lever its assets and resources and invest in those areas of the business that will strengthen our competitive position. We are confident because our business model comprises a diverse set of activities that span the payment industry, our brand is a unique asset that is recognized and respected around the globe, our premium customer base remains a key advantage and it retains the capacity to grow spending substantially as the economy improves. Our global merchant network is positioned to capitalize on the many future growth opportunities resident in the payments industry. Our capital planning has anticipated next year\u2019s consolidation of off balance sheet assets. And we\u2019re focused on maintaining a capital funding and liquidity profile that is appropriate for these volatile times.  And lastly, we believe we now have the ability to invest in a number of terrific opportunities for growth and set a winning strategy to capitalize on them. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Meredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory LLC.\nMeredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory LLC: My question is on obviously everyone\u2019s trying to get to continuity of earnings, core earnings, and as there\u2019s so much on the forefront in terms of changes and restructuring and the whole pricing schemes through businesses and the car business and up front fees, is there any glimpse in this quarter\u2019s numbers of how the pricing schemes may be changing? Or what quarter is that going to affect? And when do you imagine you will have a good view of a run rate going forward and what will be the catalyst that will trigger a more pronounced investment in marketing?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So as I think about it, even though we\u2019ve had improvement on the billings front where growth is less negative and we\u2019ve had improvement in our credit metrics, our credit metrics are still very high from a historic basis. And to get back to what would be more normalized core earnings, I think you need to have loss rates fall to more historic levels. I think you also need to see you know GDP growth, because what we see in billings is highly correlated to that. I mean its also affected by you know the products we put in the marketplace and putting value propositions out there. But I think to get back to a normal state I think we need to have GDP. Probably won\u2019t get back to where we were over the last 5 or 6 years but get back to a healthy growth level and to see write-off rates back to normal levels. Now if you look at historical periods being 1991 or 2001, you know credit really improved generally over 6 to 8 quarter period. Now whether that will replicate itself now or not, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. But one thing that is for sure is as credit improves, our provision levels will decrease. Now we could have a choice of just dropping that right to the bottom line or we could actually have a mix of allowing some of it to drop to the bottom line and using some of it to invest in the growth of our business. And that\u2019s what we plan to do. So I think that\u2019s what I think about overall. Now you also asked about pricing on our products. Now we did put some pricing increases in place earlier this year and we announced that put some in recently. Now you don\u2019t really see the impact of those recent increases in the third quarter. You will see those in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019re going to be very focused on as the credit indicators improve and as billed business improves to invest in the long term growth of the franchise.\nMeredith Whitney - Meredith Whitney Advisory LLC:  There\u2019s a large retailer that just described the current environment as \u201cspending has stabilized but there\u2019s no vitality.\u201d Is that what you\u2019re seeing? Or can you give us some anecdotes that might be interesting to characterize the kind of spending changes or stabilization that you\u2019re seeing?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I guess what we showed on the chart that kind of showed billings by month really June, July, August and September were all very consistent. Really stabilization of billings. Before that we were really in a declining environment. So I think that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen over the last four months is really a stabilization in billed business but not an acceleration at this point. And you know I think a lot of things are going to impact that. I think its GDP, it\u2019s what the savings rate is going to be and a lot depends on consumer confidence. So I think most things will need to move in the right direction before I think we start to see you know a notable improvement in the volume of billed business by month.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein.\nJohn McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein: I was wondering on the reserve release you expect the reserve release to continue in both the charge card and the lending books as we look to the fourth quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well we did not have a release of reserves in our lending book. We actually increased reserves by something north of $100 million. What actually takes place in the fourth quarter will be dependent on the actual you know write-offs and delinquencies that we see in the quarter, as well as what we see in the environment. Because when we think about what our provision should be and where our reserves should be, its looking at internal information as well as external information in terms of what risks continue to be in the environment. So in lending we actually had a reserve build in the quarter and next quarter will depend on you know the fact and circumstances at that time.\nJohn McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein:  If I\u2019m looking at Slide 19 correctly, with the yellow triangles and the blue triangles, the yellow triangles would suggest and kind of predict what your fourth quarter charge-offs would be and then the blue kind of suggests maybe the forward quarter and first quarter next year?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. The yellows will progress through the agings and be reflected as write-offs in the fourth quarter. Now what level they actually come in at will depend on you know what is the roll rate from 30 days past due to write-off? You know it could go up or down, based on where that rate goes. And you\u2019re right, the blue bars that you see there are more reflective of what you see in the first quarter. Now you can see that there\u2019s a little bit of a pickup in those blue bars and I would just point out that based on changes in the law, we had to change the payment date that we print out our statements. And in the past, if someone missed the payment date by a day or two, they still stayed current. Okay? However now if they\u2019re a sloppy payor and slip by that payment date, they actually roll one bucket. Okay? However, we\u2019ve looked at that bucket and the next bucket and if you actually go to the next bucket there\u2019s really no deterioration. The little pickup is really based on the change in the payment date that we had to put on our statements.\nJohn McDonald - Sanford C. Bernstein:  And just to clarify, so in the charge card book your reserving is dictated by the delinquencies and the level of A/R. Is that where you indicated you could release again and see some benefit that you would use on expenses?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think there\u2019s three factors that are going on that are affecting reserves. You know first it\u2019s just what the write-offs are and they\u2019re lower. Second very important is what\u2019s the change in delinquency from the prior quarter. Right? And in this quarter we had a decrease. Okay? So that was helping. In addition, the A/R balances are down. So all those things are contributing to it going down. Now what that number is next quarter will depend on where A/R goes. It will depend on the write-offs in the quarter and it will depend on whether delinquencies are stable, decline or increase. And all those factors will play in whether it\u2019s a release or a build.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray: Just looking to follow up on that Page 19, looking at those yellow bars I mean it looks like the average of those yellow bars is about 20% below the average of the green bars. I mean that would put your charge-offs hitting in the 7s in the fourth quarter. That would be a pretty significant improvement. I mean is that a reasonable way to think about that? I mean the trend in the bars is pretty much where you\u2019re pointing out to us it shows significant improvement in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\nDaniel T. Henry: So as you know I\u2019m not going to predict the, but the whole intent of this chart is to give you an indication of the information we have that can be helpful to you in thinking about that. But I remind you first that while it\u2019s 8.9% for the quarter, write-off rates were 8.4% in September. So you should keep that in mind. But also always keep in mind that chart just below it in terms of what percent rolls from 30 days past due to write-offs can be a factor. And if that drops it can be a real help in the write-off rate. If it ticked up, it would diminish the benefit that you\u2019d assume from those yellow bars. And the other thing is always think about this chart on the right which are bankruptcies. Right? So they were pretty stable from the second quarter to the third quarter, you know that could happen again in the fourth quarter or they could move up. So you know these are all different factors that are going to influence the fourth quarter. But your observation that the yellow triangles are lower than the green triangles are correct.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray:  A follow up on holiday spending I guess and your thoughts on holiday spending. And the chart on Chart 5, I think last year was the first time in my extended career that I\u2019ve ever seen spending lower in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. But do you have any research that American Express has done in working with retailers and your clients, do you have a feel for you know your thoughts on holiday spend? I mean would you be surprised if you don\u2019t, I mean I would expect that you would generally see and expect to see a pickup seasonally in those blue bars on Page 5.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I mean I think you\u2019re right. There\u2019s usually a seasonal increase. You know last year was as we all know an extraordinary year. You know as I said before you know we\u2019ve had stabilization for four months and it\u2019s really almost fact as I discussed before about whether that\u2019s going to pick up. I mean I think in the short term you know a lot of it has to do with consumer confidence and how people are feeling when they get into November and December.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray:  How\u2019s October look?\nDaniel T. Henry: So what I would say is that each month in the third quarter, our year-over-year decline billings improved and that\u2019s continuing into October so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc.\nCraig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc.: I have two questions for you. The first is regarding the managed loan book, historically you see an uptick in loans in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s seasonal. I understand that. But this year clearly we\u2019re in a materially different environment. Do you think that there will be appetite to increase leverage in the fourth quarter due to holiday spending or that we\u2019ll see another downtick in the overall lending balances?\nDaniel T. Henry: You know that\u2019s very hard for me to answer. It really depends on the psyche of consumer you know over the next two-and-a-half months. It\u2019s really hard to predict. You know whether the declining loan balance will be less than we had this quarter, it\u2019s hard to predict. But you know as I said I think I don\u2019t have a good insight into that but what we have seen is stabilization and you know where we go from here really depends on the psyche of the consumers over the next two-and-a-half months. So I don\u2019t have good insight for you.\nCraig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc.:  The other question is if you look at your reserve coverage, it\u2019s gone up substantially, especially if you look back to first quarter. I\u2019m trying to get an idea of what your comfort level is on reserve coverage because the directionality of the credit losses and delinquencies in the quarter would have dictated, at least in my mind, reserve stability rather than growing the reserve this quarter, but I understand the reason for a conservative approach. But looking out to the fourth quarter, I mean I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for what your comfort level is on coverage.\nDaniel T. Henry: So obviously some of that will depend on our internal metrics that we see. But also it\u2019ll depend on you know the external environment. If you know the external environment seems to be improving and be more positive, you know I think we\u2019ll factor that in. If on the other hand it continues to be very uncertain, very unclear about where unemployment\u2019s going to be, then we\u2019re going to factor that in. And if that\u2019s very uncertain I think we\u2019ll continue to be cautious. So I think it\u2019ll be both our internal metrics as well as what\u2019s taking place in the environment outside.\nCraig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc.:  And when you look at those coverage ratios, I\u2019m just curious which you weigh more heavily, coverage of total loans or coverage of delinquencies?\nDaniel T. Henry: We don\u2019t weigh any one as a premium to the other. We actually have you know a migration analysis that we do, based on historical information. You know we take a look at the re-agings that we did recently and estimate what we need for those. We look at really quite frankly half a dozen or more different ratios in terms of assessing you know where we should reserves. So I don\u2019t hold one as a premium to others. And in one period one may be more important to us than another. So I think it\u2019s really the whole myriad of internal information we have married with the external environment that really decides where we set reserve levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  You had guided to 15%, above 15% the last two quarters and below 15% for the year. With the performance this quarter you guys look like you\u2019ve done a little bit better than that.\nDaniel T. Henry:  Chris, I\u2019m sorry but I couldn\u2019t hear your question at all. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re on speakerphone or what but I really couldn\u2019t hear what you were asking.\nRon Stovall:  Can you pick up the handset maybe? All right, maybe he can call back. So operator, why don\u2019t we move to the next caller.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Dan, could you talk about the deep coupling trend between kind of billed business volume in U.S. card versus receivables shrinkage. Those seem to be tracking kind of closely in previous quarters and I was just wondering what exactly happened this quarter that led to a variance.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. Okay. So I think new cards coming in is one of the elements that causes loan balances and spending to run on similar tracks. So it\u2019s new customers coming in as well as spending on existing customers. So I think the fact that our marketing dollars have been down somewhat for some period of time here, a few quarters, is starting to have an impact. And just mathematically what we\u2019re seeing is that the cash that customers are sending in is exceeding the amount of billings and finance charges. So I can only surmise that some customers deciding that they want to de-leverage and we\u2019re seeing that in the loan balances. The other thing that I\u2019d point out is the payment rate is you know about 25% and has really held up really very well for us in this environment.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Another question, a follow up, was just not on guidance but some direction you gave us into the fourth quarter billed business volume trends to be kind of flat to maybe down low single digits. You know under that assumption, you\u2019re just looking at the trend in the third quarter, right? Are you including kind of the tailwinds you may have from FX and kind of gas prices?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I wasn\u2019t trying to do a forecast. All I was trying to do is say if we had $51 or $52 billion of billings in the three months in the fourth quarter, because the grow-over\u2019s getting easier we would actually be about flat, maybe down low single digits. I was just trying to dimensionalize you know where we\u2019re going if the stabilization continues. Certainly to the extent we get some pop from seasonality, you know that would be a plus. But I was just trying to frame it, I wasn\u2019t trying to make a prediction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup: Dan, there seems to be some concern in the marketplace about you know some of the bank competitors moving up into the higher end. And as you see the banks repositioning can you just provide us how your view on what the impact to American Express might be and your ability to compete?\nDaniel T. Henry: So you\u2019re talking about competition in the marketplace?\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup:  Yes. [Inaudible], J.P. Morgan and some of the other card players move upstream.\nDaniel T. Henry: So we have had the premium space for a very long time and the conversation of competitors wanting to move into our space was true 10 years ago as it is today. I mean it\u2019s a set of customers that everybody wants to have and so they work hard to achieve that. Now if we stand still you know they would move right past us and take our customers. But we are diligent in terms of thinking about how we can improve the value proposition in our products. You can see that in the way we\u2019ve built our membership rewards for instance, to continue to make it a premium program. You know we continue to be extremely diligent on servicing because servicing is a very, very important aspect. You may have seen that we were rated #1 in customer service by J. D. Power. And that\u2019s really a reflection of the fact that we\u2019ve always viewed servicing to be very important. So we know that the competition is coming after us. We\u2019re aware of that. And we will continue to be diligent. You know if you look at you know the actual data, for instance if you look at average spending of our cardmembers compared to the competition, you know it\u2019s significantly higher today. It was significantly higher five years ago and that really has not eroded over that time. So I think we\u2019ve been successful. We\u2019ll continue to be diligent and we understand that competition is fierce but we will continue to put new products in the marketplace that are right for the time. And as I said before it\u2019s our intent to take the improvement that we\u2019re seeing in provision and invest for the medium to long term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Furtado for Richard Shane - Jefferies & Co.\nDan Furtado for Richard Shane - Jefferies & Co.: We\u2019ve seen a substantial increase in the yield in the master trust over the last three months over the third quarter, yet there\u2019s been no material improvement in the managed U.S. [MIM] on the credit card portfolio and I was just wondering if this lack of follow through is just simply timing or if there\u2019s some type of fee deferment or other mechanism that is suppressing managed yield?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So it\u2019s really due to the discounting that we\u2019re doing in the trust as part of the enhancement we did earlier this year to support the trust. And it\u2019s also due to the fact that we\u2019re having lower credit losses. So I think the combination of those two things are what you\u2019re seeing in the improvement in yield in the trust.\nDan Furtado for Richard Shane - Jefferies & Co.:  And we shouldn\u2019t expect that to flow through to the managed parent?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, we always try to provide managed information because you know whether we\u2019re talking about yields or we\u2019re talking about write-off rates we always encourage you to look at the managed, because we think that\u2019s a reflection of the overall enterprise.\nDan Furtado for Richard Shane - Jefferies & Co.:  And then approximately how long ago in terms of your increase in the yield program to current existing cardholders, about how long ago did that start?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well we did some pricing changes back in the very beginning of 2009 and we put some other pricing increases in towards the latter part of the third quarter, which we\u2019ll see reflected in the numbers in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bradley Ball - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.\nBradley Ball - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Dan, it looks like you\u2019re seeing better credit improvement in the charge card business in the USCS relative to the lending business. If that\u2019s the case, why would that be the case? And you know in the past we used to look at the charge card business from a credit standpoint as a leading indicator of the lending business. Does that still hold up or have there been portfolio mix shifts that would cause that to disconnect?\nDaniel T. Henry: The charge card portfolio has really performed very well throughout the last year, despite what was taking place. And I think that\u2019s because we have the ability to approve every transaction at point of sale and it\u2019s a pay-in-full product so if someone\u2019s having difficulty from a payment ability perspective, we see it right away. And we have continued to hold our spills there. So I think that you know charge card was very good in this quarter but it really has been performing well over the last year. Some of the improvements in our modeling that we do in charge card we also use within our lending portfolios, and we think you know some of those initiatives are paying dividends to us not only in charge card but in lending as well. Now whether charge card will be you know a leading indicator of what\u2019s happening in lending, you know often we see something happen once or twice and we think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always going to be, but then we see something else change. You know we\u2019ve always thought business was a leading indicator of what was going to happen and that certainly didn\u2019t happen this time. So I don\u2019t know whether we can read it as a leading indicator for what\u2019s going to take place in lending. I would note that we did see in our portfolio some improvements in the lending which the competitors didn\u2019t see in the quarter.\nBradley Ball - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.:  What would you say that the complexion of the charge card customer you know resembles that of the lending customer still or is there any diversion there?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I think there are a fair number of customers who hold lending products that actually behave like charge card people. I mean particularly you see that in the co-brand portfolios, but you also see it from people who decide to have a Costco card because that\u2019s the reward that\u2019s the best for them. So you know I think you know you look at things like average spend within our lending products and they\u2019re higher than the competition does. And part of that I think is that we have you know a fair number of transactors in there.\nBradley Ball - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.:  I had been looking for slightly higher cardmember reward expense than you showed this quarter. You were sequentially down, below $1 billion in cardmember reward expense. I wonder if there\u2019s anything going on there, why that expense numbers down.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think it\u2019s one, volume. Volumes are down. And you should see rewards expense move with volumes. The other thing is we\u2019ve put a change in place this quarter in membership rewards to make it more restrictive in terms of someone\u2019s ability to [re-due] if they\u2019re 30 days past due. So I think a combination of those two factors is what drove rewards expense down I think 13%.\nBradley Ball - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.:  And I\u2019m sorry, is the volume issue coincident or does that reflect volumes from the prior periods?\nDaniel T. Henry: No, it\u2019s coincident. So you should see generally rewards expense moving with volumes in the period.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: My question is on lending. I apologize if it\u2019s been asked before. I\u2019m trying to multitask here. But my question is you know I think in my opinion your credit metrics looks to be one of the best in the industry recently. You\u2019ve definitely gotten control of that portfolio and in the lending business to start to behave much better these days. How do you feel about the lending business, you know maybe not necessarily this year but 2010, 2011? Have you made a [inaudible] decision on how much you want to compete in that business, you know what\u2019s the right size of that portfolio is going to be? Because it seems to me given the new rules its going to be a little more challenging to compete. And in the high end of the market, I think while your competitors would like to be where you are I\u2019m just wondering where the growth is going to come from maybe a little longer term. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Sure. So lending will continue to be a important business to us. Many of our customers who are very good customers and provide us with good economics want to have the availability to revolve periodically. Now I would say that we\u2019re going to have our focus in lending on a premium strategy and focus on co-brand cards, focus on premium proprietary cards, so I think you\u2019ll see us focus there to a greater degree. You know a few years back our lending spending was growing at a faster pace than the rest of the business. I would think that would be more similar as we go forward. But lending continues to be an important part of our business, but we want to do it in a way that\u2019s very consistent with our strategy of emphasizing spending.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  Is it too early to think about or to know when a rough idea of when the lending portfolio might bottom?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well I think that\u2019s going to be driven by a combination of the credit actions we take and the improvements and modeling that we have. But you know we\u2019re not an island here and it\u2019s going to be dependent on what happens in the economy. And if the economy stays stubbornly difficult, then I think improvement will take a longer period of time. But we\u2019re working hard to be very thoughtful about how we manage credit and I think you saw a reflection of that in this quarter\u2019s results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [Yanni Colaris] \u2013 Buckingham.\n[Yanni Colaris] \u2013 Buckingham:  What do you think the recovery of business potential or implementation of the Card Act?\nDaniel T. Henry: So you know the card act is going to obviously affect our revenues significantly. We think that it will impact our competitors more than it impacts us, but it certainly has a big impact. Now you know we\u2019ve taken some pricing actions as I said earlier this year and again recently. You know it\u2019s our intent to have a business model that has good economics for our shareholders and balance that with the need to meet the needs of our customers. But you know it has a short term impact but we are very focused on having the right economics and margins in our business over the long term. Now you know that the implementation as of I think February, I think the committee that Chairman Frank heads actually passed out of committee a recommendation or approval to bring to the floor, a recommendation to move that up into December. So we\u2019ll have to see whether that happens or not and what impact that would have. But certainly it will have a significant impact on our ability to be ready and have all the system changes in that we need to comply with the new rules.\n[Yanni Colaris] \u2013 Buckingham: How many GE commercial cards were converted? And what was the related billed business volume? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: So we have not disclosed that number, but what I will say is that the actual performance of the cards that we set out to achieve was very much in line with our expectations and we\u2019re achieving the economics that we expected when we did that transaction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  Dan I think you mentioned earlier maybe on the re-aging policy change. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on that and also maybe I don\u2019t think you disclosed in the past, but any color on modification levels maybe, since you\u2019re increasing modifications, and again on recidivism that you might be seeing.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So we moved to a re-aging policy which is comparable to the standard in the industry and in fact probably our policies in terms of how often will we age are stricter than many others in the industry. And it\u2019s part of our effort to get the right economics. And so to the extent we modified our policies and believe that we\u2019ll be able to keep certain customers in the franchise, you know that\u2019ll have a positive economic. Or even if we don\u2019t keep them in the franchise forever, it would enable us to have greater collections than if we would have otherwise had if we stayed with our older policies. So that was the economics of it, was the driving force. Those things did have some impact on our ratios but it\u2019s the other actions that we\u2019ve taken also have a very sizable impact on the improvement in our ratios as well.  You know we certainly are working with customers and to the extent we can make modifications as part of our CARE program to do something that\u2019s helpful to both the customer and has good economics for the company, you know we will certainly do that.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.:  And just a follow up on marketing, are you seeing better acceptance rates with your offers given there\u2019s a little less competition?\nDaniel T. Henry: I don\u2019t know that number specifically, Scott, to tell you the truth, but certainly all of the investments that we make have good returns for us. And really at the end of the day that\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re most focused on is that if we\u2019re making an investment that over the life of the customer that we acquire that we get good returns from a shareholder perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  Just a quick question. It seems like just in bifurcating the credit card trust and the charge card trust we see a dynamic underneath in terms of spending and it seems like the charge card portfolio seems to be showing a little bit more snapback, at least in terms of spending versus the credit card trust. I\u2019m wondering underneath the surface of your global spending per account numbers that you\u2019ve provided to us, are you seeing a difference in the customer behavior between your charge card consumer and the credit card consumers and the behavior that they may exhibit?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so if you go back to one of my slides we actually show you by month charge card spending and lending spending. It\u2019s Chart number 7 and I think what you can see on there the fact that charge card is snapping back faster than lending. You know lending looks like it flattened out and charge card is improving. So I think that\u2019s an indication of that.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  And can you talk to me about the dynamics underneath that would be the catalyst to that? Because that\u2019s really just a change in growth rate not an absolute return in spending.\nDaniel T. Henry: So you know I think it\u2019s based on probably the behaviors of the customers as well as the credit actions we\u2019re taking, you know. And I think we continue to be very focused on the lending portfolio and lending spending to be focused on allowing who to spend through. I mean one of the things that we\u2019ve been able to do that\u2019s helped our statistics is really reduce the amount of high balance write-off. And that\u2019s really us being able to intercede more quickly when someone\u2019s credit is deteriorating. And when you really think about it, charge, because it\u2019s a pay-in-full product is really a product that\u2019s right for these times when people are looking to be more prudent in terms of managing their finances.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  And with that, when would be able to see marketing dollars turn into accounts? Would it be in the charge card business a little more rapidly than what we would see in the credit card business? And it\u2019s obviously emphasized in the past the strength of the charge card product over credit. Will we see the effect of marketing dollars growing in the charge card business? And will those charge card customers still be reflective of what we can see as those positive dynamics in the charge card portfolio today?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so we in acquisition we\u2019re focused on charge card, we\u2019re focused on our program products, you know as we\u2019ve mentioned we extended our deal with British Airways, we recently re-signed with Delta and extended our contract with Starwood. So I think charge and co-brand is the place where you\u2019ll see you know the benefits of our spending on marketing.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  And my last question, are you seeing any geographic differences in terms of spending?\nDaniel T. Henry: So outside the United States spending on an FX adjusted basis was 6%, which is better than what we see in the States. When you look in the regions outside the U.S., I think generally Latin America\u2019s doing a little bit better but the other regions are pretty consistent.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  And inside the U.S.? A little more granularity?\nDaniel T. Henry: You know I think it\u2019s pretty broad-based what we\u2019re seeing by product and by geography.\nJohn Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey:  Great. Thank you for your time.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So and this will be the last question, operator.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Please continue.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. All right. Thank you everyone for joining the call. We appreciate it. You know as we sat here in the first half of this year, billed business was dropping, credit write-offs were increasing and liquidity was on the top of everybody\u2019s mind. You know as we sit here today, billed business has stabilized over the last few quarters, credit write-offs while still at historic levels are improving, and while it\u2019s not clear exactly how the funding markets will evolve, the markets certainly have far more liquidity today. So we have navigated through these difficult markets, demonstrating the flexibility of our business model, and now we will focus on how we invest for the future over the medium to long term.  So thanks everybody for joining the call.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 7:00 PM tonight through midnight, October 29.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session giving instructions at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ron Stovall.\nRon Stovall:  As usual, it\u2019s my job to remind you that the discussions today contain certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8K report and in the company\u2019s 2008 10K report already on file with the Securities & Exchange Commission, in the second quarter 2009 earnings release and our earnings supplement on file with the SEC in an 8K report as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at IR.AmericanExpress.com. We have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included within the earnings documents and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry : I will start with the slides, Slide Two, summary of financial performance; we can see that total revenues decreased by 18%. If you looked at that on a managed and an fx adjusted basis it would be 10%. We had earnings from continuing operations of $342 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.09. Now, if you back out the $0.18 related to the repayment of the CPP preferred we would be at $0.27. When we issued the preferred we also issued a warrant that we valued at $230 million. The preferred stock was carried on our books at $3.4 billion issuance less that $230 million and that difference would be amortized over the five years that the preferred could have been outstanding. So, when we repaid the preferred we repaid $3.4 billion and the difference between the par and book value was $218 million. Now, this is not a reduction in net income but it is a reduction in EPS of $0.18 and excluding it our EPS was $0.27. Now, comparing our EPS to consensus is very difficult. Some analysts included the $0.18, others did not, some handled the ICBC gain and our restructuring charge differently and as a result of that the range of consensus was anywhere from zero up to $0.44. [First Call], in an effort to have consistency only included six of the 19 firms that provide estimates so in the end it\u2019s all pretty confusing when you try to compare our results to consensus. I think the important thing is we had $0.27 of EPS and earned above our stated goal which is to earn in excess of our dividend. Let me turn to Slide Three, significant items; in the quarter we had a gain on the sale of 50% of our holdings in ICBC. That took place in April, the pre-tax gain was $211 million, after tax that was $135 million. Next, related to our reengineering we set up a reserve for the reengineering that we announced in May that primarily relates to the reduction in staff levels. Pre-tax that\u2019s $182 million and after tax $118 million. The combination of the reengineering that we announced in the fourth quarter of \u201908 and the second quarter of \u201909 is expected to eliminate approximately 11,000 positions or 17% of our global jobs.  Moving to Slide Four, this lays out in tabular form what I discussed a few minutes ago. Based on net income, EPS would have been $0.29. Deducting the preferred dividend and the related accretion we take it to $0.27 and then you see deducting the $212 or $0.18 you get down to the $0.09. So, this is a tabular form of what I described a few minutes ago.  Turning to metric performance of Slide Five, you can see that the billed business on a reported basis was 16% or 13% on an fx adjusted basis. This compares to the first quarter of 16% reported or the same number or 12% on an fx basis so a little more deterioration on an fx basis. As we\u2019ve said, the first five months of 2009 billed business was relatively flat. In June and month-to-date July, the year-over-year spending decline has moderated slightly compared to May. Transactions have continued to hold up well and were only down about 3% so that\u2019s a good thing that customers continue to pull their cards out of their wallet so it\u2019s really a story of lower spending per transaction. Now, if you look at cards in force, they are down 2% and impacting that is the fact that we cancelled 2.7 million inactive cards and we did that for credit reasons to reduce our exposure. Those were cards that were both balance and spend inactive for 24 months. Now, you may note that our average spending decline is 15% compared to 18% in the first quarter and that is largely driven by the cancellation of the inactive cards as opposed to a change in spending.  The percentage change in owned loans you can note is literally higher than the managed and that\u2019s because the securitized loans are about or slightly higher than where they were last year and that\u2019s what\u2019s really causing the difference when you look at managed compared to owned. As you can see worldwide sales continues to be significantly impacted by the economy.  Now, moving to Slide Six, revenue performance you can see that discount revenues is down 17% and that\u2019s a combination of billed business being down 16% and discount rate being at 2.55% or only down one basis point from last year. So, that has held up very well. If you look at net card fees, it is only down 2% which is another reflection that our fees have held up well. I think these two things reflect the value that merchants and cardholders see in our network and our card products.  If you look at net interest and securitization income it\u2019s down 37%. Securitization income is down $229 million basically driven by higher credit losses and net interest income is lower primarily driven by lower loan balances. Travel commissions and fees are being impacted by the economy. If you looked at all other revenues it\u2019s down 5% but it includes the gain from ICBC and if you exclude that it would be down about 23% in line with the decline in business volumes.  Moving to Slide Seven, provision for losses you can see that the charge card provision continues to be comparable to last year and later we\u2019ll see that while there is somewhat higher write offs, delinquencies are slightly lower compared to last quarter and receivables balances are down about 21%. On the other hand, the lending provision is having a significant impact on our results. I\u2019d remind you that last year in the second quarter of \u201908 the provision included a $600 million addition so despite average owned loans decreasing 29% in \u201909 compared to \u201908, provision remains high driven by the metrics that we\u2019ll discuss on the next few slides and the fact that we continue to build reserves and coverage ratios given the uncertainty in the economic environment. Looking at expenses on page eight, you can see that marketing and promotion is down 47% and that\u2019s part of our reengineering plan although it is having an impact on cards in force growth. Now, looking at rewards expense, rewards expense is down 8% and that\u2019s a combination of lower spending volumes of 16% partially offset by slightly higher MR redemption rates which tend to fluctuation a little bit from period-to-period and relatively lower declines in co-brand spending and co-brand spending generally has a slightly higher cost per point.  If you look at salaries and benefits, it\u2019s down 8% but if you exclude the reengineering charge, it\u2019s down 19%. Looking at other operating expense, it\u2019s down 16% but 2009 includes $150 million of MasterCard settlement payments which were not in \u201908 and if you exclude that it\u2019s down about 6%. Overall, we are controlling operating expenses very well.  While looking at the metrics for the segments starting with USCS on Slide Nine, you can see that the billed business is down 16%, that compares with 15% in the first quarter. If you look at cards in force you can see that it\u2019s down 9% and that\u2019s being impacted by the cancellation of inactive cards. Excluding that, it would have been down around 3%. If you looked at the mix between charge and lending they are both down around the same percentage. What\u2019s happening is the lower average card member spending is really what\u2019s driving the lower billed business. If you look at loans, fortunately managed loans are decreasing at a similar rate in the drop in billed business.  Moving to international consumer services, you can see the billed business is down 20% of 7% on an fx adjusted basis. In the first quarter reported was down 21% and fx was down about 5%. We see a decline across all geographies although Latin America while down is slightly better than the other regions on an fx adjusted basis.  Looking at cards in force were down about 5% and over recent quarters we have cancelled about 400,000 cards. If you excluded that we would be down about 2%. Again here, loans are tracking with billed business which is good. Looking at travel sales, you can see that it\u2019s being substantially impacted by the economy.  Moving to global commercial services, you can see that billed business is down 23% on a reported basis and 18% on an fx basis, the same as the first quarter. So, what we are seeing is a significant pull back on T&E by many companies and we\u2019re seeing that globally. If you look at the US, we\u2019re down about 17%. Outside the US we\u2019re down about 33% but 21% on an fx adjusted basis. Again here, it\u2019s across all geographies but again, Latin America on an fx basis is down slightly less than the others but this very broad base. The increase in cards in force is being driven by the cards that are moving to the AMEX network as part of our CPS or GE acquisition that we did last year and again here, you can see the economy is having a significant impact on travel sales.  Next, moving to global network and merchant services, Slide 12, you can see here billings were down 16% in the quarter, same as the first quarter. Now, in the US we continued to be impacted more in the United States than we are outside of the United States on an fx adjusted basis which is consistent with last quarter. Now, you if you look at US everyday spending, that declined about 12% which represents 71% of our US billings and US T&E spending has declined about 20%. Again here you see that the average discount rate is at 2.5% down only one basis point that is very good. Now, global network services billed business continues to perform well on a relative basis and in fact is up 6% on an fx adjusted basis. This is being driven by the 13% growth in cards in force and this is largely being driven by new cards coming from new products being launched with existing customers.  Moving to credit metrics on Slide 13 we\u2019ll look at the charge card net write off and 30 day past due related to the US consumer business. Now, as I mentioned before, the charge card provision has performed relatively well. While the write off rate is up, write off dollars in the second quarter of \u201909 are very similar to the write off dollars we had in the first quarter of \u201909 and the second quarter of \u201908. Here we\u2019re being impacted quite a bit by the fact that accounts receivable is 20% lower than last year. If you look at past dues, it has improved somewhat and the dollar amount of past dues are down compared to both the first quarter and the second quarter of last year.  Moving to Slide 14, charge card net loss ratio and the 90 day past due relating to international consumer and global commercial card, you can see that the write off rates are either comparable or up slightly compared to the first quarter of \u201909 and the 90 day past due rates have improved slightly as the past due dollars are similar to the first quarter of \u201909 and the second quarter of \u201908. Now, the charge card provision for commercial card and international consumer are not the main driving force in the lower earnings that we have in those segments. Let me turn to Slide 15, lending managed debt write off rate, now this is having a significant impact driving lower earnings. Now here, we are being impacted by both higher write off dollars and lower average loans. Now, the US managed write off rate we had forecasted for the second quarter to be between 10.5% and 11% and the actual is coming in at 10%. Now, the write off rate is made up of contractual write offs which are balances that really roll through the various aging buckets current to 30 and ultimately to 210 days when they are written off, early write offs which are bankruptcies and recoveries.  Now, within our forecast our estimate for contractual and recoveries were pretty good. However, early write offs while higher than the first quarter came in better than we had forecasted. So, the fact that the actual are better than forecasted are a positive but I would still want to remind people that write off rates are at historically high levels. Now, when we look to forecasts for the third and fourth quarter of this year for US managed write off rates we think they will be below 10% and I\u2019ll discuss that more in a minute. Now, if we look at international we can see that we have an increase in write off rates and we are having lower balances and therefore that\u2019s causing the write off rate to be up but not to the same degree that we\u2019re seeing in the US. Slide 16 is really attempting to dimension the denominator impact which is the fact that balances are falling over this period. So, here we\u2019re showing you both the reported write off rate as well as a lag calculation. The lag calculation is the write offs in the current period compared to loan balances two quarters prior basically when those dollars were generated. So here you can see that they\u2019re still rising but not nearly as sharply as they are on a reported basis. Moving to Slide 17 lending managed 30 day past dues and you can see that we are having positive results in the second quarter both in the US and international compared to the first quarter. Now, this is benefitting from the risk actions that we have taken both from underwriting in terms of the new accounts that we\u2019re approving, customer management which includes things like line reductions and enhanced collection practices as we try to work with card members who are having temporary difficulties.  Now, I would note that we did change our policy related to forgiveness of interest and fees and are moving more towards industry practice and that fact is contributing to the lower 30 day past due rates that we have. Although, without that change the 30 day past due rates are still improving. I\u2019ll talk about delinquencies more on the next slide.  Slide 18, so this is an important slide so let me take a few minutes here. Write offs are a combination of the accounts that roll from current to 30 days past due and that\u2019s the top chart and it also is impacted by the amount that eventually roll from 30 days past due to write off and that\u2019s the bottom chart. Now, if we look at the bottom chart and we look at the red triangles this is the period over which the rate started to climb and that occurred through March of \u201908 through August of \u201908 and then it stabilized which is dimensioned by the yellow triangles but I would note that it stabilized at a high rate and that high rate is causing higher write offs. Now, if we move to the top chart, this is being compounded by the fact that the number of accounts moving from current to 30 days past due started to increase in June of \u201908. Now, if you look at the red triangles which are from August of \u201908 to January of \u201909 these are the accounts that wrote off in the first and second quarter. The yellow triangles are what we will see write off in the third and fourth quarter. So, our forecast for the third and fourth quarter is really based on the fact that the yellow triangles are improving and we\u2019re assuming that the amount of 30 day past due to write off which is the bottom chart will stay at consistent levels. Now, what we\u2019re forecasting obviously will be impacted by whether the bottom chart actually worsens in which case they\u2019d be higher than we\u2019re currently estimating or they get better and would be actually lower. Now, in addition to that, not on that chart is that we have an estimate for bankruptcies which we\u2019re forecasting to increase and recoveries which we\u2019re forecasting to be constant. Now, the first yellow triangle on the top chart which is February of \u201909 will influence the write offs that we see in July and since that is lower than the prior triangle which is what generated write off in June, if all other things stay constant as I described we would see lower write offs in the month of July. You can see that those yellow triangles are improving modestly thereafter. That was somewhat complicated but I hope it was helpful in terms of you understanding what has driven the write offs that we saw in the first and second quarter and the basis for our forecast for the third and fourth quarter.  To summarize, if we move to Slide 19, the second quarter \u201909 write off rate of 10% was 50 to 100 basis points better than the previous estimates driven largely by better than expected bankruptcy trends. Assuming delinquencies continue around their current level and bankruptcies increase somewhat, third quarter \u201909 and fourth quarter \u201909 net write off rates will likely be better than previously estimated and fall below 10%. A significant portion of the provision benefits versus our prior estimates will likely be used to selectively increase spending on marketing and promotions and other business initiatives so this is very important.  Our focus has always been and is now on the medium to long term. We have reduced investments in the short term which have impacted cards in force, our investment in sales force and the network. We will take a significant portion of the provision benefit and selectively increase marketing and promotions and other business initiatives. Let\u2019s move now to Slide 20 which is our worldwide lending provision. Now, then yellow bar is the amount that we write off each quarter, the blue bar is our provision. Now, we said provision we\u2019ve taken in to account our models, key metrics and the economic outlook. We\u2019ve increased reserves in the second quarter based on our perceived inherent risk in our portfolio.  Now, let me go to the next slide that shows coverage ratios. Now, this slide shows reserves as a percentage of owned loans and as you can see this coverage has increased significantly. Now, another metric that is not on this slide but that some analyst look at is months coverage of principle write offs. Now, historically we did not provide information that enabled people to do this calculation. Now, in the tables in the press release we split out write offs for principle and write offs for interest and fees as well as splitting the reserve between the reserve for principle and the reserves for interest and fees and this is page 14 in the tables. If you look at that, you would see that the principle coverage ratio on a worldwide basis is 10.7%.  Let me now move to another look at billed business. This chart we showed last quarter. The blue line relates to credit card billings which is the solid line and lending managed loans which is the dotted line and you can see that loans continue to move in line with billings. The yellow line is charge cards, the solid line is billings and the dotted line is card member receivables and again, they are moving together. Now, spending is not the only factor, payment rate is also very important but that has held up well for us during this period. So net/net this is a positive story for us. Moving to Slide 23 and capital ratios, if you looked at the second quarter of \u201909 these ratios are all well above either well capitalized or the benchmark rates. Now, the increase in these ratios that you see from the fourth quarter of \u201908 through the first quarter of \u201909 is largely driven by the CPP preferreds that we issued. Now, we have provided a pro forma first quarter reflecting the issuance of $500 million of common equity, the credit enhancement actions that we took related to our trust in the second quarter and the repayment of the CPP preferred.  As you can see the second quarter ratios are very similar to the first quarter. Now, I think it\u2019s also important if you\u2019re comparing the second quarter ratios to the fourth quarter as a result of the enhancement actions we took in the second quarter, for regulatory purposes we brought those securitized receivables back in to the risk weighted asset calculation. So, in there as we look at the second quarter those assets are all within the calculations when they weren\u2019t in the fourth quarter of \u201908. These are very strong ratios that we continue to have in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 24, this is our excess cash and readily marketable securities, most of you are familiar with the activity here. We start with the ending balance in March. As you know, we paid the CPP preferred. As I\u2019ll talk about more in a minute, we\u2019ve increased our retail deposits, we\u2019ve also issued $3 billion in unguaranteed debt as well as $500 million in common equity. We have met the maturities of long term debt in the quarter and we shifted $2 billion from cash over to the liquidity investment portfolio.  That brings us to $16 million in cash. We always back out the operating cash that we need to run the business as well as short term oustandings and then we add in our liquidity investment portfolio and stand at $22 billion. When you compare that to maturities over the next 12 months which is on Slide 25, you can see that we have cash and marketable securities in excess of our maturities for the next 12 months.  Next, moving to Slide 26 this is just a little bit more information on our brokered retail deposits. You can see that we raised $4 billion in the quarter. The average duration on those were 22 months and the average rate was 1.7%. Our sweep accounts are relatively stable and we did a soft launch of our direct deposit program in June as well.  The next page is page 27 and I would point out that we view deposits as our primary source of funding for the balance of the year although we\u2019re likely to tap the debt markets as well. You can see here our additional sources and contingent sources although we currently don\u2019t plan to utilize those over the balance of 2009.  With that, let me conclude with a few final comments. While operating results were down significantly compared to last year due to the difficult economy, we remain focused on our three key priorities: to stay liquid; to stay profitable; and to selectively invest for the long term. We believe we are making good progress against each of these goals. Obtaining them should position us to emerge from this down turn in a strong competitive position.  From the liquidity perspective we had $22 billion of excess cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter. This balance met our goals of holding cash in readably marketing securities at least equal to the next 12 months of maturities on a rolling basis. In the quarter, as I said, we successfully continued to build our US retail deposit base. We raised $4 billion of retail deposits in the quarter, bringing our total to approximately $19 billion including a small contribution from the initial soft launch of our direct deposit program in June.  During the quarter we demonstrated our ability to access various unsecured and secured funding sources. However, for the remainder of 2009 we continue to view deposits as our primary funding source although we will likely also tap the debt markets again. The designation by the Federal Reserve board that American Express had no capital needs under the supervisory capital assessment program, the subsequent repayment of the $3.4 billion of CPP preferred shares provided by the Treasury and the related $500 million common equity offering are all evidence of the strength of our capital position.  Turning to our second goal, we remain profitable in the quarter generating $342 million of earnings from continuing operations. These reflect the competitive strength of our diverse business model, given the multiple roles we play as a payment issuer, processor and network provider. Additionally, they underscore the flexibility of our model and the ability to adapt to a very difficult economic environment that is still characterized by weak spending levels and rising unemployment.  As we indicated during the quarter, card member spending remained under pressure within all our business activities. While the year-over-year spending decline was fairly consistent through the first five months of the year, the decline has moderated slightly in June and July year-to-date and will likely moderate further later in the year as comparisons for last year continued to get easier. Overall, in light of our proportionately greater level of corporate and consumer discretionary spending, we continue to feel good about the relative level of our spending volumes compared to the other major card competitors.  Our operating expense trends in the quarter also reflect the savings we have been able to achieve through the two previously announced reengineering programs. Based on our progress to date we are on track to realize substantial additional operating expense benefits this year. In the quarter we increased the reserve balance as lending write off rates rose sharply and the outlooks in the economy and for unemployment remains uncertain. However, the increase in write offs was less than we anticipated mostly due to the lower than expected bankruptcy levels.  In addition, lending past due trends continued to improve. Assuming delinquencies continue around current levels and bankruptcies increase somewhat, we believe that it is highly likely that we will perform better than we previous forecasted. In fact, we now expect US managed lending net write off rate during the next two quarters to be below 10%. We continue to be focused on generating earnings in excess of our dividend. While some of the recent trends give us confidence in our ability to meet this goal, the benefits relating to lower than expected credit provision costs will most likely be directed towards investments and other business initiatives.  The net result of all these factors position us to selectively increase marketing and promotions and other investments to a level higher than we planned. This would reduce the $1.5 billion of investment related savings included in the $2.6 billion of total reengineering benefits targeted through our two previously announced programs. Our investments in the third and fourth quarter will focus on a number of key business goals including our premium lending strategy evidenced by the investments in our partnership expansion with Delta and the recent extension of our Starwood partnership, activities surrounding our proactive charge card product and marketing efforts, various merchant acceptance, corporate services and G&S expansion initiatives and activities surrounding our data and information management capabilities.  Our ability to balance these investments against our financial goals will require continued flexibility. As we move forward, we believe our historic success in achieving this balance positions us well to further build upon our competitor strengths. We recognize that this will continue to be a very difficult and uncertain operating environment. In addition to dealing with the uncertain economy, we also need to adopt the new regulatory climate in the US and some overseas markets.  Given that approximately 80% of our revenues come from fees rather than interest charges we expect to be affected less than competitors who rely on promotional rates, balance transfers, penalty fees and back end charges. However, the impact of new regulations will be more negative than positive and unfortunately provide new limits to the industry\u2019s ability to appropriately price for higher levels of risk and may have the unintended consequence of restricting credit availability to some borrowers.  Now in closing, our business model comprises a diverse set of activities that span the payment industry. Our brand is an important asset that is recognized and respected around the globe. Our premium card member base remains a key advantage as it retains the capacity to grow spending substantially when the economy improves. Our global merchant network is positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities within the payment industry. We\u2019re focused on our balance sheet in order to have the capital, funding and liquidity profile that is appropriate for these volatile times. And of course, across all of our businesses we\u2019ve instilled a strong focus on the customer, someone we need to stay close to regardless of the environment. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: I wanted to ask you if you could give us a little more detail on what you\u2019re seeing on the credit side? The amount of improvement you saw this quarter sounds like it was a little better than you thought certainly, better than I thought just given what we\u2019re seeing in the macro environment. Do you give any credence to the theory that we\u2019re seeing some of the overleveraged consumers sort of burn off and we\u2019re left with a deteriorating trend not nearly as bad as we saw in the second half just because you\u2019ve seen some of the worst of that impact last year? Any color you can give on just what you\u2019re seeing on the credit side.\nDaniel T. Henry : I guess what I\u2019d point out is that the better than expected performance that we saw in the quarter was really driven by bankruptcies coming in better than we thought. Now, bankruptcies were higher than the first quarter but not to the magnitude that we expected. We\u2019re actually continuing to forecast that bankruptcies will increase in the third and fourth quarter. By contrast, our forecast for the third and fourth quarter is really predicated on the fact that we have seen an improvement in the low rate from current to 30 days past due. Now, you might remember that back on the first quarter call we saw delinquencies were a little better in February and March but at that juncture we weren\u2019t certain whether that was just a seasonal trend or whether it was going to continue but we\u2019ve seen in continuing to improve as you can see on that one slide that is included in the package. The real question is kind of where do we go from here but at least we have about five months where we\u2019ve seen a trend down and that really improvement in the roll rate from current to 30 days past due is the basis for our improved forecast as we go over the balance of the year.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus: A follow up question, any improvement that you think you might see in the second half of the year on the spending side? I think there\u2019s obviously going to be some easier comparisons as we get to the fourth quarter but, anything that you saw in the quarter that suggested that we might see spending pick up a little bit if you sort of x out any of those easier comps or just core spending trends, is there any signs of improvement yet?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think the first five months of the year were pretty consistent but in June and month-to-date July the year-over-year decline has moderated slightly. So, the question is will that continue. Certainly, as we look at year-over-year growth as we go over the balance of the year they\u2019re going to have easier grow overs because it was right around this time last year that we started to see the impact on spending. I guess I would not that the slight moderation that we saw was really driven in the US so we\u2019ll have to see what we see from here.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: I wonder could you give a little more color on what you saw in the changes in spending in June and July? Was there more travel, more discretion spending? More transactions, fewer transactions, bigger transactions?\nDaniel T. Henry : I guess I would leave it David that we in June and July month-to-date saw a slight moderation. I tried to provide a little color in that is really coming from the US as opposed to international but at this juncture we haven\u2019t broken it down to a final level in terms of where that is coming from. I\u2019d want to emphasize that it\u2019s a slight moderation so you\u2019ll probably see different categories moving quite a bit as they always do within the aggregate number. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Can you just clarify what you\u2019re guiding to in the way of the improvement in charge off rate? What are you assuming in the way of balance declines, how much is the denominator factoring in and then can you be more specific about what happened in bankruptcies? Bankruptcies overall are up 35% to 40% pretty consistently across the year for the nation so your experience is obviously different. I wonder if you can help relate that?\nDaniel T. Henry : What I would say is bankruptcies are up and we think they\u2019ll continue to trend up. I actually think across the industry, in June in particular, I think the industry saw that the filings were probably less than had been anticipated so I don\u2019t know that it was completely unique to us in June. Now, the first part of your question around write off rates was?\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Well, you\u2019re guiding to lower write off rates than you had previously but there\u2019s some issue with the denominator and I was just wondering if you could help us understand. So, if we thought about dollar charge offs do you see dollar charge offs flat? Down?\nDaniel T. Henry : I would think that it is really more the change in our forecast from the first quarter to the second quarter is really being guided by the change that we saw in the dollar amount that was rolling from current to 30 days past due. That\u2019s really the driving force in the change in the write off rate. We have really not changed notably in the last three months our forecast for where loan balances will be. So, it\u2019s really the improvement in the roll rate from current to 30 days past due that\u2019s impacting the guidance that we\u2019re now giving.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Are you assuming the same kind of rate of decline in balances that you had in the second quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry : Well, I think we already see all of the buckets that are going to impact the balance of the year have already been baked if you look at those yellow triangles in the top of that chart. The question is whether the roll rates for the accounts that are 30 days past due to write off, whether they improve or deteriorate. For purposes of our forecast we\u2019ve assumed that they stay at a consistent level that we\u2019ve seen over the last several months.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bill Carcache \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton: I have a question on the reserve build, one of your competitors announced that it elected to release reserves and said the release was due to lower loan balances. Your loan balances are also down 34% and you\u2019re now reserved at 240% of accounts past due but you mentioned that you expect future losses to help you fund greater investment. I\u2019m just trying to understand the thought process behind booking a big reserve build now when it sounds like you expect to release reserves in the second half of \u201909. So net/net that build now impacts your results but it sounds like you\u2019re going to release it later but then there\u2019s going to be some investment in marketing. I guess is this just a conservative outlook so you\u2019re well positioned in case delinquencies start to rise again or can you just kind of help me kind of thing through that?\nDaniel T. Henry : Looking at the second quarter certainly loan balances are down 18% on a managed basis and a higher number on an owned bases however, let\u2019s remember that our write off rate while better than we had forecasted was at 10% which is almost double the rate we had a year ago. So, we are seeing a significant increase in the quarter in write off rates. While delinquencies have improved, if you look at the rate that rolls from 30 days past due to write offs, they are at very high levels. So, those are the things that we were looking at.  We also look at coverage ratios and we look at the outlook for the economy and quite frankly, we think the economy is very uncertain in terms of where it is going to go from here. If you look at the most recent Blue Chip forecasts for unemployment, it has unemployment continuing to rise, I think it peaks in the first quarter of next year at 10.1% but still staying stubbornly high. So, when we factor all those things together we think the inherent risk in the portfolio warranted us to build reserves, I think we built them by about $200 million.  Now, to answer the second question, in terms of the balance of the year and the fact that we\u2019ll have provision benefit, that is based on the fact that we will have lower write off rates which will therefore have lower provision. It\u2019s not making any statement about a reserve release. It\u2019s largely being driven by the fact that we anticipate lower write offs in the third and fourth quarter. \nBill Carcache \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton: Then last question is you talked about changes in practices that had an impact on delinquency rates that you\u2019re now more in line with the [inaudible] convention. Can you talk about those?\nDaniel T. Henry : Yes, it\u2019s just our policy in terms of forgiving interest and fees is now more in line with the industry. By doing that it really provides a lower amount that the customer needs to pay that enables them to do that and work through this difficult time and that has an impact in terms of the level of delinquencies we have. But, it is very much in line with industry practice. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citi.\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citi: A quick question Dan, I was wondering if you can comment on your expectations for interchange regulation? It sounds like it\u2019s probably on hold until the [GAO] study. I wanted to see if you could just comment on your expectation and any impact to the business as you look out?\nDaniel T. Henry : As you know, at one juncture there was an interchange like provision in the credit card bill, I think there was a fair amount of concern and opposition to that and it was taken off the bill. There have been a number of other proposals discussed. As we have said in the past, it\u2019s not clear to us why Congress would charge to basically be fixing pricing in this industry and wouldn\u2019t let the market place drive pricing. Having said that, what actions Washington will take we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We will obviously be talking to people on the Hill and expressing our perspective in terms of what we think is the appropriate action to be taken for the economy. \\\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citi: What is sort of your expectation? I mean, do you think there\u2019s real risk to interchange or is it the type of situation where you don\u2019t know at this point?\nDaniel T. Henry : Clearly the fact that that original provision was taken off the bill I think indicates that there\u2019s a fair number of people that have concern and opposition to it and we wouldn\u2019t think it would be a logical action to be taken. That said, we don\u2019t control what actions could potentially be taken in Washington. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: I have a few questions, one is related to the 2000 cards that you deactivated. What were the balances or the credit lines associated with those?\nDaniel T. Henry : It was 2.7 million cards, the criteria that we used was that the card was both balance and spend in active. So, these are cards that had no spending for 24 months and had no balances.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: But what were their open available balances at the time you cut them?\nDaniel T. Henry : You will see that our credit lines have come down quite a bit over the quarter, total available lines have come down quite a bit over the quarter. The cancellation of these cards are a sizeable piece of that decline without giving you an exact number.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: I don\u2019t think you release those quarterly that\u2019s why I was trying to get you to do that because I think you just put those ones out on an annual basis?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think that if you look at Treasury information you would be able to see on a monthly basis the movement in the available lines that are out there.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: Then, just to follow up on that question and then I\u2019m going to move on to another one real quick, of the cards that you deactivated was there a meaningful response to your customers so that they said we actually want the card? Was there any push back on that?\nDaniel T. Henry : To the extent we had calls from customers then we could effectively reunderwrite them and if we considered them to be credit worthy then we would issue them new cards.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: Was that a meaningful number or not a meaningful number?\nDaniel T. Henry : It\u2019s not information that we\u2019ve disclosed.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: Then with respect to the pricing of the core card business, the fact that you no longer have the securitization fees would argue that you would need to reprice your card business in a fairly meaningful way. Can you talk about your efforts? And also, particularly because of the credit card legislation that has changed, can you talk about your repricing efforts, where you are, where you\u2019re going to be and obviously that\u2019s based towards potentially margin expansion?\nDaniel T. Henry : As I talked about I think in the last call, we did some repricing of customers back in the January/February time frame and so those are reflected in our numbers. Because of the Credit Card Act, which will affect our ability to reprice customers because of credit in the future, we will take actions to mitigate that impact which we think is important to us remaining profitable. So, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we will take actions going forward that will mitigate the revenue losses that resulted from the credit act that was just passed.\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: But I also mean from the cost of funding as well.\nDaniel T. Henry : Well cost of funding right now?\nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group: Structurally the funding mixed has changed therefore you would argue that the pricing would change too.\nDaniel T. Henry : If you look at deposits for example which we\u2019re building up, the price of deposits is really pretty stable over time whether you\u2019re in a high interest rate environment or a low interest rate environment. So, we think by expanding that, that will be a positive. In terms of what the cost will be, when the credit markets reopen in a more fulsome way than they are now and what the spreads above benchmarks will be, quite frankly it\u2019s completely unclear.  Now, I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the likelihood that we\u2019ll move back to a period where we\u2019re paying 20 basis points above the benchmark is probably unlike but thinking that they would stay where they are today I would think is equally unlikely. The question is where in between there will it fall and quite frankly, I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see how the market develops but I think it\u2019s not unreasonable to think it will be at some level that\u2019s higher than we experienced over the last five years.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Can you help us think about the expectation to reinvest any gains from better credit relative to some of the targets you guys have out there specifically the one kind of post cycle that low 20% ROE? I\u2019m just trying to think about when that target applies or are we kind of in a wait and see mode?\nDaniel T. Henry : Well, I think while we\u2019ve seen some slight improvement here in credit metrics, I think we need to remember that our spending levels this quarter are still down double digits. Having lower billed business has a significant impact on our P&L. In addition to that, write off rates are at 10% and that has a significant impact. So, both spending will have to improve quite a bit and write off rates will have to improve quite a bit before we get to the point where we would be looking for normalized earnings or ROE. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Then I guess I was wondering on the improved delinquency trends, is there any way to extrapolate kind of what\u2019s being cyclically driven versus the seasonal impact because you guys had a lot of growth and some of the vintages that we\u2019re seasoning are kind of running off right so is there any way to isolate that element of the improvement in delinquencies?\nDaniel T. Henry : At this juncture clearly we\u2019ve been putting out fewer new cards than we have historically although that really has taken place over the last four quarters or so. Generally, credit losses from cards in the first six to nine months are very negligible so I think that will start to be more of a factor maybe when we get a couple of quarters out from here. Although, notwithstanding that I think it is a more tenured card base but I wouldn\u2019t describe it at this point that being a major factor in what we\u2019re seeing right now.  To go back to what you mentioned a minute ago, I just wanted to say that we haven\u2019t established a target for ROE at this juncture. We have simply said that we think when we get back to normalcy that the ROE target will be something north of 20%. Where it\u2019s actually going to settle will be very dependent on what capital requirements we have when we get back to a normal period. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Then I guess two just follow up questions, on this FAS 166, 167 is it fair to assume you guys will elect carrying value and not fair value?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think we are required to bring them back on to the books at fair value when they first come on.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: The liabilities?\nDaniel T. Henry : The answer is we have an option to value them at fair value, we will not do that.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Then just finally, do you have an updated number on kind of fixed versus variable dynamics on both the assets and liabilities side? I would assume the asset side would have become more variably driven, do you have an updated number on that?\nDaniel T. Henry : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve put out a new updated number although it\u2019s historically been around 60% variably funding. Now, having said that part of the fixed piece was balance transfers. Balance transfer activity as you know has declined precipitously so while we haven\u2019t updated the number, I think it\u2019s logical to think that the variable piece is probably higher and it would be something that we could well update as part of the 10Q.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I\u2019m assuming the liabilities, a lot of these deposits that you guys are taking are probably fixed, right?\nDaniel T. Henry : The liabilities we\u2019re taking are fixed.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Ken Bruce \u2013 Bank of America. \nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America: Could you elaborate on maybe some of your strategies around the cards in force, specifically are you planning to continue to take deactivated cards and essentially move them out? Was that a onetime adjustment you were trying to make to your risk management practices? What\u2019s the dynamic as it relates to obviously you\u2019ve got slower originations at this point or acquisitions, that may pick up as you reinvest but it looks like you\u2019re proactively trying to identify which customers within your portfolios you want to retain. Is that going to continue?\nDaniel T. Henry : I think we took the action on the in active customers, the concern was if someone was not using your product and then all of a sudden decided to activate after being dormant for 24 months, it could well be that it was driven by the fact that the customer had some credit issues and we wanted to really pull in the lines we had related to those customers because we viewed them as potentially risky. That was the motivating factor for that action although I\u2019d say that we periodically look at inactive accounts and decide whether we should cancel them or not. So that was the reason. As you note, cards in force is being impacted by investment levels although based on our forecast for write offs now we will be investing at a higher level in the third and fourth quarter than we previously planned.\nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America: Just to be clear, you don\u2019t necessarily have a program where you will continue to move out inactive cards without balances. That was more of a onetime and you may reassess that from time-to-time but that\u2019s not an ongoing program.\nDaniel T. Henry : So this was a onetime action although we will continue to review individual accounts that are inactive on a regular basis.\nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America: Within the context of the reduced average card spending, are there specific either demographics or any additional information you could provide in terms of what trends you are seeing within sub segments of your portfolio?\nDaniel T. Henry : We certainly look at that by category so certainly airline would be one category where pricing has dropped very significantly. There are other categories that have held up well but I think it\u2019s really pretty broad based and this might be something that we drill down to a little bit more at the financial community meeting that we\u2019re going to have in August.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.\nJason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: I actually just had a quick follow up question on the seasonality aspect, I know that seasonality tend to play a part through mid year and consumer credit trends so I guess I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on really what component of the delinquency improvement that you commented on earlier as being a key driver of your expectations here for later this year is being driven by this.\nDaniel T. Henry : Yes, I think we saw even when we had the first quarter earnings call that we had seen some improvement in the current 30 day past due roll rate. But at that juncture we thought it could well be just a seasonal move and so when we did our forecast for the balance of the year that was our thought process, it could be seasonal. We now have three more data points and we see that it is continuing at that improved level and so now that is influencing our view of the forecast for the balance of the year. So, it\u2019s really that change in terms of the roll rate from current to 30 days past due that\u2019s influencing the forecast.\nJason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: So it\u2019s more magnitude because it seems like some of the delinquency trends roll through maybe May, June data as well so maybe it\u2019s magnitude is what you are saying?\nDaniel T. Henry : Well, it\u2019s really the continuation of that trend that\u2019s causing to inform our estimate of the third and fourth quarter.\nJason Arnold \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Then just to follow up on one that Meredith had asked, I guess really with the rate hikes and line cuts you and others in the industry have been making, I was curious if you can share with us what you are seeing from a behavior shift in spending and account credit performance on these cards and accounts?\nDaniel T. Henry : It\u2019s very hard to correlate any one thing when so many other factors are moving. So, I would say the lower spending and the higher write off rates are largely being driven by the economy not the actions that we have taken in terms of card members. Certainly, there\u2019s some impact on spending and write off rates from the customer management actions we\u2019ve taken such as line reductions but I think the major factor here is the economy. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from Richard Shane, Jr. \u2013 Jefferies & Company.\nRichard Shane, Jr. \u2013 Jefferies & Company: Obviously everybody is pretty fixated on what\u2019s going on with spend and the notion that the declines are moderating. If I could just ask one question related to that, is the decline moderating sequentially May, June, July or is it moderating on a year-over-year basis just because June and July is when the trend last year started to become so negative?\nDaniel T. Henry : So we\u2019re looking at the sequential trend year-over-year. So we\u2019re comparing June year-over-year rate of decline to the year-over-year rate of decline in May. So, we have a May year-over-year rate of decline, if we do that same calculation for June and month-to-date July, there has been some slightly moderation in the decline.\nRichard Shane, Jr. \u2013 Jefferies & Company: What I\u2019m trying to figure out is last year sequentially from May to June did you see some sort of precipitous decline or some sort of decline and the reason that June 2009 looks a little bit better on a year-over-year basis versus May 2009 was only because June 2008 is such an easy comp?\nDaniel T. Henry : If you look historically over a number of years, generally there\u2019s a drop in billed business from May to June and we saw that last year which was consistent with seasonal trends. This year we did not see a drop from May to June so the billings in June were very similar to the billings that we saw in May and that\u2019s what\u2019s resulting in this slight moderation.\nOperator:  Your final question comes from Michael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners.\nMichael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: How should we think about the correlation of your charge off rate with the unemployment rate going forward? Do you think it will be more or less in line or do you think you\u2019ll perform better because some of the factors that were causing your credit performance to be worse than your peers are starting to succeed? I know you guys talked about the seasoning impact and having small business and the exposure to California and Florida. Are some of those factors starting to subs cede relative to your peers do you think?\nDaniel T. Henry : That\u2019s difficult to access at this juncture. What I would say is that our forecast from the third and fourth quarter is based on what we\u2019re seeing within American Express and what we\u2019re seeing in the roll rates. It\u2019s not being driven by forecasts of unemployment so it\u2019s our actual data and what we\u2019re anticipating within card members at American Express. Now, notwithstanding that, you look at that and then you look at the Blue Chip forecast for unemployment, now certainly if you went back to \u201991 or 2001, what we saw at that juncture was that write off rates both for the industry and for American Express peaked before unemployment peaked. Now, whether that\u2019s going to be the case this time or not, we\u2019re going to have to wait and see.\nMichael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Are you willing to give us some quantification of what the change in the reage policies have done for your delinquencies? The, could you also maybe give us \u2013 I know you securitized some loans during the quarter, what impact did that have on your provision?\nDaniel T. Henry : As it relates to the first question delinquencies have improved, the change in policy has an impact on that but if you excluded that change in policy, delinquencies would have improved in any event. Now, in terms of securitization, the securitization really doesn\u2019t have any impact on our provision, we are providing a credit provision for our owned receivables, that was driven by our own receivables not impacted by the actual securitization that we had in the month.\nMichael Taiano \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: So you don\u2019t release the reserve when you securitize the receivables off balance sheets?\nDaniel T. Henry : We do release the reserves but the provision you\u2019re looking at is for the owned assets that are on the books. Thank you everyone very much for joining the call.

Welcome to today\u2019s American Express Q1 \u201909 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded and will be made available for replay, and information regarding accessing that replay will be given at the end of today\u2019s conference. With that I\u2019d like to turn our conference over to our host today, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Ron Stovall. Please go ahead sir.\nRon Stovall: Okay. Thank you Dave and welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s discussion. As usual it\u2019s my responsibility to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s 2008 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the first quarter 2009 earnings release and earning supplement on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, as well as the presentation slides all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful for management and to investors. We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks Ron and I will start by taking us through the slides that we have provided. And I\u2019ll start on Slide 2, the summary of financial performance. So our revenues were 18% lower than last year on a GAAP basis. On a managed basis they were 11% lower and if you adjust for FX they were 7% lower than last year. Income from continuing operations was $443 million. That\u2019s down 68% but it does represent positive earnings. It also reflects the flexibility in our business model during these difficult economic times, and also the diversity of our businesses where we participate in the issuer, card processor and network pieces of the payment stream. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.32 and that is after our preferred dividend. Return on common equity came in at 16.7% and that\u2019s a calculation of rolling 12 months, so it\u2019s benefiting from the higher earnings that we had in the middle of 2008. Moving to Slide 3, our business metrics, you can see that billed business is down 16% on a reported basis and 12% on an FX adjusted basis. Now the decline in FX adjusted revenue growth from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was from a positive 7 to a negative 5 or a drop of 1,200 basis points and the change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is a drop of 700 basis points, so the rate of decline has lessened from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Looking at cards in force, network partner cards increased 18% and proprietary card growth was flat to average out to a 4% growth in cards in force. If we look at average basic cardmembers spend it decreased 14% on an FX adjusted basis, although I\u2019ll note on a positive note that transactions are only down 3%. If we look at cardmember loans, you can see that managed loans are down 11% on an FX adjusted basis, really in line with the decrease in FX adjusted billed business. Now later when we look at capital ratios, this relationship between the decrease in loans as relates to the slower spending will be very important when you think about a slowing economy and thinking about our capital ratios. If we move to Slide 4, you can see that discount revenue was down 18% although on a positive note our discount rate stayed at 2.56 which is only down 1 basis point from last year and is holding up very well. You can see that net card fee revenues are flat and that reflects the flat, proprietary cardmember that I cited a minute ago. When we look at net interest and securitization income, within that number securitization income decreased 68% as there were lower excess spread due to the higher write-off rates. Net interest income decreased only 5% on a GAAP basis. On a managed basis net interest income was actually up as lower loan balances were more than offset by wider spreads. If you look at travel commissions and fees, that is decreasing based on the economy and less spending both on a consumer and business basis. Other revenue decreases are really driven by just lower volumes. And I\u2019ll repeat that the total decrease of 18% is 7% when you do it on a managed FX adjusted basis. Let me move to Slide 5, provision for losses. You can see in total it increased 49%. Charge card while delinquency rates and write-off rates are up somewhat is really offset by the lower receivable levels which are being driven by lower spending levels. Cardmember lending rate is up \u2013 provision is up 75% on an owned basis as it\u2019s based on higher write-off rates, slightly higher delinquencies and a reserve build of over $400 million. And we\u2019ll cover this in more detail in a few slides. So looking at Slide 6 and our expense performance you can see that marketing function is down 42% and that reflects the difficult economic environment we have and the lower revenues that caused us to decide to reduce our marketing levels. The decrease in rewards expense of 18% is driven by volumes \u2013 the lower volumes. Lower salaries and benefits are a direct result of the reengineering actions that we launched in the fourth quarter of last year and is down 16%. Other operating expenses are down. Now this year includes the MasterCard payment that we received of $150 million that was not in the \u201908 quarter, and it also this year includes a $63 million benefit from fair valuing of hedges. But it also reflects the benefits of our reengineering actions. Now at the financial community meeting in February I spoke about the flexibility of our business model and this quarter is an execution of that flexibility as part of our focus to stay profitable. I also note that we\u2019re on track to achieve our $1.8 billion benefit that we targeted for 2009. That\u2019s a reengineering target. This reflects very strong expense control in the quarter. Moving to Slide 7, which are the USCS metrics, you can see that there is a 15% decrease in billed business. Now this decrease is in line with what we\u2019ve seen at our competitors and given the level of corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending in our business, you might think that we would come in below the competition but we did not. Now cards in force in this segment are down 1% and that reflects the impact of lower investment levels and the credit and collection actions that we\u2019ve taken. And to the extent we cancel inactive cards in the future, you know, this level of decrease may pick up a little bit in the coming quarters. Now the lower level of billed business is clearly being driven by the lower average spend by our customers as customers are simply spending less on each transaction. And again here you can see that the decrease in loans is tracking to the decrease in volumes that we see, which is a very good thing. Moving to Slide 8 ICS, international consumer, you can see billed business is down 5% on an FX adjusted basis. On an absolute basis this is better than the U.S. but it actually reflects similar trends. International spending held up pretty well through the third quarter of \u201908, which was 8% growth, then dropped to 1% growth in the fourth quarter and now is down 5%. And the decrease is really across all the regions at pretty consistent levels. If we look at cards in force its also being impacted by investment levels and the credit actions that we\u2019re taking, and if you look at average spend again this is a primary driver of the reduction in billed business. Again here cardmember loans are decreasing in line with lower volumes and travel is being impacted by the economy. We move to Slide 9 which is corporate services. Here billed business is down 18%. Again here this had held up pretty well through the third quarter but we saw some sharp drops in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter as the decision by corporations to hold back on spending is being reflected in these numbers. Now if we look at this by geography, volumes of billed business are down 19% in the U.S. and on an FX adjusted basis 15% outside the U.S. And again here its\u2019 across most regions. The one exception is Latin America was actually up a small amount. If we look at cards in force which actually increased by 6% we\u2019re seeing the benefits of card moving onto the American Express network as part of the CPS acquisition that we did last year. Again you can see that average spend is a large contributor to the drop in billed business and travel is being impacted by corporations restricting travel. Moving to Slide 10, which is global network and merchant services, here you can see that billed business is down 16%, 12% on an FX adjusted basis. U.S. retail and everyday spend, which represents about 71% of U.S. billings, decreased by 12% and U.S. [P and E] decreased by 20%. And here again you can see the average discount rate at 2.56% down only 1 basis point reflecting the value of our brand and our cardmember base. Now global network services billed business is down 6% on a reported basis, but is actually up 8% on an FX basis as cards issued by our partners riding on the American Express network increased by 18%. Now I note that the GNMS segment had net income of $237 million in the first quarter of \u201909 and that compares to $223 million in the first quarter of \u201908. And so you can see this segment is not impacted in a significant way by credit losses. It also shows the benefit of the diversity of our businesses. Moving to Slide 11, so this is charge credit net write-off rate, so the write-off rate in the first quarter is higher and it is a combination of lower receivables which decreased 19% over last year and so that\u2019s impacting the denominator in the calculation. And it\u2019s also reflecting higher write-offs related to the environment. It also reflects the seasonal build up of delinquencies which I\u2019ll show you on the next slide that are writing off in the first quarter, but I note that we have a provision for these as delinquencies billed. So moving to Slide 12, this is the charge card 30 day past due slide, and you can see that there\u2019s been an increase in 30 day past due in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year because of the difficult environment. But it also reflects a seasonal build up. If you look at this as instead of percentage actually look at past due dollars, you can see there were 3.7% in the first quarter of \u201909 and the write-off [inaudible] delinquency dollars are $571 million. That compares to the first quarter of last year. Even though it\u2019s the same rate delinquency dollars were $714 million. So you can see it\u2019s being heavily influenced by the lower volumes and the denominator impact. If we move to Slide 13, this is the charge card net loss rate for international consumer and commercial card. At international consumer you can see that the rate is increasing. This is really broad based across all countries and we have increased our provision accordingly. And again here the denominator is having a big impact as balances are down 21%. In global commercial card, again its up somewhat but it\u2019s really being heavily influenced by the denominator as receivables are down 25%. If we move to Slide 14, charge card 90 day past due for international consumer and commercial card, again here the denominator effect is having a large impact. If you look at delinquent dollars and you look at the fourth quarter, delinquent dollars were $173 million. And even though the percentage is higher in the fourth quarter delinquency dollars are lower at $155 million. If you look at global commercial card, again the rate is up from 1.7 last year in the first quarter to 2.4%, but if you look at the dollars in the first quarter of \u201909 and at 229, and that compares to 218 last year. So again a strong impact by the balance levels. A major point I want to make here as relates to charge provision this has really behaved very well as we can tightly control charge spending. So let me move to lending. Slide 15. So this is lending management write-off rate and as I indicated in January the first quarter was going to increase compared to the fourth quarter and as you\u2019ve seen already in the 8-Ks we filed at the time that we released the trust data, first quarter write-off rates are up. The 180 basis point increase is largely consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the industry. And it\u2019s a combination of an increase in write-off dollars which increased about $200 million compared to the fourth quarter, but here too you\u2019re seeing the denominator impact as average loans in the fourth quarter were $63 billion and in the first quarter dropped to $59.1 billion. If you look at international consumer, again we see an increase in the write-off rate but it\u2019s more modest and it\u2019s really spread across all geographies. If we move to Slide 16, this is looking at our numbers both on a reported basis and a lag basis. So by a lag basis I mean we\u2019ve compared the write-offs in this quarter with the balances six months ago. Now I know we always show coincidental numbers, and I don\u2019t want to just switch to lag because it\u2019s convenient for us, but I thought by showing you the slide you can see \u2013 we could demonstrate the impact that falling assets are having on the write-off rate. So if you go back to the first quarter of \u201908 the reported number was 4.3 but we were in a rising balance environment and if you did it on a lag basis it would be 4.7. But when you look at the first quarter of \u201909 and you look at it on a lag basis where we have falling assets, the calculation goes from 8.5% to 7.8%. So it has a pretty dramatic impact. So let me move to Slide 17. This is lending managed 30 day past due and again in the first quarter we have had an increase in 30 day past due, but I note that it\u2019s at a slowing rate. So if we went back to the second quarter the rate was 3.3% and it increased to 3.9 in the third quarter or a 60 basis point increase. It then increased to 4.7 in the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point increase. And now it\u2019s increased to 5.1 so it slowed to a 40 basis point increase. If you look at ICS, international consumer, internationally the economic environment has lagged the U.S. somewhat and so the fourth quarter is higher than we\u2019ve seen in past quarters in terms of growth rate and it\u2019s up 60 basis points. If we move to Slide 18, this is looking at our roll rates. So the top chart looks at current to 30 day past due and you can see that in January and February and March that it has improved. Now part of this improvement is seasonal, but we also think part of it is due to the credit and collection actions that we have taken. So if you are 30 days past due in March it means you were current in January. Okay? Now not on this chart current to just 30 days past billing. So that would be you haven\u2019t paid us in March but you were current in February. That percentage is also improving and in fact is at really historic lows. So that could be a positive sign, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a trend because it\u2019s one month. But it is something to note. If you look at the bottom part of the chart this is 30 days to write-off and as you can see the numbers here have stabilized in the fourth quarter, although we recognize it\u2019s at a high level. The one thing I want to note here is that there has been a change in systems so the calculation of this chart is slightly different than what we\u2019ve done in the past, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that in the first quarter these rates have stabilized. I guess one other thing I\u2019d note before leaving this chart is we have changed some of our collection practices to move more towards industry standards and have done some reengineering. But I want to note that that has not had a material impact on our delinquency levels. So let me move to Slide 19. Now since write-off rates have been receiving a significant amount of focus, we thought we would provide some additional information as it relates to write-off rates. Although obviously these are forecasts and subject to the environment, which could impact the assumptions we\u2019ve made here, but looking at our roll rates we would estimate that the first quarter of this year will increase between 200 and 250 basis points compared to the first quarter of \u201909. In the third quarter we think the increase will moderate and that the increase in the third quarter compared to the second quarter will be less than 50 basis points. Now as I said in the past, it is difficult to estimate write-off rates once you go beyond the next two quarters. So here we\u2019ve in looking at the fourth quarter based our estimate on where unemployment would go. So assuming unemployment reaches 9.7% in December, the fourth quarter write-off rate would be similar the third quarter. Now these reflect what we expect over the balance of the year based on roll rates with an eye to the blue chip forecast of unemployment and projected asset levels. At these write-off levels our goal is to generate profits in excess of our dividend. Moving to Slide 20, this looks at provision and if you look at the first quarter provision takes into account our models, our key metrics that we look at, the economic outlook. And we have increased our provision as a result of that based on the inherent risk in the portfolio. As you\u2019ll see on the next schedule, as a result of this we have increased our coverage ratios. So looking at Slide 21, now this is U.S. lending reserve coverage related to total loans outstanding. And as you can see, this coverage ratio has increased significantly over the last four quarters and in particular in this quarter, moving from 4% in the first quarter of \u201908 up to 8.9% in the first quarter of this year. Now not on this slide if we looked at reserves as a percentage of delinquencies on a worldwide basis, our coverage in the first quarter of \u201908 was 118% and now stands at 168%. Now some analysts look at coverage in terms of month\u2019s coverage of write-offs. If you were to look at that metric it has increased this quarter as well. The other thing I\u2019d note is that our reserve covers interest, principal and fees. Now some of our competitors have a reserve only related to principal, and we are looking at the possibility of in fact splitting our reserve between principal only and a separate reserve for interest and fees, and if we do that we may share that information in the second quarter. If you will look at it on that basis, then the reserve coverage ratio actually increases. Moving to Slide 22 and our capital ratios, as you can see here are tangible common equity to risk weighted assets which is one of the ratios that is being focused on in terms of capital strength, increased significantly this quarter from 8.5 in the fourth quarter up to 10.1% in the first quarter. Now there are a number of factors that contribute to this. First we have positive earnings. We have lower asset levels which helped the ratio. In addition to that, this includes OCI in capital and the mark to market on our [T3] portfolio is included in equity and that improved substantially during the quarter and had a positive impact on this ratio. In addition to that, the at risk weighted assets included amount for off balance sheet assets that we have and because we have higher levels of capital, the amount of risk weighted assets included in the first quarter is lower than the amount included in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s also having a positive impact on the ratio. But 10.1 is a very positive ratio compared to the industry. Now we\u2019ve also done a calculation on a pro forma basis of what tangible common equity over risk related assets would look like if the revisions to FAS 140 were actually in effect in the first quarter of \u201909 and you can see that on that basis it stands at 7.3% which again is a very strong ratio. I\u2019d also note that the other ratios on this page are comfortably above the well capitalized level. Now one other thing I want to mention again is when you think about capital ratios and you think about stress scenarios, you have a slowing economy which drives lower spending which drives lower asset balances. If you combine that with our flexible business model which can control the decrease in income, it actually has a positive impact on capital ratios. So let me move to Slide 23. Now what I just described in terms of the relationship between spending and asset balances is not just a theory. What this demonstrates is that when spending drops, asset levels drop with it. So if you look at the blue, solid line which is spending, when it drops the dotted blue line which lending managed loans drops right with it. And when you look at the yellow line and you see the drop in charge billed business, cardmembers receivables drop with it as well. Slide 22. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m on Slide 22 not Slide 23. Now the negative of falling asset levels is that spread revenue is negatively impacted. Also when you look at credit write-off rates you know there\u2019s a negative impact on the calculation because of the lower denominator. On the positive side though as assets drop you have reduced risk and when our assets dropped is a positive impact on capital ratios. Now turning to liquidity and looking at Slide 24. If you look at the top of this slide, it\u2019s really a roll forward of cash from December through March. So we started out with $21 million in cash. This reflects the proceeds from the issuance of the preferred shares to the government. It reflects the increase in our deposits. Now during this period receivables and loans decreased, so that\u2019s effectively a source of cash for us. We paid down some of our short term debt and we had maturities of long  term debt of $9 million and then we took about $5 billion of cash and invested it so it\u2019s included in our investment portfolio. So cash stood at $21 million at the end of the first quarter. Now we think about excess cash and readily marketable securities, we back out the cash we need for operating purposes of $2 billion. We also assume that we pay off any short term obligations we have in deposits. That\u2019s $4 billion. And then we add in the liquidity investment portfolio of $10. So we have excess cash and readily marketable securities of $25 billion. So for this purpose as we think about deposits, any deposit that at issuance has maturity of less than 12 months we actually include on this line here when we think about excess cash and readily marketable securities. So with that, let me move to Slide 25 which is the maturities that we\u2019re going to see over the next four quarters. So here you can see the maturities of long term debt. The off balance sheet column reflects the securitizations that will mature over the next 12 months. And in the next column are certificates of deposit which at issuance had a maturity of greater than one year, and this reflects how much of those will mature over the next 12 months. So a total of $23.5 billion. So our excess cash is more than 12 months worth of maturities and we intend to maintain that on a rolling basis as we go forward. So at the bottom of this chart we also just indicated a sensitivity to change in this should really be receivables and loans, so if they decrease by 1% it would actually have a benefit of reducing our funding needs by $1 billion. If they decrease by 10% it would reduce our funding needs by $9.5 billion. So moving to Slide 26 and just a little bit more information about our brokered retail deposits. So retail CDs we started with $6.2 billion at the beginning of the quarter. $1 billion matured during the quarter. We raised $4.1 billion of new retail CDs so at the end of the quarter we had $9.3 billion outstanding. The average duration was 24 months and the average rate was 2.4%. Now if you\u2019ll look at the $4.1 that we raised during the quarter, the average duration is 25 months and the average rate on that is 2.1%. So when you look at retail CDs plus the brokerage sweep accounts, we had deposits of $17 billion at the end of the first quarter. And as we look forward in terms of our funding needs, assuming the economy stays weak, the majority of our funding will be met by raising deposits. So if you look at Slide 27 I just wanted to point out the additional funding sources we have. So we have deposits. On the TALF program we have a capacity of $9.8 billion. We would anticipate utilizing a limited amount of TALF during the balance of the year. But we also have the TLGP program and I know it expires later this year but for a large fund year it\u2019s a capacity we have. Certainly if the markets were to rebound we could utilize commercial paper or other unsecured debt. And we have the contingent sources of the discount window plus our bank facilities. So with that, let me make a few summary comments. So for 2009 we remain focused on our three key priorities, to stay liquid; to stay profitable; and to selectively invest for the long term. We believe we are making good progress against each of these goals. Attaining them should position us to emerge from this slowdown in a strong competitive position. F From a liquidity perspective we had $25 billion of excess cash and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter, an amount well above our projected funding needs over the next 12 months. We continue to build our U.S. retail deposit base as we increased our deposits by $3.5 billion and at the end of March, with total U.S. retail deposits of $17 billion. We are also on track with our previous announced launch of our direct deposit program later in the quarter. This program will further expand our deposit taking capabilities. During 2009 based on the assumption that the credit markets will remain challenging, we plan to fund our activities primarily through deposits, but we may also utilize a small portion of the $9.8 billion of capacity that we have under the governments\u2019 term asset based security loan facility. We believe this strategy will position us to meet our goals of holding excess cash and readily marketable securities equal to the next 12 months of maturities on a rolling basis. Other funding sources include the government, temporary liquidity guarantee program, the Fed discount window and our bank credit facilities, and these provide further support if needed. During our quarter when others in the card industry were incurring substantial losses, we remained profitable and generated $443 million of earnings from continuing operations. These results reflect the competitive strength of our diverse business model, given the multiple roles we play as the payment issuer, processor and network provider. Additionally they underscore the flexibility of the model and our ability to adapt to a very difficult economic environment, characterized by slower spending levels and higher unemployment. As we expected, cardmember spending was under considerable pressure throughout all of our business activities. The overall year-over-year spending decline remained fairly consistent through the quarter and April to date. In light of our proportionately greater level of corporate and consumer discretionary spending, we continue to feel good about the relative level of our business activity compared to other major card competitors. As we previously reported through our monthly credit related 8-K filings, credit weakened further in the quarter as write-off rate and past due amounts rose well above year end 2008 levels. While these metrics reflect high levels of dollar write-offs, they are also impacted by the negative denominator impact of lower lending balances. This decline in loans reflects the flow through effect of lower levels of consumer spending in this difficult environment, in addition to the pro active credit actions that we have implemented. These actions and seasonal trends appear to have contributed to the recent improvement in the current to 30 roll rate, although it\u2019s premature to call this a trend. We believe that second quarter U.S. managed write-off rates will be higher than first quarter levels. Based on projected roll rates and an expected decline in loans, we estimate between a 200 and 250 basis point increase in second quarter U.S. managed write-off rates. In the third quarter we expect them to rise much more modestly, likely less than 50 basis points. We believe the fourth quarter managed write-off rate will be similar to the third quarter assuming that the U.S. unemployment rate reaches 9.7% by December. These write-off rates assume that the actual dollar write-off rises in the second quarter but remains relatively flat in the third and fourth quarter. Our operating expense trends in the quarter clearly show the flexibility that we have been able to achieve through reengineering activities. During the quarter we continued to implement the $1.8 billion program announced last October and based on our progress to date we are on track to realize the target benefit this year. We remain committed to our profitability goal, so in light of the economic uncertainty still in front of us we put additional expense related initiatives in place during the quarter and we are planning to implement another round of actions including staff reductions in the second quarter. We are also benefiting from the revenue enhancement put in place over the last two quarters, and we are realizing the benefits related to our sizable variable rewards expense base and the discretionary aspects of our marketing and promotion expenditures. As we evaluate our investment decisions throughout this year, we will be working to prudently balance near term performance against long term profitability and growth. Despite the reduced amount of investments, we feel good about the long term opportunities within the areas that investments are focused on such as our expanded delta partnership and various B2B initiatives. While the current economic weakness will continue to negatively impact our results, our goal remains to position the company to generate profits in excess of our dividend and we are working hard to achieve that income. At the same time we recognize that this is a difficult and [inaudible] operating environment. Our tangible common equity to risk weighted asset ratio of 10.1% is relatively high versus most of the bank holding companies. Our Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 14.8% as well as our other regulatory ratios are comfortably above the well capitalized threshold. This positions us well for the difficult period that still lies ahead and the potential consolidation of our off balance sheet receivables under the proposed FAS 140 revisions. As Ken noted in the earnings release, if permitted by our supervisors and if supported by the results of the stress assessment, our intent is to repay the CPP capital provided by the Treasury. In closing, our business model comprises a diverse set of activities that span the payment industry. Our brand is an important asset that is recognized and respected around the globe. Our premium cardmember base remains a key advantage as it retains the capacity to grow spending substantially when the economy improves. Our balance sheet is positioned with capital funding and a liquidity profile that should provide us with the flexibility in these volatile times. And across all our businesses we have instilled a strong focus on the customer, someone we need to stay close to regardless of the environment. Thanks for listening and we\u2019re now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Foran: I think the expense flexibility was surprisingly good in the quarter I think for a lot of people. As we look out into the rest of the year is there more expense flexibility if revenues continue to decline or are we bumping up against a level where you reach as low as you can go?\nDaniel T. Henry: So as I indicated I think that we recognize that the environment is going to continue to be difficult. We\u2019re going to work very hard to execute against the reengineering that we put in place in the fourth quarter of last year so that we get the full benefit as we go through this year. But as I indicated we actually are going to have another round of reengineering, have additional actions including additional reductions in staff. So we do think there\u2019s additional flexibility in our business model and we will utilize those levers. We look at some of the other line items like rewards, you know that\u2019s going to be driven by where our spending levels are and it\u2019s just another one of the aspects of the flexibility of our business model. So yes we have the ability to continue to utilize discretionary decisions and continue to demonstrate that our business model is flexible.\nBrian Foran: And then as a follow up, there\u2019s a lot obviously going on in Washington. There was just recently a meeting obviously. Is there any update you can give us in terms of legislative and regulatory risks where those might be increasing or decreasing?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don\u2019t have an update of the events that took place today. We had a representative at the meeting at the White House. We certainly take very seriously the concerns that are expressed about the industry and we look to work constructively with the administration and Congress toward a productive solution. And while we\u2019re mindful of the calls for reform, we think it\u2019s important that we look at all things and strike the right balance between consumer protection and the availability of credit to the general population.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli: On the expense savings just would like maybe a little bit more color as we move to the other side of this recession eventually. Of the cuts that you\u2019ve been able to make and the reengineering, how much of that is sticky? So are we going to see significant operating leverage on the other side of this, beyond what we have seen historically? And what do you lose? I mean, these are substantial expense cuts that you had laid out pretty clearly going into this year, but what are you cutting into the muscle at all? And how are you \u2013 maybe give me some color on that.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So as we look at the reengineering that we do, a large portion of it is very sticky. So if you look at the reductions we\u2019ve made in our staffing levels, we are not doing that solely for the short term. Surely there\u2019s a benefit in the short term but as we look into the future, when things do turn around \u2013 eventually they\u2019ll turn, we think in all likelihood the saving rate of individuals will be higher. We think people have less value in their homes. So when it turns and gets better, we may not return to the levels that we saw in \u201906 and \u201907 and so we want to construct a cost base that will enable us to be competitive and to invest and enable us to gain share just the way we did over the last several years. There are some aspects to it which are cuts that are just for the short term that will come back, but I would say a large portion has stickiness and are really designed for the future and the future growth over the long term. Now we are always very careful not to cut into the muscle. We would not take actions that would hurt our ability to perform well when things start to turn. So we\u2019re very conscious of that. So we think that the cuts that we have made as I say will put us in good stead in the future. They\u2019re very helpful in the short term and they won\u2019t negatively impact our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nRobert Napoli: And just a follow up on credit, if I could. American Express has more exposure as we all know in California and Florida and some of the housing states where you have higher income as well. And I think maybe credit started to go bad in the fourth quarter of \u201907 maybe a little bit ahead of the competition because of your exposure in some of those states. And as you\u2019re looking closely and I think you tightened sooner than others did because of that, when you\u2019re looking at your roll rates improving and understanding your seasonality and it\u2019s too early to get too constructive on that, but are you seeing signs of improvement, more so in states that went bad earlier because of the tightening? Where are you seeing that improvement?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I would say that early in the cycle I think that housing was a significant driver of higher delinquencies and write-off rates, and certainly did see that in the states that had larger drops in housing. However, at this juncture I really think that unemployment has taken over as the primary driver of delinquency and write-off rates. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll need to see for a real turn. I think stabilization in the housing market will be important. I think consumer confidence will be critically important. People will have to start comfortable that they\u2019re going to retain their job. And when those things start to happen I think is when we\u2019ll really start to see some notable improvements.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc. Craig Maurer - Calyon Securities (USA) Inc. Regarding your billed business I was wondering if you could quantify if at all the effect in the comparison that Easter had on your comparison with the prior year and if that would provide an easier comparison in the second quarter than you had in the first with Easter falling in April this year?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so internally we have huge discussions about the impact of Easter and there\u2019s a camp that would view it as having a positive impact, others will view it the other way. People have different views depending on geography. At the end of the day I don\u2019t think it had a huge impact on the drop in spending that we saw in the first quarter, nor do I think it will have a large impact in April. You know, as I said I think the decrease in billings was pretty consistent over the quarter and continued into April to date.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti: I just wanted to follow up on the improvement in the delinquency numbers. I think a lot of investors and folks in the business seem to think that most of that\u2019s due to seasonality, but it sounds like maybe there\u2019s a little bit more afoot at AXP. I was wondering if you could dig into that a little bit? Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: So it\u2019s hard to tease apart what\u2019s seasonality and what are the actions we\u2019re taking. You know, we believe that the improvement we see is both somewhat seasonal and also somewhat related to the actions we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019ve noted that in the month of March, particularly in the roll rate from current to 30 days past billing, there was an improvement and really we\u2019re at historic lows there. But I want to be very careful not to take that and overstate it, because I don\u2019t think a month or even two months is a trend and I think we\u2019d have to see how this plays out over the next several months before we want to declare a victory here. So to one data point I think we need to keep in mind that our write-off rates are up dramatically this quarter from last quarter. As I described they\u2019re going to be up again next quarter and so I think we need to take all those things into consideration as you kind of evaluate where we are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Drilling down on that credit quality question again, I want to make sure I understand what specifically makes you comfortable with the charge-off guidance? Is it that you expect the rate of delinquencies increasing to continue at a slower pace than you\u2019ve seen in the past? Or is it that you expect lower roll rates? And maybe you could just touch on international as well and your expectations there? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So when we look at the second quarter our view is heavily driven by what we see in the roll rates. So we have a pretty good view of watching the leader buckets and we can look at historical performance as well as where that may go in light of the economy. So that is really driven heavily by looking at roll rates. When you get to the third quarter, again we can look at our roll rates, we can see what\u2019s moved into the 30 day past due, 60 day past due, 90 day past due. So we have a sense of what\u2019s in those buckets and again we look at historical numbers as well as where we think the economy is going. So there it\u2019s a mix of roll rates and kind of what the blue chip indicator is saying about unemployment that forms our view of what will take place in the third quarter. And when we get to the fourth quarter it\u2019s really based on looking at the blue chip, which is saying that consensus which is saying that unemployment will reach 9.5. You know we bumped that up a little to 9.7. But that fourth quarter estimate is really based on an unemployment assumption. I Dan Henry am not forecasting that that\u2019s going to be the number, we simply utilized the blue chip to make that type of a judgment. So that\u2019s the basis for the information we\u2019re providing. As we look at international as I said that seems to be a little bit behind the U.S. and so we see delinquencies climbing there. We see write-off rates higher. We\u2019ve increased our provision accordingly and it\u2019s really a cross over geographies and we\u2019re watching it very closely, taking credit and collection actions just like we are in the United States. And so we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out over the next several quarters.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Could you expand on your statement in the release on wanting to pay back TARP? What drives that thought process and how does that tie into your views on utilizing some of the other programs? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So we\u2019ve always viewed TARP as a temporary program. It was established at a time of extraordinary stress in the financial system and was designed to insure that participating banks were in a position to provide access to credit facilities that were needed to get the economy back on its feet. We have been doing that and believe we can continue to expand those activities responsibly, even after repaying TARP. We believe it\u2019s in the best interest of American Express and good public policy to return TARP after the stress test process has been completed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler: One of the things that I think is remarkable about this quarter is the stabilization you\u2019ve seen in the credit metrics. I know that you\u2019ve been doing a lot of repricing, just pulling back on lines and the reduction in balances has been significant. Do you think that some of the stabilization you might be seeing in some of those roll rates might be related to you\u2019ve sort of gotten through the worst of those actions? Or are you still aggressively pulling back on the portfolio? And then a follow up question would be, in the charge card business you\u2019ve talked a lot about the outlook for the credit card portfolio. Charge card metrics look pretty good and I think you mentioned that. What is your outlook there? Do you think that this portfolio will continue to experience much less deterioration or does it have a little bit of a lag? I think you also talked about the delinquency rate being I think flat or down year-over-year, but doesn\u2019t that have something to do with the fact that you\u2019ve changed your charge-off policy at least in the U.S. charge card? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I\u2019ll start at the beginning. You may have to help me if I don\u2019t hit all these questions, but what we\u2019re seeing in balances is largely being driven by spending. So we have a very different model than the competitors. They have really a lend-centric model. Ours is spend-centric. So spread revenue is much more a piece of our total business. So we have made available credit to creditworthy customers. They have decided that they are going to spend less and when they spend less we are seeing a reduction in our balances. So while it\u2019s also being impacted by the credit actions we\u2019re taking which we think are prudent and responsible given the environment, the largest impact on our loans and receivables is being driven by the fact the customers are spending less. So we have over the course of the last year put in credit actions that we felt were appropriate. We continue to look at both credit as well as collection actions that we think make sense. And in this environment in some cases we\u2019ve moved more towards industry standard practices, which we think will have a positive economic benefit over time. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving those decisions.\nChristopher Brendler: Are you talking about re-aging when you make that comment?\nDaniel T. Henry: When I talk about that comment I talk about kind of our care program, how we interact with customers who are struggling, in some cases we are forgiving certain fees and the like. So there\u2019s a number of different programs that we have in place. If as a result of our policies customers comply with those and they re-age, then that\u2019s a result of their behaviors as it relates to our policy. Again we\u2019ve moved to some policies that are closer to industry standard. I guess I\u2019d emphasize that the amount of re-aging that\u2019s taken place in the quarter has not had a significant impact on any of our metrics.\nChristopher Brendler: Okay then. Charge cards?\nDaniel T. Henry: So in terms of just going to charge you talked about us changing our charge policies, I\u2019m not really \u2013\nChristopher Brendler: When you go from 360 to 180?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, yes we did. So we did do that absolutely in the fourth quarter we did that. And now we\u2019re a bank holding company that\u2019s something we need to do. But that really doesn\u2019t have any impact on either our provision, we\u2019ve restated I think our metrics, so I do not think that\u2019s having any significant impact.\nChristopher Brendler: Just finally the outlook for charge? I mean do you think it continues to materially outperform the credit portfolio and it\u2019s obviously a very differently underwritten portfolio. You mentioned that you voted to control spending. Just give me a little color on how that ability limits your exposure there. I think if I\u2019m not correct, correct me please, but I think the charge card portfolio was worse in the \u201901, \u201902 downturn relative to where you\u2019re sitting today. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.\nDaniel T. Henry: I think charge card is a product that\u2019s pay in full. You know we have the ability at any time to stop a customer at points of sale. We have a tremendous history of experience here and we have the ability to tightly control this. As you\u2019ve seen our experience has been very good, the provision is only up modestly and we would anticipate the ability to continue to control charge card in a similar way to the way we have in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Wessel - J.P. Morgan.\nAndrew Wessel: I just had a quick follow up from I guess a comment that was made at the Investor Day. I believe it was said that in a 9.5 and that was back a couple of months ago so it was a 9.5, 10% unemployment environment that it would be difficult to remain profitable. Was that comment made just in the card business, the U.S. card business itself? Or was that a broader comment about that as a consolidated business and then what\u2019s changed if that\u2019s the case?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So honestly I don\u2019t remember having said that, that it would be hard to profitable in a 9.5 or 10% unemployment range. So certainly if you look at the estimates that I discussed today, we\u2019re assuming that unemployment gets up to 9.7% in December and with that environment it\u2019s our goal to stay profitable and to have generate earnings in excess of our dividend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Hochstim - Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim: I wonder, Dan, could you relate your comment about dollar charge-offs in the second and third quarters to the reserve build for worldwide lending in the quarter? Is that \u2013 I mean if you think about the $440 million increase in reserves that\u2019s anticipating some higher dollar charge-offs over the next 12 months and yet you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not going up very much? So should there be no provision, no reserve build after the first quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we are expecting that as we\u2019ve disclosed write-offs will go up. I would anticipate that as credit worsens, if we actually see credit worsening that we will continue to see appropriate provision levels and could well be that there are further builds in the reserves as we go forward.\nDavid Hochstim: Should we assume that the dollar increase you\u2019re talking about from Q1 to Q2 and charge-offs would lead into a big portion of that reserve build this quarter or?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think we will have high write-offs but we also anticipate a build in reserves.\nDavid Hochstim: And then could you give some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from cardmembers and spending in the U.S. or outside the U.S. and charge card versus lending products, in terms of changes in behavior? I think you talked in the past about fewer big ticket purchases, but what are you seeing in terms of T&E or non-T&E spending? How do those things factor into the changes in billed business?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I think the largest impact that we\u2019re seeing is in average spend. You know, you can see almost segment by segment that the decreases in billed business closely correlate to decreases in average spend. People \u2013 transactions were only down 3%, so that\u2019s a positive. People are still taking the card out of the wallet. They\u2019re still using it but they\u2019re choosing to spend less per transaction. You know, I think that is really the story. Now in the U.S. we saw that non-T&E so retail and everyday spend was down about 12% and T&E spend was down 20%. And beyond that I think we continue to see this as broad based across all segments, all products. And that\u2019s continuing.\nDavid Hochstim: Are you seeing bigger declines from some [inaudible] and centurion cardholders in percentage terms or everybody\u2019s at the average?\nDaniel T. Henry: I don\u2019t see that any one group is performing dramatically different than the others. I think it\u2019s broad based.\nDavid Hochstim: And to Chris\u2019s question, no difference between regions?\nDaniel T. Henry: You know, if you look internationally on an FX adjusted basis we were down 5% and quite frankly in consumer business it was pretty evenly spread, the decrease across all the regions. On an FX adjusted basis in commercial card it was across most regions. The only exception was Latin America where it was up a very small amount. So it is broad based across products, it\u2019s broad based across segments and it\u2019s broad based across geographies. Now again geography, 5% FX adjusted outside the U.S. compared to in the U.S. it\u2019s about 15%. So greater in the U.S. but we are seeing impacts internationally and internationally it\u2019s broad based.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Carcache - Fox-Pitt Kelton.\nBill Carcache: Can you comment I believe it had been since 2001 since you had last sold charge-off debt and in I believe the 8-K from this past with the March credit data you\u2019d indicated that you\u2019d sold some charge-off debt. Can you say how much that benefited the charge-off rate and the extent to which you might have some additional inventory that you could use in the future to help offset losses there? And then I have a follow up as well.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think we said it\u2019s been a number of years since we\u2019ve done it. I don\u2019t know that the last time we did it was \u201901. It is a common industry practice and we\u2019ve made a decision that we think there is the proper economics associated with doing it, so we did it this quarter and I would anticipate that we would continue to do it in the future as long as we think there are good economics around that decision. So it\u2019s a practice that we may well continue.\nBill Carcache: Can you tell us what the reserve rate was that you used in the 140 disclosure that you made about the capital ratios? And then separately the final question is related to the allowance. So is it right then since you\u2019re using 9.7% unemployment, is it right that if unemployment does not exceed 9.7% then you\u2019re adequately reserved as of right now and you don\u2019t need to book additional reserves?\nDaniel T. Henry: Those are two different questions. So the reserve rate to bring assets back on the balance sheet would be the rate we have in the owned portfolio. Okay? In terms of what we reserve going forward, we\u2019ll be dependent on the risk we assess in the portfolio at the end of each quarter. So it\u2019s a combination of what we see in write-offs, what we see in our model in terms of migration to loss. It\u2019s what we see in terms of coverage ratios whether it be for total loans, for delinquencies, we look at full coverage of write-offs and how much coverage we have. We look at a wide variety of indicators and based on that we set the reserve balance at the end of each quarter so as we move forward the expense or provision in each quarter will reflect write-offs in the quarter and it will reflect the apparent risk in the portfolio and I would anticipate that there would be a reserve build as we go forward throughout the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Richard Shane - Jefferies & Co.\nRichard Shane: I didn\u2019t catch the answer to the first part of Bill\u2019s question about what were the impact of the portfolio sales on the first quarter loss rate?\nDaniel T. Henry: You didn\u2019t hear it because I didn\u2019t answer it, which wasn\u2019t my intent to not address the question. So the way I addressed the question is to say it had a minimal effect. It\u2019s not an amount we\u2019re disclosing but it did not have a significant impact on the metrics.\nRichard Shane: Our attention is being drawn to the lag loss data because of the denominator fact and what\u2019s going on in the portfolio in terms of shrinkage. When you give the outlook in terms of projected changes to the loss rates over the next couple of quarters, how much of that is explained by denominator effect and how much is explained by your expectations on credit?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think what we should expect is that write-off dollars in the second quarter will increase and then we think write-off dollars will stay relatively flat in the third and fourth quarter. And the write-off forecast also as a projection at bad asset levels. And if spending decreases than that is going to have an impact on the denominator effect. So it\u2019s a combination of both higher write-off dollars and what we\u2019re forecasting in terms of asset levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bruce Harting - Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting: Your Slide \u2013 what number was that? The one concerning the FAS 140 was fascinating. Just the TCE to RWA, is the significance of that is that the calculation that\u2019ll be used for the stress test, Dan or that just?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, that\u2019s Slide 23. So the stress test we provided a variety of information under the stress test, but it\u2019s our understanding that they will focus on Tier 1 ratios and they will also focus on tangible common equity over risk weighted assets. That\u2019s an assumption. We have not gotten back yet their findings.\nBruce Harting: You answered already that the reserve rate is based on the owned portfolio assumption but down in the footnote there where you say that the TCE change is $1.1 billion, that\u2019s just the after tax impact of that number you specified, the owned portfolio reserve rate after tax? Is that what that is?\nDaniel T. Henry: It\u2019s primarily the reserve we put up tax [inaudible] but there may be some other small items in there, but it\u2019s primarily that.\nBruce Harting: And then the RWA increase of $20 billion, of $20.5 that\u2019s not really the difference right now between managed and owned. That\u2019s a different number?\nDaniel T. Henry: It is. I mean it\u2019s basically \u2013 it reflects what is already in the calculation for off-balance sheet assets, which is the differential in essence between that number and the full amount of securitized loans today.\nBruce Harting: And then just switching gears a little, I just tried to run the math on the translation of GAAP to managed here but I just noticed it\u2019s pretty remarkable that your yield is up about 200 basis points on a linked quarter and about 100 of that\u2019s on a year-over-year. Can you just comment on do you expect that the average cost of funds \u2013 it looks like you\u2019ve had about a 46% decline year-over-year in your cost of interest so should we expect any continuation or decline in you cost of funds? And it looks like you\u2019ve had about a 15% decline excluding foreign exchange in balances, so interest income\u2019s down about 17% so it looks like you\u2019ve held the interest income pretty flat. Are those kind of trends which are very good sustainable through the balance of the year, i.e., lower funding costs and kind of flat interest income?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, it\u2019s going to be driven by where interest rates go in the future so it\u2019s very dependent on the market and where the benchmark rates are. And that\u2019s what\u2019ll drive interest as we go forward.\nBruce Harting: So it wasn\u2019t just a function of longer dated \u2013 the rollover of longer dated liabilities that have run their course? I mean, looking at your rate schedule it looks like you still have a fairly substantial amount of longer dated funding rolling which should be beneficial through the balance of the year.\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, it all depends on lots of things like what our funding needs are in terms of what we fund it with. So there\u2019s numerous factors here. It\u2019s like where the benchmark rates are. It depends on where asset levels are. It depends on what the mix is between deposits and other sources of funding that are available to us. So there\u2019s a myriad of factors that are going to go into that. As I said before based on the current economic environment, we would think a majority of our funding is going to come from deposits although it\u2019s likely that we will use a small portion of the capacity that\u2019s available under TALF.\nBruce Harting: I mean kind of looking at the managed numbers stated simply year-over-year you\u2019ve had about a $0.5 billion increase in provision, $0.5 billion decrease in discount revenue but you\u2019ve had about $1 billion decline in expenses to offset that. And then a little bit of a benefit on the net interest margin line.\nDaniel T. Henry: Well you know it\u2019s very much about the business model we have and the flexibility that we think we have in that model. I took a fair amount of time at the financial community to talk about that and I think this quarter actually reflects us executing against that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Stilmar - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.\nJohn Stilmar: I wanted to talk a little bit about spending if you would and it\u2019s certainly not a surprise to have double digit down year-over-year declines in spending given the contraction in both the wallets of consumers as well as in your portfolio. Can you talk to me about the pace of deterioration and is the pace of deterioration in spending continuing to \u2013 is it accelerating, staying about the same or have we at least seen in the pace of deterioration level off at least through April and then how has it occurred through the quarter? And if you could differentiate those comments between the credit card and charge card business I\u2019d be appreciative. Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, so we\u2019ve seen spending down on an FX adjusted basis 12% or 16% on a reported basis. But on a FX adjusted basis if we look at the quarter it\u2019s been very consistent over each month in the quarter that number. And that level of spending decline has continued into April.\nJohn Stilmar: How do you compare between charge card and credit card or are you not seeing any difference?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, you can look at Slide 22 and it gives you some idea of the difference in the decline in spending between lending and charge.\nJohn Stilmar: Finally, one of the things that you alluded to on analyst day was a lack of \u2013 there was more of a focus on internally with regards to the company and not really a focus externally. Have you thought any more about potential acquisitions of adjacent businesses or specifically in more the spending side of your business rather than the credit side as you move forward, or is it still very much executing on your business model internally and not necessarily looking at acquiring additional capacity or other businesses on the payment side?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I don\u2019t think our view has changed here. I think we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in our core businesses to fuel our growth. We think the businesses that we\u2019re in have a lot of growth opportunity whether it\u2019s on the issuing side or on the network side. And we\u2019ve always been open to acquisitions which are kind of bolt ons that would help achieve our long term goals and the growth of the company. And I would think we would continue. In fact, we\u2019ve done some of those over the last couple of years and I think we would continue to have the same philosophy as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.\nScott Valentin: Two questions. First, with regard to the pricing actions you took in January, raising rates on I think it was 55% of the card holders, have you seen any noticeable change in behavior in that cohort that you raised rates on?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 we certainly are very focused on that and we are monitoring it very closely. You know, quite frankly it\u2019s probably a little too early if we\u2019re going to see some impact but we really haven\u2019t seen impact to date, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re tracking very closely I can assure you.\nScott Valentin: You mentioned additional reengineering efforts in 2Q and I guess can you principally size it relative to the one you took in 4Q with regard to a charge or potential reengineering goal cost saves for the second initiative?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. We were in the process of deciding what actions we\u2019re going to take. We need to do that very thoughtfully. We need to plan it. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s taking place right now, so I really can\u2019t size it for you. When we\u2019ve done that work and decided on the actions, you know, we\u2019ll make an announcement.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Robert Napoli - Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli: Just looking at the growth and decline in loans through the first quarter, I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of color on your intentions or thoughts and what you\u2019re seeing and what you expect in the rate of decline of your managed loans in the U.S. and abroad and credit card \u2013 your charge card receivables as well?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think Bob that\u2019s going to be heavily driven by the spending levels that we see in the future. Again if you look back on Slide 22, there\u2019s a very tight correlation between loan balances and spending on lending products and a very tight correlation in terms of receivables linked to spending on the charge card. So I think where those balances go are going to be driven by spend and spend in all likelihood will be very driven by what\u2019s taking place in the economy.\nRobert Napoli: But given that you said that spend that the trend has stabilized through April, does that mean that you would expect the rate of decline of your loans to start to slow significantly as I mean that also has a significant effect on I mean you\u2019re talking about charge-off percentages, that percentage has to have a denominator associated with it?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well certainly the write-off rate is a function of two things, right? It\u2019s write-offs in the period which are in the numerator and it\u2019s where loan balances go in the denominator. So certainly as we\u2019ve seen in the material we\u2019ve presented that when you have a declining balance sheet that has  a negative impact on the write-off rate. So really it depends \u2013 at the end of the day it really depends - I\u2019ll go back to the beginning of my answer, it really depends very much on where spending goes. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive this to a large degree.\nRobert Napoli: But what are you seeing? I mean are you seeing a slowdown? I mean you have a forecast of loans. Are you still seeing the same rate of decline?\nDaniel T. Henry: So in the month of April the decrease in spending was the same as what we saw in the first quarter.\nRobert Napoli: And does that mean loans have stabilized? I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get to. You\u2019re saying that the rate of decline in spending has stabilized. Does that mean that the rate of decline in loans should therefore slow down from what we have seen?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I think, you know, when spending is down you\u2019re going to see balances decline. If spending were equal year-over-year based on history it would imply that loans at that point would stay at a similar level. But if spending increases the balance is going to go up. Spending declines, period over period they\u2019re going to go down.\nRobert Napoli: Just for clarification on the TARP, requesting to repay the TARP. You intend to do that without raising additional equity, capital?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I would say that\u2019s kind of jumping ahead. We haven\u2019t really received the results of the stress test. We haven\u2019t completed our conversations with the regulators, so I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate on that point. I just say my own view is that we have a very strong capital position.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: All right. Thanks everybody. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you sir.

[Operator Instructions] I'd like to now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall. Please go ahead.\nRon Stovall: Okay. Thanks, Anne, and welcome, everybody. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. As usual, it's my honor to present to you some legal information and that is that the discussion today contain certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company's 2009 10-K report and 2010 first, second and third quarter 10-Q reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the fourth quarter 2010 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describe certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points relating to the quarter's earnings with a series of slides included with the earnings document distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to enter the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask questions.  While we will attempt respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel Henry: Okay. Thanks, Ron. As you all know, last Wednesday, January the 19th, we announced our EPS for the fourth quarter of 2010. We have made certain decisions regarding reengineering, and we plan to start to notify employees and therefore, we had an SEC disclosure obligation. Instead of leaving an open question for you to figure out in terms of how to think about the fourth quarter EPS considering the reengineering charge, we decided to announce EPS. Looking at Slide 2, you can see that revenues are up 13%. But I remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2009, we still had securitized receivables that were off-balance sheet. Therefore, the more meaningful revenue growth is the managed total revenue net of interest expense of 4%. You can see that income from continuing operations was slightly over $1 billion, $1,062,000,000, and EPS was $0.88 and ROE had climbed to 27%.  If we look at Slide 3, we see that the reengineering costs in the fourth quarter on a pretax basis was $113 million. On an after-tax basis, the impact on net income was $74 million or $0.06. If you adjust for that reengineering cost, EPS was $0.94. I'll remind you that the reengineering related primarily to a decision to consolidate locations within our company's global servicing network. We plan to close Greensboro, North Carolina, and transfer that work to other locations in the United States: Fort Lauderdale, Salt Lake City and Phoenix. We also plan to close Madrid after a consultation with local officials. That work will be transferred to Brighton in the U.K. and Buenos Aires in Argentina. We also plan to transfer some work from Sydney to Japan related to the Japanese card servicing. While 3,500 positions are impacted by the consolidation of locations, the decrease in staff levels is expected to be about 550.  If we move to Slide 4, we'll look at our metrics. Billed business growth continued to be strong, growing 15% or 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. And again, we are outpacing the growth in our major competitors. Billed business for the quarter and the full year are at record levels. Cards-in-force increased 4%, proprietary cards were flat, but GNS cards increased 10% and that averaged to a 4% increase in cards-in-force.  Average Cardmember spending increased, and it continued to be driven by higher Billed business. It reflects our strategy to focus on premium segments, both in Charge Card and the lending products. Loans on a managed basis are down 4%. They were down less than they had been earlier in the year. And in fact, in the quarter, sequentially, loans grew 6% and that is due impart to seasonal spending. And travel sales are up 12%. Move to Slide 5, and this is a chart of monthly Billed business going back to October of '08. The bars are the dollar amount of Billed business per month and the green bars are the fourth quarter amounts for '08, '09 and 2010. The yellow and blue lines are the growth rates both on a reported and FX basis, and you can see the growth rates at the top of the chart. You can see that we've had strong growth throughout 2010 with a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter Billed business in 2010 are well above the '09 and '08 levels. Moving to Slide 6. This is additional information on Billed business, and this is Billed business by growth by segment. And you can see you all segments have double-digit growth both on a reported and FX-adjusted basis. GNS continues to have the strongest growth, but all segments are contributing to the overall strength in Billed business growth. Go to Slide 7. This is Billed business by region, and you can see that all regions, again, have double-digit growth on an FX-adjusted basis. And you can see that each quarter and for each region we've had double-digit growth throughout the year. JPAA (sic) JAPA continues to have the strongest growth, and that's the green dotted line where consumer, commercial card and GNS are all contributing to that strong growth. Next, to Slide 8, and this is spending within USCS by product. And this slide has Billed business or spend by Cardmembers for U.S. consumer and small business over the last five quarters. The growth rate reflects our strategy and our investments that focus on co-brand lending and Charge Card, and those are the two sets of bars on the left side and in the middle of the slide. And also, just note that Charge Card Billed business accounts for 60% of worldwide billings and about 2/3 of proprietary billings. If we move to Slide 9, this is looking at lending Billed business and managed loan growth. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, these metrics no longer are closely correlated. This is a combination of the actions we've taken in terms of credit actions, a reduction in the level of proprietary acquisition and our focus on premium lending, and therefore, a change in the mix where we have more transactions. It's also being impacted by Cardmember behavior as they decide to delever.  If you were to look at the lending trust in December, you would see that payment rates in December of 2010 was 29.63% and that's 2.6 basis points higher than December of '09. So we have more transactions in the portfolio and higher paydown rates, and that has lowered the risk profile of the portfolio. But it also has reduced loan growth and has impacted net interest income. If we go to Slide 10, and this is looking at net interest yield and this is for USCS. And you can see back in '09, we had an increase in the yield as a result of repricing in anticipation of the CARD Act. And if you look at the fourth quarter of '10, you can see the yield is at 9.1% and this is in line with how we expected yields to migrate back to historical levels. If we look at Slide 11, this is our revenue performance. Overall revenues on a managed basis are up 4%. You could see that in the lower right-hand corner. So while this is not robust growth, once again we are having better growth in most of our major competitors. If we look at discount revenue, it's up 12%. This is driven by a 15% growth in Billed business, and it's partially offset by the relatively faster growth in GNS Billed business where we capture a portion of the discount rate, also impacted by higher contra revenues, including higher levels of cash back rewards, and corporate incentive payments. In the quarter, the average discount rate was 2.52%. That's up one basis point from last year, although it's down 4 basis points from last quarter, but that's just the influence of the seasonal spending to a greater degree in retail. And as we've discussed in the past, based on our strategy to drive deeper into everyday spend, it's likely that this will decline over time. Net card fees are down 3%, but it's really the result of an $11 million reserve adjustment that we made last year. Excluding that, it would have been approximately flat in line with flat cards-in-force on a proprietary basis.  Net interest income is down 14% on a managed basis. And while loans were down at the end of the quarter by 1%, average loans were down 4% during the quarter. That, combined with the net interest yield decreasing from 10% in the fourth quarter of '09 down to 9.3% in the fourth quarter of this year, results in managed net interest income being down 14%. Travel commissions is up about 8%. If we look at all other revenues, on a reported basis, it's 8%, but 1% on a managed basis. So the reported numbers benefit from the inclusion of fees related to securitized receivables. So those receivables came on the books in the first quarter and are therefore included in this year's number but not last year's number. In addition, on this slide we see greater foreign currency conversion revenue related to higher spending, higher GNS partner royalties and merchant-related fees, offset by higher levels of investments and partner initiatives and lower TC revenues. So let me go to Slide 12, and this is looking at our provision for losses. So Charge Card credit continues to perform well, although the provision has increased by 30% compared to last year. That's a result of higher accounts receivable based on higher spend. Also the fact that last year, we released reserves as the 30 day past due rate was declining from 2.2% to 1.8%. And this year, we're building reserves slightly as the 30 day past due rate increased from 1% up to 1.6%. This is in line with our strategy to grow profitable share.  The lending provision on a reported basis this year is $37 million. That compares to $560 million on a GAAP basis. But if you had added to that the write-offs for securitized receivables, the managed number would be $1,320,000,000. So this is a significant reduction in provision reflecting the credit metrics that I'll discuss on the following slides. Reserves decreased $672 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but we continue to have strong reserve coverage.  I'll move to Slide 13. This is looking at our expenses. So marketing and promotion increased 14% to $810 million, which is well above our historic level, which generally had run about $650 million per quarter. You don't see a very large percentage increase on this line because we started to ramp up spending on marketing and promotion in the fourth quarter of '09. Cardmember Rewards and Services grew at 13%, in line with the growth in Billed business.  You can see that salaries and benefits increased 31%. If we exclude $113 million of severance costs related to the reengineering that we announced last Wednesday, it increased 22%. This reflects merit increases, higher cost from the reinstatement of certain benefits that were temporarily suspended last year in the recession, such as profit-sharing, higher management incentive compensation, greater volume-related sales incentives as well as a 2% increase in staffing levels, which primarily relate to our growth initiatives and some to higher volumes.  So we are investing against our growth initiatives. These would include higher levels of sales force and client management for Commercial Card and Merchant Services; higher levels in technology, some of which is spent on supporting growth in revenues and some on creating efficiencies; investments in fee service initiatives as well as enterprise growth. So these are all areas that from a strategic aspect are important to us. And I'll discuss the growth in operating expense in a little more detail on the following slides. But first, let me go to Slide 14, which is marketing and promotion expense. So marketing and promotion, each bar is the dollar amount of marketing in each quarter. As we discussed in prior quarters, the higher level of spending is enabled by the credit provision benefit from improving credit performance as well as strong Billed business performance.  As these provision benefits lessen over time, we have the flexibility to move investment spending towards historical levels. Higher spending is really across all segments, so we are spending at higher levels in terms of charge and premium lending acquisition, higher brand media, including spending back in November on Small Business Saturday, higher levels of international consumer acquisition and spend stimulation, perceptions of coverage and higher portfolio development consensus. If we move to Slide 15, so this is a chart we've used for the last several quarters to look at operating expense. Operating expense grew 16%, if you exclude the restructuring. Overhead items such as support functions, including finance and human resources, as well as global services, are growing at a rate less than the average. And as you look at this chart, the different colors are indicative of whether its large. If its large, it's blue, medium is green and yellow is small. The items above 16% in terms of growth rate are really supporting our growth initiatives.  So first, looking at partner investments. So this is an important part of having the right value propositions for our customers and include payments to Delta, Costco and JetBlue. Global Network Services is to support the growth in this segment. For instance in this quarter, Billed business grew 24%, and throughout the year, we've been growing in the mid-20s. The sales force includes sales force for the Merchant business, as well as Commercial Card and is both the sales force and client management, both of these areas have been growing nicely from a Billed business perspective.  On the next page, I'll give you a little bit more detail in terms of new business initiatives and variable tech investments. So I go to Slide 16. Now on the left side, these are examples of the investments that we are making in our new fee revenue area.  So first, we look at LoyaltyEdge. Here we're using our Loyalty platform to generate fee revenues. Next is Revolution Money, which is we've renamed Serve, and here we're building capabilities in the digital space. Next is Business Insights, where we're using data mining capabilities to generate fee revenues while helping merchants to be successful. And for Loyalty Partners and Accertify is the fees that we pay as part of the acquisition. And I think you are all familiar with each of these as we've spoken about them over time.  When we look at variable technology investments, this is some of the items that are driving higher cost. Here, we're either investing to build capabilities to drive revenues or increase efficiency or in some cases, to support regulatory requirements.  So looking at the chart, clearly, investments in Business Insights is designed to drive revenues. We also have a project to consolidate our international A/R platform that would achieve efficiencies. And an example of regulatory implementation would be Basel II that we're investing against. In the digital capabilities, some of those items will drive revenues and some will achieve efficiencies. Moving to Slide 17. So this is a slide that shows expenses excluding provision and excluding the Visa and MasterCard payments. If you look on the right side, the fourth quarter of '07 is above the historical levels because of a charge that we had back then related to Membership Rewards, and these are expenses as a percentage of total managed revenues net of interest expense.  So the main point of this slide is just to point out that we have elevated spending in 2010. It's been enabled by our strong Billed business growth and improving credit, and we've used this opportunity to invest against strategic objectives. These investments are designed to drive revenues in the future. However, we are doing this in a way that enables us to retain the flexibility to scale back on investments as business conditions change or the benefit from credit lessens.  Moving to Slide 18. So this is Charge Card reserve coverage, and this lays out our reserve coverage growth in the U.S. and international. Charge Card credit continues to perform very well, and reserves as a percentage of receivables and reserves as a percentage of 30 days past due remain consistent with prior quarters and strong given the continued favorable performance. Moving to Slide 19. This is a slide that looks at managed lending write-off rate for USCS as well as International Consumer and then on a worldwide basis. So U.S., international and global write-off rates all continue to improve. In the U.S., our write-off rate for the quarter was 4.4%. That improved 310 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year and 80 basis points from the third quarter of this year.  International Consumer now stands at 4%, a 210 basis point improvement from last year and a 30 basis point improvement from last quarter. Our performance continues to outpace the industry reflective of the previous actions that we have taken and the quality of our customer base. Moving to Slide 20. This slide is managed 30 day past due, and this continues to improve as well. In the U.S., it stands at 2.1%, 160 basis points better than the last year in the fourth quarter and 40 basis points improvement from the third quarter. In International, we now stand at 2.3%, 100 basis point improvement from last year and a 50 basis point improvement from last quarter. Now we move to Slide 21. And we look at this slide to understand the write-off rates in this quarter and help our thinking about the write-off rate in the next quarter. So the write-off rate that is contractual relates to the two left-hand charts and early write-offs relate to the right-hand chart. We also need to factor in recoveries.  So looking at the left chart, the write-off rate for the current month are a function of the current to 30 day past due, is the upper left-hand chart, from five months prior, plus the 30 day past due to write-off rate, which is the bottom chart. So the write-off rates in the fourth quarter are a function of the green triangles in the upper left-hand and those are things that went past due from May to June of this year, plus the 30 day past due to write-off rate, which has remained relatively stable.  So if we look to the next quarter, the first quarter of 2011, the next three triangles in the upper left-hand chart are lower than the green triangles. So if the 30 day past due to write-off rate remains stable and if the first quarter of 2011 early write-off and recoveries are similar to the fourth quarter of 2010, the write-off rate in the first quarter of 2011 would be lower than the write-off rate in the fourth quarter of 2010. And as I always say, this is not a forecast. It's just useful information for you to think about the first quarter. As you know from the 8-K that we filed, the write-off rate in December was 4.1%. Now moving to Slide 22. So this is a slide related to reserves. The left-hand chart is for 2009, and these are reserves related to the loans that were on the balance sheet. The right chart is for 2010, and it includes loans that are both securitized and not securitized, which are now on the balance sheet. So in the fourth quarter of 2009, reserves remained relatively flat. In the fourth quarter of 2010, given the improvement in our credit performance, we released $672 million of reserves in the quarter. Moving to Slide 23. So this is lending reserve coverage. So in both the U.S. and worldwide, reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down from the fourth quarter of '09 and the third quarter of 2010. Loans as a percentage of past due in both the U.S. and worldwide, as well as the principal months coverage, has started to come down reflective of our credit performance. In 2010, we reduced reserves by about $500 million in each of the first, second and third quarter. And as I said a moment ago, reduced reserves by $672 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to be cautious in setting reserves given the uncertain economic environment. We think our reserves are reflective of the inherent risks in our portfolio. So next, we move to Slide 24. And here, we see our capital ratios. So our capital ratios are down somewhat from the third quarter as you can see on the chart. Q1 common is down 60 basis points, driven by higher asset levels primarily reflecting the seasonal increase in AR and loans due to higher spending in the fourth quarter.  Another point that I'd make that I think is of interest, so while the final implementation of Basel III rules related to capital ratios will be determined by the Fed, the company estimates that had the new rules been in place during the fourth quarter of 2010, the reported Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios will decline by about 50 basis points. Our Tier 1 common remains among the best in the industry. So next, I move to Slide 25. This is a snapshot of our liquidity. We had excess cash and marketable securities of $20 billion. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities, which is our objective. Next slide has to do with our deposit program. Now this slide provides some new information that we think that you will be interested in. We are now breaking out retail savings accounts between our direct program and our third-party programs. This is a roll forward from the end of 2009 through the end of 2010. And as you can see, we've increased direct deposits from $2.2 billion at the end of '09 to $8.7 billion at 12/31/2010. And it's our intent to continue to increase our direct deposit funding. You can also see on the chart our third-party brokered CDs, their maturities and the rates that we're paying on them, as well as our third-party sweep accounts, which have been at the current level for some time. So with that, let me make a few concluding comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the first nine months of the year. Spending growth remains strong across all of our businesses and segments. In fact, the 2010 fourth quarter and full year Cardmember spending levels are the strongest in our history.  We also saw further improvement in credit trends. Some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions, and some is reflecting the postrecession behavior of customers. The divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels, again, highlights that a key driver of our volume and receivable trends is charge and co-brand spending. The net effect of these factors is a lower risk profile for the company overall.  Revenue growth continue to outpace our large issuer competitors as strong Cardmember spending volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan balances and yields. Importantly, our strong Billed business growth and improving credit trends have once again provided the opportunity to invest in the business at high levels, while also generating strong earnings. These investments are focused on both driving current metrics and building capabilities that would benefit the medium- to long-term success of the company.  While many are reflected in marketing and operating expense, others involved using our strong capital base such as the Accertify and Loyalty Partner acquisitions announced during the quarter. Nevertheless, we recognize that there are headwinds in front of us. So even though there were signs of improving economic conditions, job creation still is relatively weak. Consumer behavior is evolving, and uncertainty continues to exist around the impact of regulatory and legislative initiatives that may impact aspects of our business.  In addition, during 2011, we will stop receiving quarterly Visa and MasterCard litigation payments, and year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in light of the strong 2010 results. Despite these headwinds, we do believe that we can continue to invest at levels that can deliver attractive business growth as we move forward. The flexible nature of many of our investment decisions enable us to adjust those based on the evolving strength of our business.  In addition, our long-standing focus on driving efficiency as evidenced by the restructuring initiatives discussed earlier, reinforces our ability to invest. The bottom line is that our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality results, spending on our network continues to grow well above industry average and our credit performance remains the best among major card issuers. We are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to manage through the changing environment, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening, and we're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Look, I think that when people go through the numbers, the most interesting slide and the most interesting data point is going to be related to expenses and frankly, Slide #17. When we look at those numbers, it suggests that if you look back at 2006, 2007, that might be a normal sort of expense year. As we head into the 2011, where do you think you're going to come out in the context of that 67% or 68% expense ratio on a managed basis? And how quickly can you respond? Is this something that you go into 2011 with a plan and if things are -- particularly, how quickly can you dial back spending?\nDaniel Henry: So there are some aspects of the higher level of spending where we're investing that we believe are going to drive revenue growth going forward. So our investment in a higher level of sales force and client managers related to our Commercial Card business and Merchant business, those are going to continue. But we are confident in our ability to be successful, and those higher level expenses will be covered by revenues that we generate. We also are investing in fee services. So there the nature of the investment we make is different in marketing and promotion, which historically was the primary driver of future revenue growth. But if we're going to grow those businesses like Business Insights, we actually have to incur expenses that run through the operating line. So they're not going to go away. We will monitor our investments in some of these new fee revenues very closely. If they're successful, we'll invest more behind them. If they're not meeting our expectations, we'll dial back. So there are some that are going to continue on an ongoing basis. On the other hand, there are other investments that we're not incurring costs that are fixed, that give us the flexibility that we can dial them down as our benefit from either Visa, MasterCard or from improving credit start to weigh in. So there's really a mix within there. So I can't give you an exact percentage since they are different in nature, but we are watching this very closely. And we believe we have the ability to dial them up or down based on the resources that we have available, while still looking to achieve our financial targets on average and over time.\nOperator: And we have Ken Bruce with BofA Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: I have a question also that relates to the expense side, and I'm sure you're going to get several of these. But recognizing that you've got some flexibility in terms of how you're investing, whether it be in a revenue-generating expense or in fee services, is there anyway that you can size up maybe some of those bubbles so that we can have a better sense as to what the expense levels are that are generally speaking growing above the average and just give us a better sense as to how we can think about modeling your expense base going forward?\nDaniel Henry: So we tried to add a few slides here to provide some additional information, because we knew this would be a focus that you would have since it's a focus that we have. On Slide 15, we tried to give some sense by using the different colors. So certainly, Global Services is a much larger expense base and, say, the additional costs that we're incurring related to regulatory cost, so we try to reflect that. In terms of variable tech SUP [ph], that line is up about $90 million. And on Slide 16, we tried to give you examples of some of the areas where we're spending above historic levels. And it really does go across the gamut from items like Business Insights that's going to drive revenues, to things like consolidating our A/R Platform that will enable us to be efficient from a cost perspective. So we're endeavoring to provide some additional information to give you some insight there. But in terms of exactly how you model where these expenses go, it's partly going to be driven by what's going to happen going forward in terms of the performance of credit. Actually the success we're having with the investments that we're making this year will all kind of calibrate around the level that will eventuate in 2011 and into 2012.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Are you effectively sticking with your guidance in terms of pretax margins in or around 20%?\nDaniel Henry: Yes, I think if you look back over time, historically, that's where we've been. I think expenses as a percentage of revenues will probably run at a slightly higher level over the last four years, the period during which we've been receiving our Visa and MasterCard payments. That's exactly what we said we were going to do. I think we executed against that, but I think 20% is not a precise forecast for the future. But if you think about on average and over time, it would be in that range.\nOperator: And Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: I guess a question on the revenue side of things. Year-over-year, up 4%, which I guess was down a little bit versus the 5% in the third quarter. Obviously, you have the big headwind on the loan shrinkage year-over-year. But just curious as to what do you think really needs to happen given that Billed business is growing sort of in the mid-teen levels? What needs to happen to sort of get you to your long-term target of sort of a high single-digit revenue growth rate?\nDaniel Henry: So I think right now, we have consumers deleveraging. And so during the year, there were sometimes where loans were down from the high single digits, probably earlier in the year even more than that. So that is a headwind. At some point in the future, we'll start to grow. I don't think that it will go back to what it was like in '06 and '07 where loans were growing at the same rate as spending. I would estimate it will grow at a slower pace, but at some point, we'll start to get positive growth there. So that, combined with the levels of Billed business that we're seeing and growth in fee revenues, a combination of all those things, I think, will help get us back to high single digits. Now the other thing is in addition to the loan side impacting us, we're also being impacted this year as yields come down. So at some point, they're going to stabilize. So we have stable yield, some modest growth in loans combined with Billed business and new fee revenues, we think that can put as in a position that we'd like to be in.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: So just to summarize, it sounds like maybe the loan growth and sort of margin headwind that exist today in 2010 should probably ease as we move through 2011?\nDaniel Henry: So I don\u2019t want to do and start forecasting here. I'm just trying to give you some sense about how we think about it kind of on average and over time.\nOperator: And we have Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I guess my question is around the top line growth as well, and I was wondering if you guys provided any update on kind of year-to-date volume trends. And then, maybe just thinking about what near-term volume trends could be given the comps kind of get tougher the first half of this year. How should we think about it first half of this year and into the latter part of the year?\nDaniel Henry: So as you know, I will do a forecast here. I will say that Billed business volumes for the first portion of January are comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter. I think as you think about where our volumes will go going forward, we've often talked about the fact that Billed business correlates pretty closely to GDP. So we for our planning purposes, always look at the blue chip consensus to give us a grounding in terms of how we think about the balance of the year. And then as that changes during the year, we calibrate up or down depending on what we're seeing in the economy. So in reality, the way we think about it and a good way for you to think about it would be to look at forecast of GDP or your own opinion about that is a good way to think about where our Billed business growth will go as we go forward.\nOperator: Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: I guess I just had a couple of questions. One was on the expense side and one is on the capital side. On the expense side, you indicated that you're expecting to keep on investing and hit your pretax margin goals. I'm just wondering, as reserve fleet goes away and as the Visa, MasterCard payments go away, do you expect a quick transition of the expense ratio or more moderate?\nDaniel Henry: Yes, we've always been very mindful that Visa and MasterCard will end at some point, which will be later in 2011. And we have used the opportunity from both Visa and MasterCard, as well as our improving performance in Billed business and credit, to take this opportunity to invest at high levels. If we're successful at that, that will generate revenues into the future, and that was always our strategy as we go forward. Will the mix of expenses shift a little bit to the extent fee business has become a bigger part of the total? That would happen because that's not driven by marketing promotion. We just have to see how that evolves over time. But we've been very mindful that at some point, the benefits that are correlated to credit will lessen. And that 2011 is the last year that we have the Visa and MasterCard payments.\nOperator: Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nDaniel Henry: So maybe you want to go back at some point to hear the question about capitals.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I had two questions. One, just to drill down a little further on expense, and I'm sure you guys are getting a little tired of it. But on the other expense line, two quarters ago, we saw that ramp up dramatically and that's where the contract expense from Visa MasterCard rolls on. So how should we expect to see that trend through this year as that begins to roll off in the back half of 2011? Will the expense -- just looking for a clear answer, will you be looking to get that expense to ratchet down in a way to compensate for that payment rolling down to, I believe, it's $77 million per quarter? And secondly, has the discussions you're having with retailers changed at all since the guidance given by the Fed on debit interchange in December?\nDaniel Henry: Just in terms of expenses, as I said before, there are certain expenses that have increased during the year that will continue at higher levels. Examples of that would be our investments against enterprise growth, adding sales force, hiring employees to drive other fee revenues. Others, we've kept variable in nature. And instead of hiring employees, we've used certain outside professional groups to help us do that. That gives us the ability to have flexibility and variability so that we can take that down as appropriate. So could I just ask you the latter part of your question, if you could articulate that again as it relates to merchants?\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Sure. I was looking to understand if your discussion with merchants regarding American Express offering your cards to pricing has changed, the tone of it, has changed at all since the December 16th guidance or 14th guidance offered by the Fed on debit interchange pricing?\nDaniel Henry: I think we're in constant discussion with merchants. We are always having discussions about the value that we can bring them, how we can help them to be successful. And they are always looking to see that they pay the appropriate price for the service that we provide. So I don't think the discussions with the merchants have changed notably over the last several months at this juncture.\nOperator: We are now going to go back to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Just on the capital side, I know you can't talk about what you're asking for [indiscernible] for the capital plan, but maybe you could give us some sense as to what kind of capital ratios you would like to hold going forward and when you think you might begin a buyback program?\nDaniel Henry: So many folks who have submitted to the Fed are looking to increase their dividend. I think as all of you know, we did not cut our dividend. But in our filing, we're starting from a position of strength from a Tier 1 common perspective. And in our submission, we requested that we could restart our share repurchase program. It's my understanding that they've committed to get back to companies by the end of March. And once we hear from them, if we get approval, then we would restart the share repurchase program. The guidance that we gave last summer when we were talking about where we said ROE, is that we would look on average and over time to return to shareholders about 50% of earnings through dividends and share repurchases and use about 50% to support the growth in our balance sheet and for bolt-on acquisitions.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: And is that something you think you could get to in the first quarter, or is that something you would get to over time?\nDaniel Henry: Well, I think they should really get back to companies at least 10 days before the end of March. I think we'd be in our blackout period by then. So if that's the time when they get back to us, I would assume we would start the repurchase program in the second quarter.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: I guess what I'm saying is the first quarter in which you were able to restart your program, you would start with 50% payout ratio. You don't think you'd need to work out towards that?\nDaniel Henry: I think our target is kind of an annual amount that we'd be targeting. So I would kind of be mindful of what our earnings were for the year and over the course of the year, look to get up to the 50% level.\nOperator: And now go to Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: A question on growth. You did seem to have an acceleration in growth in cards-in-force both U.S. and internationally in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if there are specific programs or if there is momentum on the addition of new cardholders, if you're seeing better response rates, or what is driving that? Is there something unusual or is it just an acceleration of the success of the investments you've been making?\nDaniel Henry: As you know, we are investing at elevated levels in terms of marketing and promotion we have throughout this year. I think the improved position from a cards-in-force perspective is a result of the success of that acquisition. I think we're seeing the success of that in our Billed business numbers as well. We are focused on the premium segment, and to acquire premium Cardmembers are more expensive. So I don't think you'll see us move to high single-digit growth in cards-in-force. It's really about the quality of the customers that we're focusing on. And I think you're seeing that in our average spend, which is a major driver of Billed business. So I think it is the investments that's helping to improve cards-in-force and to drive spending on our network. So now also, we were kind of flat on the proprietary side. We continue to have good acquisition of cards by our GNS partners, which is up about 10%. And the two of those together averaged the 4% growth in cards-in-force that we saw.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: That's for the full year though, right?\nDaniel Henry: It's year-over-year.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Right, and I was saying the acceleration I saw -- I mean, what I was talking about was specifically the fourth quarter. But has the net interest margin bottomed at this point? Did I hear you had approximately the decline in margins? And it's my last question, but I want to make sure I'm clear on that.\nDaniel Henry: So I didn't say it bottomed. I said it was migrating in accordance with the way we expected. If you go back in history, you would see that our margins at some points were kind of in the high eights, 8.8%, 8.9%. So part of it is still some additional migration to take place. But that's going to be impacted by the mix of our customers, and the mix of our receivables or loans has changed a little bit. We have a lot more transactors in the portfolio, so that could come into play as well. But it's pretty much on line with what our expectations are.\nOperator: Brad Ball with Evercore.\nBradley Ball - Evercore Partners Inc.: Dan, a couple of follow-up, quick ones. In terms of the capital, are you still thinking that a 10% Tier 1 common would be sort of the appropriate low mark for you now that you've got a sense for what Basel III looks like and you'd be coming in with a 10.6% number pro forma here for the fourth quarter. And then separately, with respect to the Fed's proposals for debit interchange cuts in Durbin, if those were to go through those 80%-plus cuts in debit interchange, what would be the implications for credit card interchange and for Charge Card interchange in your view? Would competitive forces drive Charge Card and credit card interchange down?\nDaniel Henry: So on the capital side, I think when we put out our ROE target, we just had to make an assumption about capital levels. So we picked 10%. That wasn't a forecast for the future about where our minimum levels will be. I think as you know, to date the Fed hasn't even issued rules yet. But based on Basel, you would expect the minimum to be 7%, so 4.5% plus the buffer of 2.5%. Will this going to evolve over time? We're going to get a better sense over time about how they think about the countercyclical aspects as things will deteriorate. You may get a sense of what they look for from systemically large institutions. We know we're not part of the 19 global, but we are part of the 19 in the U.S. that they look at. So that will have some implication. So I don't want to pick a set number other than to say I think we would always want to have a capital position that gave us flexibility. And over time, we need to figure out exactly where that is. We feel relatively comfortable where we are today and even after the new Basel rules come into place. So we'll play that by ear as we go forward. As it relates to interchange, if anything, I would say the focus on credit interchange is probably less today than it was six or 12 months ago. So we don't see that imminently being on the horizon, although you never know what may take place. In terms of -- that's from a legislative point of view. From a marketplace point of view, I think we need to actually wait and see what the final rules are. And if they stay where they are, what would be the reaction of merchants? Will merchants look to shift, steer to debit or not? Some may decide to do it. They may decide not to do it, and I think we'll have to wait and see how that plays out in the marketplace. As we've discussed before, and many others have, there's a lot of complication in steering in terms of just the education within the firm that was going to do that, what the sharing of the benefit would be between consumers and the merchants. And then very importantly, what would be the reaction of customers to that. Would they be benign about it, or would they result in some consumers deciding to take their business elsewhere. All those things, which are a lot of things, need to play in the marketplace before we have clearer view about that.\nOperator: Bill Carcache with Macquarie.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Dan, you've talked about your interest in prepaid in the past, but can you give us an update on when we can expect to hear more on what your plans are in the prepaid space? And then also, you mentioned earlier that the discount rate should come down over time as you try to capture greater percentage of every day spend. I believe that's what you'd said. Can you just give us a sense of what rate of, I guess, kind of compression that we can see in the discount rate we can expect to see in the discount rate and kind of over what period of time relative to what we've seen in the past?\nDaniel Henry: So in the prepaid side, we've had very good growth in prepaid, although prepaid is a relatively small component of our total business. So we haven't broken that out. We think we have good capabilities and good products. In addition to that, Dan Schulman, who joined us recently, has a significant amount of experience in prepaid. So that will be a focus of ours going forward. At the moment, we don't have a plan to make any additional disclosures around that, but it is a space that we have done reasonably well over time. This past season we think was a good season, holiday season for gift cards across the industry and we participated in that. So we'll need to watch how the market place evolves, and we think we can play a significant role in that marketplace. In terms of discount rate, I think we've historically said that you could see a decline of two or three basis points per year over time as we pushed into everyday spend. And obviously, it depends on what rate we push in. Now you also know that over the past, really, two or three years, we haven't seen that rate of decline. As, when it's appropriate, we've talked to certain merchant categories about the value we bring and have agreed on higher pricing. So it's only been about, I guess, one basis point or so that we've seen. So that's kind of the way to think about it I think, and we'll see how the actual additional push into everyday spend goes and where there are pricing opportunities in the future, when it's appropriate from a value perspective and in certain categories.\nOperator: Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just one on the DOJ case and steering, do you currently allow for steering on the debit cards, or is that also part of their contention?\nDaniel Henry: I think Durbin dealt with the ability to steer. So before legislation, people could steer to cash by offering a discount. Durbin allows steering from credit to debit. The DOJ had to do with steering from credit-to-credit.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just a separate question, the airline industry seems like a place where you might see discounting take place because this is such a big part of their fee structure. But you've had a fairly close relationship with several airlines over the past. Can you just give us any color a, on the airlines and the relationship you had with them and their fees and the pressure on those fees? And maybe also internationally where you do see some airlines either discount or surcharge for credit cards, what's been your experience there if you could share any of that color.\nDaniel Henry: So our relationship with airlines has been long and important. They are very important merchant for us. I think we are a very important enabler for them in their business. So we have discussions with them on an ongoing basis each year and probably every quarter, and we'll continue to do that. We certainly talk to them about the value of the customers we bring. We have a strong Corporate Card business. We have a very affluent Consumer business. We have a strong position within small business. So all of those customers are not only our premier customers but their premium customers, and we work to really the mutual benefit of not only ourselves but then and our customers. So we look to strengthen the benefits that we give to our Cardmembers that are high spenders, many of those high spenders are frequent flyers. So for instance, recently we've ensured that we have lounge access with US Air. We have a program to waive baggage fees. We don't waive them, but we reimburse them to the extent that they incur them. So this is a very important merchant category for us that we are very focused on as I said. And the airlines are very focused on because it's important to them as well.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Internationally?\nDaniel Henry: Internationally, I think we've seen pockets on smaller airlines where they have had a differentiated charge depending on what your payment method is. It's not widespread though. It's generally been on some of the non-major airlines.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then they're also impacting your business basically?\nDaniel Henry: I think anytime you lose $1 of revenue, it's an impact on your business, but it has not been significant.\nOperator: Brian Foran with Nomura.\nBrian Foran - Goldman Sachs: On Slide 26, when we calculate out the deposit repricing opportunity, should we assume that all falls to lower interest expense and benefits the NIM, or is some of that going to be offset by ABS funding or something like that rolling off?\nDaniel Henry: So this is just one of the many pieces of our funding. And we want to keep a balance between our deposit program, unsecured and securitization because loans have not been growing. There haven't been a need for issuances of large amounts in either unsecured or the securitization area. But we'll continue to fund using all three sources even though they have somewhat different pricing. We want to have the right price, but we also want to have diversity, and we also want to have the right duration in our funding sources. So certainly, deposits is a good funding source for us. Although on average and over time, the cost of funds and deposits is about the same as that you would find in the unsecured and secured space. When rates are low, deposits are a little more expensive. When rates are high, deposits are a little less expensive. But our main focus is to have the right mix and diversity of funding over time.\nBrian Foran - Goldman Sachs: And then putting together all your expense comments, I mean, my interpretation was operating leverage remains negative in '11 but maybe flips to positive in 2012. Is that what you were trying to say or is that me interpreting too much what you're saying?\nDaniel Henry: So I wasn't attempting to forecast at all for 2012. I was trying to be helpful in terms about how you think about next year. I suspect that in next year, we continue to have Visa and MasterCard benefits. And so we'll spend at higher levels. We'll likely have credit benefits as well, not at the same level we have this year. So all those things enable us to continue to spend, to help drive our business. As I said before, we also have to look and see how our fee services initiatives play out. And you could see some mix change in expenses between historical amount and the mix between marketing and promotion and operating expense. But that will play out over some period of time.\nBrian Foran - Goldman Sachs: Maybe I can ask a better way is what's the typical lead time between an investment in the fee services business translating to accelerating revenue growth in the fee services businesses?\nDaniel Henry: So I think all investments we have even if it's an acquisition of Cardmembers, generally, in the first year, we have a loss because of the acquisition cost. It breaks even, starts to turn profitable kind of in the second year. When you look at sales force, you need to bring people in. You need to train them. There's an experience building process. So again, that takes probably 18 months or more to get a good payback. When you're building a new business, there's a requirement for investment before you actually start to get momentum. So I think all these investments take a little while before they actually start to payback regardless to which category it is.\nOperator: David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: A question about cards, if you could just clarify again. If you want to make the adjustments for the partner cards in prior quarters before the third quarter were to be about 1 million or 1.6 million for last year and...\nDaniel Henry: It was 1.6 million cards.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: In Q3. Would that be the right number for the prior quarters as well?\nDaniel Henry: I think so.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then just on the Professional Services expense, could you talk about how much of that contracts were, I guess, technology and how much is just kind of discretionary? You've kind of alluded a little bit to that, but could you clarify how much of that could be variable?\nDaniel Henry: Yes, so that's across a broad spectrum of areas. Part of it is technology, part of it is moving forward some of our fee service investments. The good part about that line is it would tend to be more variable than other lines. And in part, we utilize that line for that very reason. So we had the ability to moderate it when appropriate. So I think there's a fair amount of flexibility in the line. There's some base in there that it's not, but I think the increase that you've seen is largely variable in nature.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: And then just on card growth again in the U.S. If you look at the growth in marketing spending, it looks like marketing spending in USCS and limited card growth recently. Can you just talk about how longer term you drive Billed business growth without card growth or without account growth?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So I mean, I think if you think of the old model, where we were spending against charge, co-brand and a broad spectrum of proprietary lending, it costs significantly less to bring in a card that's going to spend $1,000 or $1,500 a year, it costs significantly more to bring in a card that is anywhere near our average spend per Cardmember. So our focus is really on the premium end. And so I don't think we'll return to high single-digit growth in cards-in-force. But to the extent -- and in every quarter, we have some attrition as we always have. So I think the key for us is bringing in the right customers that are in line with our strategy, that will enable us to improve the risk profile of our balance sheet. And at the same time, enable us to grow our Billed business at a rate that enables us to achieve our long-term financial targets.\nOperator: And we have Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: Dan, are all the loans now tied to prime? I know on my monthly statement I just got a big disclosure attached to my statement talking about how my loan is tied to prime. And so is that complete now for all U.S. cards and international? And then do you have a managed revenue growth number for the quarter, and do you think that you'll sort of meet your 8% managed revenue growth number in '11?\nDaniel Henry: So the vast majority of our cards in the U.S. are all variably priced. In international, I think the majority are variably priced, but not to the same degree that would be true in the U.S. But if you look at our total loans of $51 billion, the vast majority are variably priced at the end of the day. In terms of managed revenue growth, that's at about 4%. I think we're benefiting from the Billed business side, but certainly the loan side, a combination of the yield and the actual loan balances have a very dampening effect. Although we do think over time, we can get revenues back up into the high single digits. And by doing that, we think we can achieve our financial targets over time.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: They're trying to figure out what the tax rate noise was. I think I discovered on Page 20 that the tax rate was just 5.6% in the International Card Services. Can you comment on that a little bit? And then just in the International, it seems like the discount revenues were somewhere between 18% and 20% of total. But then only 7% of the pretax dropped to the pretax line and then you didn't really have to pay taxes in that segment. Any specific issues in that International segment for the quarter?\nDaniel Henry: So I don't think there's any specific issues. I think our international tax rate has always been very low, and it really has to do with how we do our internal allocations that really drives that lower tax rate. But our all-in tax rate within the company was really driven by some of the permit [ph] differences we have and the tax strategies that we have in place, which have been in place for a number of years. So there's nothing unique in this quarter related to taxes.  So I'll take one last question.\nOperator: That will be coming from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Dan, I was wondering if you could provide us an update and thoughts on acquisitions? And also, as you look at alternative payments, have you made the investments that you need to make to sort of position American Express, or do you feel like there's still room for some decent moderate-sized acquisitions?\nDaniel Henry: So I think acquisitions are going to be part of our business model going forward. I think we're generally going to focus on bolt-on acquisitions that support our strategy. I think the acquisitions that we've made so far ranging from Revolution Money and now Serve that will enable our digital strategy. I think it certifies a very good example where we can make an acquisition and leverage it to the benefit of both merchants and ourself. I think Loyalty Partners is the same thing. We're going to leverage our loyalty knowledge, our relationship with merchants, our global reach to take Loyalty Partners to a level that would have been difficult for them to do without the acquisition. And I think we'll continue to look and see what other acquisitions of that type we can do going forward. I would say that we've made great strides in terms of our capabilities in the digital space, although I think we will continue to look to build onto those capabilities to make the Serve platform even stronger and have greater utility in the marketplace as we go forward. So we want to use marketing promotions, we want to use operating expense to help grow the business organically. But we want to use the strong capital generation capabilities that the firm has and our strong capital position to also help further the strategies that we've been articulated to you.  Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and have a very pleasant evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 7:00 today until January 31 at midnight.

Welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall. Please go ahead, sir.\nRon Stovall: Okay, thank you very much, Kathy and welcome. We appreciate all of you for joining us today on the call. As usual it's my job to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intent, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2009 10-K report, and 2010 first and second quarter 10-Q reports, all already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the third quarter 2010 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will be structured differently than recent calls. We will begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Chenault, who will provide some perspective on the evolving regulatory environment surrounding the payments industry and the DOJ's anti-trust lawsuit against the company. Then Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings document and provide some summary or a brief summary remarks. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get in to the queue for the Q&A period where both Ken and Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible, before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.\nDaniel Henry: Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining our call today. As Ron said, given the news that hit this month about the DOJ lawsuit, we're going to break from our norm on today's conference call. So before turning things over to Dan to cover the third quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes sharing my views on the various regulatory and legislative changes that have occurred over the last two years, including the DOJ lawsuit. I'm going to discuss the issues raised by all of these changes, not just for our company but for the payments industry overall. First, I want to assure you that we're taking the DOJ lawsuit very seriously. However, a number of the changes we're currently seeing are likely to have far greater impact on industry growth, pricing, consumer behavior and merchant relationships than the DOJ suit alone. The lawsuit after all is about steering between credit products. Merchants are already allowed to offer a discount or incentive for customers who pay by cash, check, or debit card, but few do. For bank issued credit products, there is some rate differential between products. For example, for Visa credit products, the difference between their high and low interchange rates is approximately 90 basis points. That's $0.90 on a $100 purchase. All things being equal, it seems questionable whether merchants would disrupt the transaction at the point-of-sale and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill for the sake of a relatively small differential. For me, the core issue of the lawsuit is a simple one. It's about consumer choice and the right of a customer to select the card they want to use at the point-of-sale. Now I don't believe the government or the merchant should be making this choice. This choice should belong to the customer. And I also believe that we, as a company, like American Express, should have the right to negotiate freely with our merchants on the terms of our contract. Our contract requires the welcome acceptance of our card products and our customers at the point-of-sale. And I don't believe that government intervention in this manner, or in any legal commercial negotiation, will lead to a positive outcome. Finally, I disagree strongly with the DOJ's assertion that we have market power, that merchants are forced to accept our products. This is not the case, and I believe it's one of the many reasons why we'll win this suit. In terms of merchant acceptance, we\u2019re the smallest network, smaller even than Discover who is not a party to this suit. In the DOJ's own anti-trust case against Visa and MasterCard several years ago, they explicitly stated, and the courts agreed, that we did not have market power. Merchants chose to accept Amex because they understand the value we bring them. Higher spending customers, our superior service and our marketing expertise to help them expand their business. Our actions in the marketplace are all about competition, not coercion. Now, as I said earlier, while we certainly take this lawsuit seriously, it's also essential to put into perspective, and in fact, connect the dots against all the changes across the payments and card industry in recent years. Just over the last two years, we've seen the CARD Act, the Dodd-Frank bill, we've seen Durbin on interchange regarding debit and new regulatory limits on over limit fees. Now this regulation and the legislation has clearly been the most significant in the history of the card industry. Each clearly reflects the political environment and have turned back towards regulation rather than competition in the banking, financial services and card industry. And while they share a common starting point, each one is likely to have a different impact on the market, on the consumer and on different players in the industry. For example, among other impacts, the CARD Act has changed how some consumer products are priced. On one side, it has simplified terms, conditions and made disclosure more transparent. It has insulated some consumers from higher interest rates and fees if they fall behind on payments. And it forced some issuers to stop practices that were misleading or at best, very hard for customers to understand. Now on the other side, it may cause some lenders to limit access to credit to all but the most financially secured borrowers. It may increase the overall cost of borrowing from some banks as they offset their inability to charge higher rates for riskier customers. It's made the traditional, mass market credit card business less attractive. It's caused some issuers to reorient their sites on the premium sector. And it may cause others to scale back investments in the card business perhaps significantly. Now we've noted before that because of our spend base model, we are less impacted by the CARD Act than our bank issuing peers. For example, while we did have a significant impact within our yield because of the Act, we've worked to mitigate it through our repricing activities over recent quarters. The financial impact on many issuing banks from the CARD Act is substantially greater and therefore harder to mitigate. And during the second quarter earnings cycle, a number of our issuing peers disclosed that after mitigation, they would have net income losses of several hundred million dollars as a result of the CARD Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, which included Durbin and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, coupled with the Reg E changes to overdraft practices, are likely to have an equally broad impact on issuing banks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will represent continued uncertainty until its approach and regulatory program are clarified. And the combined effects of Durbin and Reg E are easier to see. So on the one side, it's eliminated high, frequent, overdraft charges to consumers, Reg E. It's eliminated the practice of processing high ticket debit transactions, out of sequence, in order to generate multiple overdraft fees. It may provide merchants a lower interchange and/or transaction fee for debit in certain prepaid cards. And it has given consumers the choice of whether to accept and pay for overdraft protection. On the other side, it's made the debit card business much less attractive to banks. If banks do end up imposing monthly debit or transaction fees, consumers may shift back to creditor charge products. And it may lead some banks to impose higher fees or rates elsewhere in retail banking to compensate for lost debit revenue. But there are certainly competitive consequences to an action like that. And it has the potential to cause a scale back or elimination of rewards programs that are tied to debit products. So what we have here is bank issuers are seeing their debit economics squeezed from two sides. Low interchange rates and lower revenues from overdraft fees. Their previous public disclosures on these changes, again, projected loss revenue in the billions of dollars. Our charge and credit products do compete with debit, so the Durbin pricing adjustments will impact competition among payment products. However, whether and to what extent that competition will affect our pricing and revenues will depend on these specific government guidelines and the reaction of consumers to steering. Depending on the Fed's reasonable and proportional debit study comes out, there is the potential for a 50 to 100 basis points reduction in debit interchange fees from current levels. And this could increase the gap between debit and credit rates to approximately 150 to 200 basis points. With this potential benefit, some merchants may try to steer their customers towards debit, but given this rate differential, it's possible they could fund some discount or incentive to encourage customers to switch to debit. But there is still a question of whether the amount will be significant enough for merchants to disrupt the sales process and risk a potential loss of customer goodwill. Now the DOJ case on the surface addresses some of the same issues as Durbin. The terms of its settlement deal with Visa and MasterCard would allow merchants to steer consumers to a lower-price credit or debit product. For example, if a consumer pulls out a Visa rewards product, the merchant has the right to ask a customer to switch to a Visa MasterCard credit product with a lower rate. The merchant could offer the consumer an incentive for them to switch or they could just ask. Now as I mentioned earlier, the gap between a higher cost of Visa and a lower cost Visa is about 90 basis points. And for context, the Amex average rate is about 25 basis points higher than Visa and MasterCard's average for credit products or about $0.25 on a $100 transaction. Assuming these differentials remain constant, steering between credit products does not offer a lot of marginal economics for merchants. Particularly when weighed against the potential alienation of good customers and the operational difficulties in implementing these actions at the point of sale. The irony here is that if the DOJ's case against us were successful, and merchants did engage in steering, it is far more likely for merchants to steer customers to Visa and MasterCard and away from us, thereby making the two dominant players in the industry even more dominant and harming competition. This is why we must defend and win this case, and we will. So in my view, as far as the DOJ settlement is concerned, it offers a remedy that could push more business to the two largest networks. And if it is put into effect, could push consumers to lower value cards that offer minimal protections, fewer benefits, limited customer service, scaled-back rewards and potentially higher interest rates. So for the card industry, over the last two years, the impact of the legislative, regulatory and DOJ actions can be summarized like this. The CARD Act will have the biggest impact on issuers who have relied heavily on interest income from basic revolving credit products, issuers who relied heavily on back end and penalty fees and issuers that targeted less creditworthy borrowers. Durbin will have the biggest impact on debit card issuers and potentially on merchants steering to debit from other payment products. Now the DOJ impact is yet to be determined, but it is more likely to have a smaller dollar impact on the industry than the CARD Act or Durbin. Now going forward, I believe the traditional, lend centric models most bank issuers rely on will need to be refashioned. Some issuers will focus on low-cost, no-frills products, others will focus on full-service, high-value alternatives and this segmentation among issuers is already underway. Going forward, I believe debit based models will look much different and debit products will likely cost more for consumers to use while offering fewer rewards. But I also believe that despite all the changes, there are some constants. First, that many consumers and merchants will continue to place a premium on superior value and service and second, that regardless of the industry, merchants, while they will always want to lower price, want high spending customers and value from the payment networks they choose to accept. Merchants know how important it is to treat customers well at the checkout counter, particularly in a slow growth economy. And successful merchants will be reluctant to risk losing the goodwill of their customers, absent a real economic upside for them. So while everyone will need to adapt to a new regulatory environment, long-term success within payments will continue to depend on several factors: treating customers well; providing superior service; providing value in return for a fair price. Innovation is going to be critical, and obviously, keeping expenses in line. Superior service and value will continue to earn a premium price from card members and merchants and I believe that we can compete very successfully as a network of choice for high spending Cardmembers. Our strong recent performance has shown that we have been successful in each of these areas. And I remain highly confident in our ability to compete and win in the future. So with that, let me now turn things over to Dan to go into detail on our third quarter results.\nDaniel Henry: Okay, thanks, Ken. So I will use our slide package and start with Slide 2, summary of financial performance. So total revenues were up 17%, but the more appropriate line to look at is the managed total revenue line, which was up 5%. That compares with being down 1% in the second quarter. Income is $1,093,000,000, that is the second quarter in a row that we've had income over $1 billion. EPS is at $0.90, a significant improvement from last year. And ROE is now 26%. Moving to Slide 3, metric performance, Billed business had 14% growth and this is a continuation of the strong growth that we saw in both the first and second quarter. Cards-in-force, proprietary cards were flat with last year. GNS cards increased 3% so total cards are up 1%. Average spending also has continued to be strong with growth of 15%. Loans on a managed basis decreased 6% based on our actions and customer deleveraging. Now this is down less than what we saw in the first and second quarter. Travel sales increased 21%, driven by Airline spending, which is up 20% as we saw both higher average price and higher number of transactions, both in consumer and corporate. Looking at Slide 4, Worldwide Billed business, so the bars on this chart reflect the amount of Billed business each month. The lines represent the growth rate both on a reported and an FX basis. So monthly Billed business has been at $58 billion or more since March. The third quarter, we had growth of 14% despite more difficult grow overs as billings were improving last year. Now Billings month to date in October are growing at about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 5, which is Billed business by segment, you can see that we had strong Billed business growth across all businesses. Each segment had double-digit growth both on a reported and an FX adjusted basis. GNS continues to have the strongest growth, but Global Commercial Services or GCS, continues to grow at above average rates. Again this quarter, it appears that we will gain share in the U.S. as growth in our spending by our customers is notably above the growth we see in our competitors' spending. Slide 6, Billed business growth by region. So here again, we see strong performance in all regions, particularly, JPAA, which is Asia and Australia. All regions had double-digit growth on an FX adjusted basis so we can see that the growth in business is really very broad-based both by business and by geography. Moving to Slide 7, so this is spending by product for U.S. consumer and small business. And you can see here, spending by product over the past five quarters. Billed business growth continues to be strongest in charge and co-brand products, consistent with our strategy in investments in premium lending and charge. Moving to Slide 8, so this is Lending, Billed business and managed loan growth. The solid line is Billed business and the dotted line is loans on a managed basis. So loan balances are no longer tracking closely with the increase in spending on lending products as you can see on the chart. Due in part to our actions and part to consumer deleveraging, our actions have included line management reductions, fewer prop lending acquisitions and significant reductions in balance transfer. And Cardmembers have changed their behavior as they are transacting more and revolving less. If you look at our lending trust pay-down rates, in September of '09, pay-down was 25.2% and in September of 2010, it was 29.28%, an increase of over 400 basis points. So next is Slide 9, this is our net interest yields for USCS, we can get managed loans. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact of the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing. And you can see on the chart, the increase in yields from the fourth quarter of '08 to the first quarter of '09. We expect yield to migrate back to the historical range of yields in the high 8% or 9% and you can see that this is taking place in the second and third quarter of this year. Moving to Slide 10, which is revenue performance, discount revenue is up 13% driven by 14% growth in Billed business, partially offset by faster growth in GNS Billed business and higher contra-revenues, including higher cash back rewards and corporate incentive payments. The average discount rate was 2.56%, up two basis points from last year and flat with the second quarter. The increase compared to last year reflects certain pricing initiatives. Going forward, we will likely see an erosion in the average discount rate over time. Card fees continued to hold and were basically flat with last year. Net interest income should be looked at on a managed basis, so we're down 16%, this is a combination of loans being down 6% and a decrease in yield from 10.2% last year to 9.5% in the third quarter of this year. So those are worldwide numbers, the numbers on the prior slide for USCS. Travel commissions and fees reflect the higher travel sales that we saw earlier. Other revenues, up 13% on a reported basis and that reflects the fact that we have fees on loans that were previously securitized. If you look at it on a managed basis, we're up 4% and that's being driven by higher foreign currency conversion revenue and higher GNS partner-related revenues. Overall, we're up 5%. And while that's not robust, it compares very favorably to the revenue growth that we saw earlier in the year. Now moving to Slide 11, Charge Card provision improved over $50 million based on improved metrics and lower reserve requirements. If we look at Cardmember loans or lending provision, it has improved dramatically by over $700 million on a GAAP basis, as you can see on the slide. On a managed basis, it's actually $1.2 billion better. And this is due to significantly improved write-off rates, which will result in lower write-off dollars in the quarter and improved 30-day past due levels that translate into lower reserve requirements. Reserves decreased by $548 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Slide 12, expense performance, marketing promotion is up significantly in the third quarter compared to last year and up from $208 million in the second quarter of this year. This is consistent with what we have said, as credit improved we indicated we would drop some to the bottom line and invest to drive business momentum. Next is rewards. Now here, if we exclude the benefit in the third quarter of '09 related to a policy change, related to accounts that were 30-day past due, rewards expense increased in line with spending. Salaries and benefit increased 7%. This reflects merit increases, higher benefit costs and higher incentive compensation. On an employee base, it's basically flat with last year. Other operating expense includes, in last year, a benefit related to an adjustment to how we accounted for our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. Absent that, it increased 17%, reflecting higher technology related expense, higher T&E and investments in new business initiatives. Now income taxes are higher and that is due in part to higher income and part to the fact that we have a higher tax rate. In this quarter it's 33%, in the third quarter of last year, it was 30%. And that really reflects the level of pretax income relative to the recurring permanent differences that we have. So when income is lower, those permanent differences have a larger impact and as income increases, has less of an impact. So a 33% rate is a reasonably normalized rate for our business. Moving to Slide 13, marketing and promotion expense. As I've mentioned, marketing and promotion is above historic levels as you can see on this chart. We have elevated spending levels across U.S. Consumers and Small Business, International Consumer and the Merchant and Network businesses. Within USCS, it's primarily charged and premium co-brand acquisition. In International Consumer it's primarily acquisition and spend stimulation. In the merchant business, it's spending on perceptions of coverage and brand communication. And in GNS, it's contractual payments driven by higher Billings. Moving to Slide 14, operating expense. So operating expense growth was 12%. Now some portion of that is investments to drive growth of our business, and that is above 12%. And a portion is not driving revenues, and that's below the 12%. Here we can see that we have significantly higher levels of spending on technology development that supports business growth. New business initiatives including LoyaltyEdge, Revolution Money and Business Insights, as well as GNS partner investments and higher levels of sales force. While below the dotted line, we are controlling non-revenue-generating OpEx. Moving to Slide 14, now this is Charge Card reserve coverage. Now while Charge Card credit metrics are improving, we haven't maintained appropriate levels of reserves across the U.S. card, international card and Global Commercial Services as you can see from the reserve coverage ratios on this page. Now on Slide 16, here you're looking at managed lending net write-off rates. And here you can see that managed lending write-off rates have improved dramatically over the last four quarters in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., in the third quarter, the write-off rate was 5.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the second quarter and 370 basis points improvement compared to last year. Our metric performance is substantially better than the industry. Next, Slide 17. So this is the managed lending 30-day past due chart. So again, lending 30-day past due also continues to improve both in the U.S. and internationally. These improvements will prove to be beneficial to us as we move forward. Next is Slide 18. Now here we're providing information for USCS lending related to roll rates and bankruptcy filings. So the current month write-off is a function of the current to 30-day past due roll rate five months ago. So the green triangles in the upper left chart lead to the write-off rate in the third quarter of this year. And you can see that they are lower in the three triangles just before that. So all else being equal, you would expect write-offs in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter, which is what we've seen. You'll also see that the three triangles following the three dots are lower. So all else being equal, we could see fourth quarter write-offs being lower than the third quarter. You'll also note the 30-day past due to write-off, the bottom left chart, is improving slightly. Now bankruptcies on the right, if you took on average of the three quarters in 2010, you can see that they're slightly lower than what we saw in 2009, and this is the number of filings. Two other things to consider is the dollar amount of each filing. And they have been lower this year than in 2009. And the other is the percentage of filings that we've already written off, and that percentage is higher than we saw last year. So all in all, bankruptcy losses are lower than last year. Now I\u2019d remind you that these are uncertain economic times and what the write off rate in the fourth quarter will be will depend on the 30-day past due to write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries, what they actually are. Moving to Slide 19, so this is our lending reserve levels, and it reflects the activity in the third quarter of last year and this year, and you can see that the dollar write-offs has improved significantly. So if you look at the chart and look at '09, write-offs were $850 million. This year, they were $810 million, but that includes both the previously securitized and those that were on balance sheet. If we look at this on an apples-to-apples basis, you'd have to add the write-offs related to the securitized receivables last year. They were about $500 million. So the actual comparison is about $1,350,000,000 compared to the $810 million that we had this year. So the reserve level we have reflect our credit performance and the inherent risk in the portfolio and you can see that we have reduced lending reserves by $560 million. Next, on Slide 20, we look at lending reserve coverage. And as you saw on the prior slides, credit metrics have been improving and we have reduced reserves based on our methodology. However, we continue to be cautious in setting reserves as the economic environment remains uneven and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Here, you can see the reserve coverage ratios in the U.S. and on a worldwide basis. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment. So next is our capital ratios. And so while the capital requirements, what they'll actually be is still evolving, our capital position and ratios remain strong, particularly Tier 1 common. And you can see that it has increased from 10.7% in the second quarter to 11.7% in the third quarter. One other thing that I would note is that it's our plan in the fourth quarter to repurchase shares approximately equal to the 15 million shares that we issued under employee programs over the past four quarters in the fourth quarter of this year. So moving to Slide 22, this is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next month of funding requirements. Now the higher than normal level of excess cash is due to the funding maturities in the fourth quarter and the anticipated seasonal increase in the balance sheet associated with higher holiday spending in the fourth quarter. Now looking at Slide 23, this is our retail deposits. Now as accounts receivable and loan balances remains relatively consistent with the second quarter levels, we did not have demands for higher funding levels. So this quarter, we focused on reducing brokerage CDs and continuing to grow direct Personal Savings CDs and high yield savings deposits. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the first half of this year. Spending growth remains strong across all our business segments. In fact, on an FX adjusted basis, this was the strongest quarter ever in terms of dollars spent. We also continue to see further improvement in credit trends. Some of this is due to our strategic and risk-related actions. Some reflecting the post-recession behavior of consumers. Even through these trends have contributed to a divergence between consumer spending and borrowing levels, the net effect is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are the main driver of our volumes and receivable trends. Managed revenue growth of 5% improved versus prior quarters and outpaced our large industry competitors as strong Cardmember volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan balances and yields. Importantly, our strong billings growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense provided an ability to invest in the business at significant levels while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are driving metrics and improving revenue comparisons near-term but others are focusing on the medium to long-term success of the company. Challenges clearly remain in the U.S. in many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives are changing aspects of the business going forward. While we are currently investing at historically high levels, these factors have us approaching the future investments and spending commitments with caution. But the bottom line is that our strong competitive position is yielding high-quality results that spending on our network continues to increase well above industry average and our credit performance remains best among major card issuers. This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening. Ken and I are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I was wondering what changed in the quarter for you from the prior conference calls. In the last call, if I remember correctly, you'd indicated that marketing spend had peaked in the second quarter. So what were you seeing in the environment? Secondly, regarding the other expenses, the $251 million. I was hoping you can go on a little more detail there because it's up dramatically off the prior quarter and the quarter before that and I'm wondering if there is any type of one-time spending in that number.\nDaniel Henry: I think last quarter we had $802 million, which is probably the peak that we had seen at that juncture. But as we've said, as credit improved, we were going to continue to invest. And so credit continued to improve, Billed business continued to be very strong and so we actually elevated marketing spend to a somewhat higher that you saw in this quarter. And what you see in operating expense as what we said and the reason -- I think we provide the new bubble chart that we've had for a couple of quarters, is that investments are not solely marketing and promotion. Certainly, marketing and promotion is one aspect of our investments, in terms of acquiring customers and stimulating spending with existing customers. But investments also include being on the right capabilities, having the right talent to move forward with our new business initiatives and it also includes investing in higher sales force for both our Merchant business and our Commercial business. So I think the increase that you're seeing in operating expense is a reflection of that. So as long as we have strength in the business, we'll continue to invest at higher levels.\nKenneth Chenault: I would say given the momentum that we're seeing in a range of businesses, and the opportunity that we have to invest, we obviously want to continue that moving aggressively.\nDaniel Henry: I think this is part of what we've talked about I think for some time, which is really the flexibility that we have in our business model. But we have this strong performance in spending by our customers and the improvement that we're seeing in credit. We're going to flex up and invest at a higher level. As those diminish, we'll flex back down our investment to more traditional levels. But I think we've demonstrated that in '09, we can flex down, but when we have the opportunity, we can also flex up. So we want to take some of that and improve the bottom line. I think you saw a significant improvement in the bottom line but we also want to invest to drive business momentum going forward.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: But when I think about the run rate, my question is more along the lines of \u2013 is a lot of that going into the $251 million one-time to build capabilities and you'll see that investment slowdown again, that's what I'm getting at.\nDaniel Henry: So I think that when we get back to a more normal state as it relates to provision. I think you'll see marketing spend back more to where we were, say, in the '05 to '07 timeframe and I think you'll see operating expense not grow at the levels that it's growing today. It may be not the level that we had back in '07 because I think the nature of our business is changing somewhat and you can see that we're investing in businesses that are more fee related and that generally will be driven by operating expense. But we will continue to be focused on having the right margins in PTI. So that's something we'll focus on going forward.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Ken, I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on PCF suit to try to block the Durbin amendment.\nKenneth Chenault: Frankly, I have not studied that closely so I really can't shed a lot of light on that at all. Obviously, debit is an important piece of business to them. They're very focused on it but that's not something I frankly spend a lot of time on.\nOperator: We'll go to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Understanding the answer that you just gave to Craig, I'd like to ask maybe a bigger picture question as it relates to how you see the credit card market and the charge card market evolving with obviously a lot of competition focused on the high-end. If you think that some of these costs in particular rewards are you want to be in essence at a higher run rate going forward so despite your interest and maybe pulling back at some point in the future that you don't have quite as much flexibility, if you could give me any kind of sense as to how you're thinking about that any early thoughts about competitor moves as they begin to target the employment market again?\nKenneth Chenault: First, if we just step back a little bit is one, it is not new news that we've had a number of competitors literally over the past 20 years on the premium segment. And the reality is that I think that certainly rewards are important, it's important to have a diversified rewards program. And it's clear that our competitors and ourselves are investing more in those capabilities, but at the end of the day, what we've been able to demonstrate is that we're getting very good returns from those investments. It's less clear, given the difference between a lend centric and spend centric model, if our competitors, in fact, will enjoy the same types of economics. But we've proven that we can impact those levers. The third piece that I think is very important is if we just look at the backdrop of the last 18 months and look at the disproportionate growth that we've been able to generate against our competitors, when in fact, some of our competitors have dramatically increased their marketing and advertising spending, it does not seem to have had a damaging impact, in fact quite the contrary, we have accelerated our growth and our market share improvement. The last piece that I think I would emphasize very strongly is that we have, in fact, made investments, we have concentrated on improving our service quality and our capability of service, both online and offline. It is easy to replicate a feature on a card product. It is much harder to deliver consistently high quality service. And if I go back to the J.D. Power award, frankly, and I won't name names, but if you take a look at the list of issuers, and those who are saying that they're focused on the premium market, some of them in fact are in fifth and sixth and seventh place. And we in fact have won for four years in a row. So one of the things is we clearly understand the causality of segmenting our customer service and providing it. So I think it's a focus, certainly, rewards are important, features are important, services important but the momentum that we generated over the last year and the fact that, that moment is increasing. So that gives me a lot of confidence going into the Premium segment. But as I said earlier, when I was going through some of the trade-offs, I really do believe that someone who has a lend-centric model, which is most of the traditional bank card issuers, are going to have to substantially reconfigure their business models to compete effectively going forward because they have the impact, some of them of debit, they have the impact of the changes in pricing. And they've got to find some of the formulas that will allow them to really come up with a premium value proposition that resonates with the consumer.\nDaniel Henry: So the only thing I'd add to that is that part of putting a value proposition in the marketplace that consumers want to use and we're seeing them use our product, part of that is having a valuable rewards proposition. And so going forward, it's likely that you'll see that rewards, as a percentage of revenues, will be slightly higher than we may have seen in the past. And we recognize that and that means that we need to be very focused on operating expense efficiency, which we are, and a combination of all those things, again, I think will provide economics that are very attractive.\nKenneth Chenault: The only other point I would make because you really do have to connect the dots on all that is going on that as you improve the value proposition of your premium products, in fact, the value proposition to the merchant improves because the merchant wants to generate more spend, they're going to get that from those customers that carry premium products and that will spend more. And that's why our average spend is four times that of Visa and MasterCard. So I think what's very critical is you got to look at what we call this virtuous circle, that you've got to have a improved value proposition that customers really want, and obviously, then get those customers who will spend more so their value proposition at merchants is enhanced. And in these economic times, we're finding that to be incredibly valuable.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: And could you reiterate, you had mentioned, Dan, the momentum coming into the fourth quarter was equally strong from a growth perspective, and also do you have any thoughts as to maybe whether credit has the capacity to trend well below the historical norm, which seems like you're getting they're very quickly if you think that we're actually kind of looking at a sustained period of very low credit losses given the nature of the underwriting over the last few years, please?\nDaniel Henry: What we indicated is Billed business month-to-date and October growth rate was similar to the growth rate that we saw in the third quarter. Now in terms of credit, I think we're all keenly aware that our credit has improved at a far more rapid pace than the industry. And I think where it will settle out will obviously in each period dependent in part on the economy, but I think it will be impacted by the strategies that we've put in place where we're focusing on charge and premium lending. So to the extent that's our focus going forward. I think it's reasonable to have an expectation that it could be somewhat lower on average and overtime than what we may have seen before when we participated more broadly in the lending space.\nOperator: We have a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Question on International, I wonder if you could give us some color as to what kind of investments you're making in the non-U.S. space, it seems like one of the opportunities. And I guess I'm wondering if you have anything in the works to expand your presence overseas.\nDaniel Henry: Right. So we believe that there is opportunity for strong growth outside the U.S. We are actually increasing slightly the allocation of investments to more globally outside the U.S.\nKenneth Chenault: And that has been the case over the last several years.\nDaniel Henry: And so we're focused really on two things. What are the right acquisitions that we should make in our proprietary markets, how can we further stimulate our current customers? And then quite frankly, how can be kind of optimize internationally between what we do on a proprietary basis and what we do with GNS partners? And that has been our focus and is going to continue to be our focus as we go forward.\nKenneth Chenault: The other point I would make is that we're making substantial investments across our Payments business, our Global Merchant Services business to bring on more merchants, that's something that we have invested in outside the U.S. as well as the U.S. And the other point that I would make is that our GNS business not only helps us acquire card and acquire spending, but also allows us to expand our merchant coverage. So we have been very pleased, I think as you saw from the numbers, in International, the growth that we're generating and in fact, the innovation that's taking place in those markets. So that the priorities that we have listed for growth international remains one of our top priorities.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Because when people just look at the simple charts of merchant acceptance, it looks like there's a gap and that you need to spend some investment dollars on filling that and...\nKenneth Chenault: And that is exactly what we're doing. As you went through some of those bubble charts from Dan, the reality is that in the operating expense line, we are expanding our sales force, and we have expanded that, our sales force, in the international markets for coverage. And so you\u2019ve got to look at two ways that we're doing that, one is we are increasing our proprietary sales force and then in the bank partnership deals that we're doing, in a number of those deals, we're also able to get our partner to expand merchant acceptance. So that's something that we're very focused on. And obviously, you will see the impact of that over the next several quarters. So it's not something you\u2019re going to see in 30 days but you'll see it over the next several quarters.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: And so a dollar invested in the U.S. versus a dollar invested in the non-U.S. market, which one has the faster growth rate or profitability associated with it?\nDaniel Henry: So I think it depends on the investment. So I don't think there's a blanket statement that international is better than U.S. I think it's really depending on what the product is and what the nature of the investment is. And as we've said, we try to concentrate some of our investments about things that give us a near-term return and others are more focused on the medium to long term. But even the near-term investments, when you take a sales person on, you need to train them, they need to get seasoned. And so all of these things that we do when we evaluate investments, we're not evaluating what's the benefit three quarters from them, we're really evaluating what's the value that's created over the life of either the sales person, the merchant, the cardmember that we're acquiring here. And that's how we evaluate investors.\nKenneth Chenault: I just like to emphasize, I mean, you really got to separate out what I\u2019d call the card acquisition investments from the sales force investments because they have a longer tail. But the impact of those investments, as we have seen over the years in middle market and large corporate, have been substantial even though it is a longer tail. And the other point that I would make is as a result of consolidating the card businesses under Ed Gilligan, we're able to more quickly make portfolio acquisition changes of how we're going to allocate those dollars across markets and across products that has really helped us in a major way.\nOperator: We'll go to Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Just wanted to make sure I understood on the regulatory challenges and I know obviously they're all challenges, but you're making the case that the Durbin amendment because of the differential between credit products and debit products and as well as cash and checks is a bigger threat than the DOJ case because of the smaller differential between you and Visa, MasterCard?\nKenneth Chenault: Yes, look, the point I'm making is that if you go through debit, and just don't listen to me, in fact, as you go through the pronouncements from a range of banks, what they're saying is that their revenues are being impacted by billions of dollars. Because you have this double whammy squeeze going on is you have the squeeze going on the issuing side and what the features are going to be and then you have the issue of the potential of a lower interchange rate. So one, at the end of the day, we're not in the debit card business. But the point is that if you review the earnings releases and the statements that I've read from major banks, they're the ones saying that debit will not be as profitable, that they in fact, some have said on an individual basis that they're going to lose billions of dollars in revenues. Now the point for us that I think is critical while it's hard to speculate on what the individual impact will be on us, the reality is what's not new news is that we know that merchants don't have to accept our products. And we have to earn a premium rate every day by providing them with premium value. And as I said earlier, what we have seen, particularly in this environment, is that merchant\u2019s value spending and that our average spending is three to four times the size of Visa and MasterCard. And they also value, which we are increasingly doing, we are providing them with information, insights, marketing help and all of which we think help tremendously because we're seeing it that it helps with the acceptance of the card but also is providing us revenues in some of the particular services that we provide. So I think at the end of the day, premium value is at the core of what we do with merchants, and at the end of the day, we face a very competitive marketplace in terms of merchant pricing, I might add not just in the U.S., but all over the world. But I think what we've demonstrated very strongly in a very tough economy is that we\u2019ve continued to succeed and grow because of our ability to compete on value. And I have no doubt that, that will continue to be the case in the U.S.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: I saw you guys took off the fee on your Starwood co-brand card this quarter, was that fairly broad-based with other co-brand products as well and would that have been reflected in this quarter?\nKenneth Chenault: I think what's important, and this is where innovation comes in, if you're a premium value provider, you've got to innovate. And so what you saw on the Starwood product is we refreshed that product and added some attractive features that increased the value. And at the end of the day, you can't call yourself a premium provider if you're not consistently adding premium value. And so that's what we did on Starwood. And we believe that we're going to get fair value for that product and we think that the increase is very, very fair, related to the value. But that is a fundamental principle when you're in the premium value business is that you have to innovate and we will continue to innovate. And when we innovate and when we increase our value, if you really are a premium provider then you should be able to charge a premium price.\nOperator: We have a question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I just had a couple of questions for Ken based on his commentary. First was just in your conversations with the top merchants, do you believe those merchants would steer customers from credit to debit? And then secondly, was wondering if you guys have had continued dialogue with the DOJ and if it were possible to come up with some kind of agreement before going to trial? And one other question for Dan, just if you could elaborate on the net interest yield trends going forward? I'd appreciate that.\nKenneth Chenault: I think I'd say, Sanjay, the same point that I made before. The reality is that we have continued to provide substantial value to our merchants. And the spread certainly between credit and debit is larger. However, there is not much evidence that merchants are taking the risk of steering customers. And I think that's a very important point. And what is critical to emphasize is that merchants have had the right to steer from credit to debit. They can do that now. And I think that what is very important is that merchants recognize that what you don't want to do is alienate your good and best customers. And fortunately, we have good high-spending premium customers, that's the last group that frankly you want to alienate. So we have not seen much evidence of that happening.\nDaniel Henry: So to go to your second question, Sanjay, if you look at Slide 9, you can see that back in the third and fourth quarter of '08, we were at 8.9% yield. We put in pricing changes which were intended to mitigate the impact of the CARD Act. So you can see in the first quarter of '09 that, that popped up and through '09, kind of stayed in the high-nines, maybe 10%. Now that the CARD Act is taking effect, you can see that it\u2019s migrating back down, and we would expect that it's going to migrate back down over time to something in the high 8% or 9% range and that would be very much in line with what our expectations were.\nKenneth Chenault: Sanjay, I just want to come back to one point on steering that's worthwhile emphasizing and is critical is unlike Visa and MasterCard, merchants are not compelled to accept us. We have to prove that every day. And I think that is a very, very important point that we've got to sell value to merchants. Merchants are under no obligation to accept us. And what's important for us is we've got to demonstrate that value, and that's why we have to individually negotiate with each merchant to demonstrate that value. The point is that I think we have demonstrated over the years and certainly over the recent years, particularly how we've come out of the downturn on the billings that we are generating that merchants are strongly seeing that value.\nDaniel Henry: So one of the things I just mentioned, as an add on to what I said about yield, and that's our expectations will go back to historical levels. But the one caveat to that is to the extent customer behavior changes, then that could potentially impact that.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: On then just on the DOJ question I had?\nKenneth Chenault: Look, the reality is I'm not going to go through legal strategy. What I've said is we think we have a very strong case. We are going to defend ourselves. We think that the DOJ case is a weak case for all the reasons that we have outlined. And that's the position we're taking.\nOperator: We'll go to Drew Dampier with Meredith Whitney.\nDrew Dampier: On a percentage basis, your travel commissions and fees jumped fairly dramatically. Can you just clarify if that line includes your Travelers Cheques and Prepaid business, and what the main driver of that year-over-year growth was?\nDaniel Henry: So Travel Sales does not include Prepaid or the Travelers Cheques business. I mean the growth that we saw in Travel sales, which was both in consumer and corporate I think is a function of really the resilience that we're seeing in our total customer base. And I think it's also being heavily driven by Airline, where we're seeing both an increase in price and the number of transactions. So I think probably that's the largest driver of increase in Travel Sales.\nOperator: We have a question from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Just on your repurchase, I was wondering if you had to get any certain approvals for that and if you intend to continue the repurchase? And then a question on the lawsuit as well, has any other government around the globe attempted to litigate against private contracts, individual contracts? Anything similar to this lawsuit? And when I think in other markets that have regulated interchange, they haven't attempted to regulate your discount fee? Just maybe a little color on that would be helpful.\nDaniel Henry: So I'll take the first question. So the question is do we need to have conversations with the regulators before we do repurchases, and the answer to that question is yes. At the moment, what they've given us the go-ahead on is to the extent we've issued shares related to our employee programs. And it really covers what those issuances were over the last four quarters. I think what we've seen in repurchases in financial services to date for ourselves and others is really related to employee planned issuances. Certainly, as we go forward, we intend to have conversations with regulators on what our plans would be in terms of repurchases going forward. And we'll probably start those discussions within the next month or so.\nDaniel Henry: Bob, in answer to your question, what I would say is in at least everything I know and in all the markets where actions have been taken in place relative to the interchange rate, they have all been directed to Visa and MasterCard because they're the dominant payment networks. So that's been the focus. So it's a question that I would really put to them because they really have been the subject, the focus, not us.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Just one quick question on the international. The revenue growth in international was lower than the spend growth, revenue growth. I think the discount fee growth in the mid single digits and spend in the mid double digits. Or is the discount fee coming down international or what's -- why the gap between revenue growth and spend growth?\nDaniel Henry: Yes, I think one aspect of that might be FX is affecting the growth rate as it relates to revenues. I don't think there's any markedly different trend in discount rate internationally compared to what we're seeing in the U.S.\nOperator: We have a question from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: I wonder, Ken, could you talk about whether you think there's any significance to the fact that the Justice Department didn't pursue a change in surcharging rules at this point?\nKenneth Chenault: I can't really comment what their intent is or what their strategies are. So I couldn't really make any informed response to that.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Any other color you could share with us about the conversations you've had with merchants since the lawsuit was announced aside from...\nKenneth Chenault: Yes, I mean at the end of the day, what I would say is the conversations have been very constructive and very supportive. And the only thing I will say is at least we've also heard from different people in the media who have talked to merchants and have not been able to identify a merchant who is saying that they are going to steer as a result of what the DOJ is doing. And very frankly, exactly the points that I've made, the reality is people are saying there's no surprise that you charge a higher price. This is not new news. You give us a lot of value and we like the business that you generate. So very frankly, the conversations have been pleasant, constructive, supportive.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: And then I wonder if you could explain what happened with total and basic cards in U.S. this quarter? They're down about 900,000, they were up last quarter, is there some anniversary of free promotion or something?\nDaniel Henry: It really has to do with a change that we made as it relates to certain GNS cards. We had an issuance with a large partner and included all the cards that had been issued. Now some of those cards to the extent they're only used in store don't really generate revenues for us so we made the decision that we should not be including those cards. So that is actually the fact that is driving the reductions in card numbers.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: Was it Macy's cards?\nKenneth Chenault: No, not Macy's.\nDaniel Henry: But we think it's a better reflection of the cards that are actually generating revenues for us. It was really a one-time change in policy that drove that. It was 1.6 million cards that we actually backed out related to that.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: And so if we want to have an apples-to-apples comparison with Q2 we take the same 1.6 million out of Q2?\nDaniel Henry: That would be correct.\nDavid Hochstim - Bear Stearns: And then just last thing, on Slide 18, we have 30 days past due to write-off there was a nice decline in July and then a little bit of an uptick in August and September, can you explain what happened?\nDaniel Henry: That's just a processing blip that we shouldn't focus on. In fact, that goes back -- the dip if you took it back to the beginning, relates to last February. And we were actually in the process of just adopting new GAAP [ph] (1:18:04) and had to change some of the cycle cuts. In addition to that, February is just a shorter month. So what happened is more items fell into the first roll rate that made therefore the denominator in this calculation higher. But in the end, it rolled down to the same manner of write-offs. So that's why you have that little bit of a dip. So it's not an indication of a change from a credit perspective, it's just the mechanics that took place in the system in February.\nOperator: We have a question from Bill Karachi with Macquarie.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Ken, just for the sake of argument, let's assume for a second that you're not bound to have market power. So as you think about managing the business going forward, is market power something that you need to be conscious of so that you don't ultimately achieve it for obvious negative regulatory consequences? Or is market power just something that you don't think will ever really be a concern given you\u2019re focused on the premium customer segment, and therefore, that would be something that would make market power not something that would ever be a concern. Could you just share some of your thoughts around that?\nKenneth Chenault: Here's my view. I'm a growth-oriented guy. I want to grow, and at the end of the day, if I grow to a substantial level under the legal definition of market power and I have market power, I don't have a problem with that. So our focus is on growing the business, we think we have a range of opportunities across payments and services to grow. And what I've said to our management team and our employees is I want us to be a growth company, even in a slow growth environment. And so, the reality is we are now the smallest. And so what I'd separate out is where we are today and there are obviously the legal issues with that. But I think we are very comfortable in a world where I have to prove that we provide value to our customers every day. And at the end of the day, my objective is growth, profitable growth.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: One other question on your fee-based initiatives, can you give us a sense of whether -- it seems like all of these things that you mentioned earlier, the CARD Act, Durbin, the DOJ suite regi (sic) [regulation], all of these things, the impact on the pull of profits around cards is clear. But to what extent are the fee revenues that you would generate from your network in these fee-based initiatives not impacted by that? Is that fair to think about it that way or would those potentially be exposed?\nKenneth Chenault: No. I think it's fair to think about it that way. I mean the reality is obviously, we cross-sell services to customers. So if we couldn't acquire cards or we couldn't retain cards, that would have an impact. But at the end of the day, if you look at our fee services strategy, we are offering fee services to our card customers, we're offering fee services to merchants, we're offering fee services to non-cardmembers. And so I think we have a lot of options and the other point that I would make is with our enterprise growth group, under Dan Shulman, we'll be talking with you in the weeks and months to come about the growth opportunities there. And I would say that the vast majority of those growth opportunities are not related to impacts from the CARD Act. All that said, I want to reinforce, even in the CARD Act, we have a fundamental difference because of our spend-centric model against a lend-centric model that were less reliant on spread revenue and back end fees. That is a major difference in our model and why I think we've been able to navigate through those changes in a way that has put us in a better competitive position than the traditional bank card issuers.\nOperator: We'll go to Jason Arnold with RBC Capital Markets.\nJason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: One market where you've seen regulatory impact in your business from a steering or surcharge perspective already is Australia. And while I know your business is growing and you've been taking share in that market, I'm curious if there's any way to quantify the impact you've seen here in this market as measured on a discount fee or perhaps ROE perspective?\nKenneth Chenault: I think the only points that we would make there and obviously we've been very clear that the two markets are different. And we certainly did see a lowering of our discount rate. That was clear. But because of the fact, and this is the point that we have emphasized, because we have the most diversified business model, payments business model in the world, we had other business and revenue and economic levers that we could pull. And so that's why we're in a situation where Australia is generating good growth and good financials. Now I would add that didn't happen overnight. We had to adjust to those changes. But I think what we were able to demonstrate is that we were able to adjust and actually create not only a viable business, but in fact, a very well-performing business that has gained profitable market share over the last several years.\nJason Arnold - RBC Capital Markets Corporation: And then just one quick one for Dan. I was just wondering if you could talk about where the Care and re-aging program stand in the size of the loans outstanding here?\nDaniel Henry: So the Care Program continues in place, still a very difficult environment. It hasn't grown in size substantially nor has it really declined in size. As we've said, with respect to those customers, we're very conscious of how they're performing so we understand the economics related to them. And in total, it's not a very large program. So I would say it's on an equal footing to where it's been over the last couple of quarters.\nOperator: We have a question from John Stilmar with SunTrust.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Ken, to dove tail on the last quarter with regards to Australia, I believe that in Australia with the right to surcharge, one of the dynamics that's been happening is Visa and MasterCard merchants are allowed to apply a surcharge differently to American Express versus Visa and MasterCard. But over the time since the implementation of Australia's rules, the surcharge differential has been narrowing. And other than the qualitative that it's been narrowing that we've heard from you in the past, is there any sort of numerical evidence that you can share with us that shows that American Express has taken on Visa and MasterCard with regards to parity and at the point of sale with merchants?\nKenneth Chenault: I think here's the point. The reality is that even with surcharging, our fundamental positioning is the same that we provide substantial incremental value and plus business to merchants. So we have been successful and in fact, pushing back surcharging. That was one of the points that I was implying is when it first happened, it certainly took some time for us to adjust, but what we were very encouraged and we saw very tangible results is that we, in fact, were able to successfully reduce substantially the level of surcharging that was taking place because we were able to not only convince, but demonstrate the plus value that we were bringing to the merchant so the merchant no longer saw the value of surcharging. And so the reality is it exists still in some places but it has been substantially reduced. And again, as we look at our share of billings, our market share has increased which is concrete proof that, obviously, we\u2019ve been able to successfully deal with surcharging. So it goes back to this fundamental point that the premium value positioning and premium value in your cards and premium value for your merchant really does work in the marketplace.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Is there any numerical evidence that you can -- or some more disclosure that you can say in terms of the pace of that improvement and how it occurred other than sort of what we can glean from the governmental releases?\nKenneth Chenault: What I would say, frankly, the government releases the data. The data shows conclusively that we have gained substantial share in Australia over the last several years. So it's not our data. It is the government's data that demonstrates that we've grown share. And our earnings have improved and so it's profitable market share growth. But what it also points out is the diversity of our business model and that we have a Consumer Card business, we have a Corporate Card business, both large corporate and middle market, we have a GNS business and we have been able to pull the levers of those different businesses to create a business model that in fact, has worked very well.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And, Dan, just a quick point on revisiting, I'm not sure I got the question of the jump in other expense this quarter. Is that temporary? Should we think about that? What was the driver there and how should we think about that going forward?\nDaniel Henry: So the jump in operating expense in part is being driven by investments. So when we're increasing investments, we're not only increasing them in the marketing and promotion line, we're also making investments that get reflected in operating expense. So technology spending to support growth in our products, initiatives such as investing in Revolution Money or Business Insights or LoyaltyEdge or growing our sales force, those are all things that we're running through operating expense. And just like marketing and promotion, those are at elevated levels. When we get to the point where credit isn't showing off as much in terms of reserve releases, we'll bring those more back to normal levels, but investment levels that are sufficiently healthy to enable us to sustain business growth going forward.\nKenneth Chenault: The other point I would make is, again, because we talked about the sales force expansion. But as we said in the earnings release, the investments that we've concentrated on for example, Charge Card and co-brand, are paying off. We are generating those results and you see them in the quality of cards that we've been able to perform. If you go back to the analyst meeting in August, we actually took you through the increase that we were seeing in spending from the new cards that we were bringing on, not just compared to 2009, but compared to previous years. And so what you're really seeing is a partial redirection of our payment strategy where we're focused on more select segments for lending, we're concentrating on premium lending. And Charge Card, frankly, has become more of a product for the times. Consumers are becoming more disciplined. They're becoming more careful. And at the end of the day, the services, the rewards that we have on those Charge Card products is very appealing to a number of segments. So there, you are seeing relatively quick payback from the investments that we've made over the last year.\nOperator: And that will be from Brad Ball with Evercore.\nBradley Ball - Evercore Partners Inc.: I wonder if you could comment on the proportion of your spending that is currently in T&E and what the trends have been of late. Is that still coming down as it has over several years? And the reason I ask is, Ken, is it possible that you would have different merchants, sort of a tiering of merchants react to their new powers differently, maybe higher-end merchants, luxury sales merchants more likely to not steer a discount and lower-end merchants sort of more motivated to do the steering. How do you see that?\nKenneth Chenault: Yes, I think the reality is we\u2019ve continued to see the T&E related volume categories expand. And so non-T&E in the U.S. is approximately 72% of our U.S. Billed business.\nDaniel Henry: So you're right, over time, we\u2019ve really transitioned from kind of 2/3 T&E to really more than 2/3 non-T&E. In the near term, just in a very short term now, the bounce back that we've seen is really across all category, it's all segments, it's all geographies. So T&E is bouncing back along with other spending in this very short term.\nKenneth Chenault: And I think, Brad, it really represents a strategy. Frankly, if you go back to 2000, we, in fact, talked about the fact that we were going to focus on non-T&E. And very frankly, even in our Commercial Card business, that is one of the priority areas and we've had -- that we've also invested in this year where we had been very pleased with the progress that our non-T&E spending has increased. And frankly, what that makes for is a more balanced model. So as we go through different economic times, we don't have the reliance on some of the T&E categories that we had historically. So that frankly gives us more balance and puts us I think in a more stable situation, where we are less reliant on T&E categories. So I think what's important to understand is that non-T&E is very key to the success we've had in both our billings growth but also our business mix. So I think that is a very good thing.\nBradley Ball - Evercore Partners Inc.: And in terms of the merchants potentially tiering? The question of whether different merchants would be more likely to steer than others, so higher end less likely...\nKenneth Chenault: Again I go back to that reality is that all merchants, as we go through the categories, are not just high-end merchants. And what they're really doing is they're focused on taking care of customers at the point of sale. I would go back to what Dan said, which is that we're seeing growth across all merchant categories, all merchants categories, small, medium and large. And I would go back to the other point that our conversations that we've had recently with a range of merchant categories have been very positive and constructive and supportive conversations. So the point to focus on is that what we want to deliver to our merchants, irrespective of size and category, is high-spending customers. That's really our focus. And we're providing that value, and the proof of it is in our disproportionate growth rates relative to the rest of the credit card industry. Kathy, I think that's going to be the end of the call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall. Please go ahead, sir.\nRon Stovall: Thank you, Greg. And welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.  As usual, it is my job to remind you of certain legal aspects around the call and tell you that this discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company's 2009 10-K report, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the second quarter 2010 earnings release and earnings supplement on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.  Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period, where Dan will be available to respond to your questions. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel Henry: Thanks, Ron. And let's start on Slide 2. See total earnings are up 13%, but the more appropriate line to look at is managed total revenues, which is down 1%. The reason for that is in '09, revenues did not include interest related to those receivables that had been securitized. If you exclude the ICBC gain that was in '09, revenues are actually up 2%. Income from continuing operations was $1.017 billion. '09 included two one-time items. One was the ICBC gain of $211 million pretax, and we also had re-engineering costs of $182 million pretax. So those more or less offset each other. EPS was $0.84, and that compares to $0.09 in the prior period. But you'll remember that in the second quarter of '09, we had a charge that was about $0.18 related to our repayment of TARP. So the better comparison is $0.27 last year compared to $0.84 this year, up significantly. And ROE increased to 23%. We go to Slide 3 and we look at Billed business. It increased 16%, or 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. It is now approaching the pre-crisis levels in Billed business that we had back in '08. Cards-in-force are relatively flat with last year. GNS is up 7% and proprietary cards are down slightly. If we look at average Cardmember spending, it increased 20% on an FX-adjusted basis, but if you exclude the card cancellations of 2.7 million cards last year in the second quarter, average Cardmember spend would be up 16%, which is very much in line with the increase in Billed business. Loans on a managed basis are down 9%, driven primarily by Cardmember behavior as well as our strategy which is changing the mix of receivables, as we are focused on premium lending in co-brand. Those customers tend to be more transactors and have higher pay-down rates. However, loans are down less than competitors and that's because we are having higher growth in spending by our Cardmembers and we have lower write-off rates. Travel is benefiting from a growth in transactions, as well as higher prices in Airline. If you look at Slide 4, there's more detail on Billed business. The bars represent Billed business each month. The lines represent growth rates for both reported and FX-adjusted. On an FX-adjusted basis, April and May grew 15% and June grew 14%, for the average of 15% in the second quarter. July month-to-date growth is in the double digits and the growth rate is down slightly from June due to a tougher rollover in 2009. If we move to Slide 5, this is information on network spending. And you can see that transactions are growing 8% and transaction size is higher by 6%. So they're both contributing to spending growth.  If we move to Slide 6, this is growth by segment. And you can see that we had strong growth across all of our segments. The highest growth is in GNS and this is being driven by partners issuing additional cards. Promotional Card also had strong growth, and this is in part due to new signings, as well as higher level of spending from existing clients. International Consumer had growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, and while it's slightly lower than the other segments, this is due in part by the fact that it dropped less in 2009. So we have broad-based growth in spending. We'll have to wait until all the statistics are in, but it would appear that we will gain share in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 7. Now this is some new disclosure that we thought that you would be interested in. It's spending by region. You can see that JAPA has the highest growth and this is in part driven by new GNS signings in Australia. We also expect that EMEA growth would be slightly below the average, but it's still strong at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis. If we move to Slide 8, this is spending by product within the U.S. Consumer and Small Business Group. And it represents the spend decline or growth over the past five quarters. And you can see that in the current period, we are having strong growth in both charge and co-brand and this reflects the investment spending in these areas, consistent with our strategy. And we've had more modest growth in proprietary lending. So before I leave spending, let me make a few points. Spending on our network is growing faster than the industry in charge and credit. Spending growth is broad-based across segments and geography. Growth is concentrated in the areas of our strategic focus, charge and co-brand. And growth reflects our strategy of using improvements in credit to invest in the business. Let me move to Slide 9, and this is Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth. And we see here that Charge Card receivables continue to move in tandem with the growth in Billed business. Charge Card Billed business was 15%, consistent with last quarter. Moving to Slide 10. We're looking at lending, Billed business and managed loan growth. And here, lending, Billed business and managed loan growth, at this moment, is not closely correlated. It's in part because of actions that we've taken in terms of credit, as well as the change in our strategy to reduce acquisition and proprietary lending and focus more on premium and co-brand. It's also in part by Cardmembers looking to delever. You can see this if you look at our trust data and look at pay-down rates. Back in June of '09, pay-down was 24.2%. And in June of 2010, it was 28.9%. So we expect the difference in growth rates and spending in loans to continue over the near term. Let me move to Slide 11. So this is USCS net interest yield. And on the right, you can see that the yield was 9.3% in the second quarter of 2010, compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of '09. This change reflects the implementation of the CARD Act, the pricing actions that we put in place over recent quarters, which were designed to mitigate the impact of the CARD Act, as well as changes in customer behavior. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the impact from the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through repricing activities over recent quarters. Our objective is to migrate back to the historical yield level of 9%. We believe our pricing is appropriate and reflects the necessary revenues for our business. But uncertainty does exist regarding the impact of the look-back or regulatory review required on a go-forward basis. Staying with the CARD Act, we do not expect the revised late fee rules, which will be implemented in August, to have a material impact. We believe the CARD Act is more significant for us than financial reform due to the nature of our business model, which is not impacted by many aspects of the reform. With regard to financial reform legislation, we support the general principle of financial stability and consumer protection underlying the legislation. However, there clearly are costs associated with it. Many of the aspects will play out over time, giving us the ability to adopt to the changing marketplace. While other industry participants have discussed details regarding debit pricing risk pursuant to the Durbin amendment, our Charge Card and credit cards are not directly impacted by the potential debit pricing adjustments. With regard to discounting, while merchants have long had the ability to provide discounts for payment of cash and check, the additional ability of merchants to discount price for payments with debit cards versus credit cards creates some additional uncertainty. However, based on our commitment to deliver high-quality customers and services to merchants, we are confident in our ability to adopt to the changing environment. So let me get back to our second quarter results and move to Slide 12. This is a summary of our revenue performance. So discount revenue is driven by 16% growth in Billed business and is impacted by the higher growth in GNS and increased contra revenue related to co-brand partner investments. Net interest income for 2010 includes all the interest on all loans. 2009 does not include the interest related to those loans that were securitized. On an apples-to-apples basis, 2010 remains the same at $1.188 billion. 2009 would be $1.464 billion, so that would be down about 19% on a managed basis. And that's a result of average loans being down 10% and the yield this year being at 9.3%, compared to 9.7% in '09. Travel commissions and fees are benefiting from greater foreign currency revenues related to higher spending and partly offset by lower delinquency fees. Other revenues, if you were to back out the ICBC gain from last year, last year's number would be 898 and we actually see an increase up to 982 this year. And that's reflected in part by higher GNS partner-related revenues. One last point that I'd make about revenues is that we had 4% growth in revenues sequentially, compared to the first quarter.  So let's move to Slide 13, which is provision for losses. So the provision for Charge Card and lending both are improving dramatically, based on the improved credit performance that we've seen. '09 provision does not include write-offs related to those loans that were securitized. If we included those, the provision would have increased to $2.420 billion, so that would mean a year-over-year improvement of $1.7 billion. Based on the improvement that we saw in credit performance, reserves declined $50 million in Charge Card and $450 million in lending, for a total reserve release of $500 million. As you will see in a few slides, our reserve coverage remains cautious. Let's move to Slide 14 and expense performance. So you can see that marketing and promotion is up significantly, up to $802 million, compared with $352 million last year. And I'd point out that last year was unusually low, as we were looking to stay profitable in '09. But the $802 million is above historic levels. So this is very consistent with what we've said in the past; as credit improved, we would drop some to the bottom line and the balance we would invest to drive business growth, some of it to help the near term, but we're also investing for the medium-to-long term. If we look at rewards, it is growing in line with the growth in Billed business. Salaries and benefits are lower by 4%. However, if we adjust for the re-engineering charge that we had in '09, it's up 8%, reflecting merit increases, resumption of the 401(k) match program and profit sharing, as well as higher incentive accruals, partly offset by lower levels of employees. The tax provision and tax rate are up, reflecting higher earnings and a $44 million charge related to valuation of certain deferred tax assets. Moving to Slide 15. This is now our spending levels over the past three years by quarter. Other than the fourth quarter of '07, when we received our initial Visa settlement payment, the second quarter of 2010 is the highest level on the chart; higher than the historic averages that we saw back in the second and third quarter of '07. If we were to compare our spending in the second quarter of 2010 back to that '07 period, within USCS, we see similar levels of spending on acquisition, but with a shift from proprietary lending to charge and co-brand. In ICS, International Consumer, we're seeing generally higher levels of spend across several areas. And within GMS, we're seeing a substantial increase in the investment and perception of coverage.  As discussed over the prior quarters, the high level of investment spending reflects the provision benefit as credit is improving. As you can see from the chart, we have the ability to adjust investment levels. As these provision benefits lessen over time, we have the flexibility to move investment spending back towards historic levels. I'll now move to Slide 16, which is information in terms of our operating expense. As we said to you, you should not look solely at marketing and promotion to judge our investment spending. Operating expense on average grew 8%. Within operating expense, you can see that support functions, which are organizations such as finance and other staff groups, and global services, are growing at a rate below the average. Collection expense is growing at a slower rate as credit improves. Above the dotted line, expense growth is growing faster than the average and there were some administrative costs, such as costs to comply with the new bank holding company and Basel II regulations, but the majority of the higher growth relates to expenses driving revenue growth such as sales force, network initiatives and partner investments. Moving to Slide 17, this is the USCS Charge Card write-off and past-due rates. And you can see that these metrics are improving and really, the reason that provision is lower. And you can see that the write-off rate and 30 days past-due continued to improve here.  If we move to Slide 18, this is International Consumer and Global Commercial Card. And again, here, you can see the net loss rate in the 90 day past-due billing ratio continues to perform very well. I'll remind you in the first quarter of 2010, that dark blue section in Q1 2010 was driven by a methodology change to do write-offs at 180 days, instead of the prior practice of 360. Moving to Slide 19, Charge Card reserve coverage. As you can see from this slide, while credit improves, reserve coverage remains cautious across all segments. The International Consumer and Global Commercial Services 90 day past billings coverage increased in 2010 as we changed reserve methods to be based on a lost-to-bill business ratio. And that was discussed with you last quarter. If we move to Slide 20, which is the managed lending net write-off rate, you can see that the write-off rate continues to improve in the U.S. and globally. Our metrics are performing substantially better than the industry and they're benefiting from the fact that we moved earlier and more decisively. And it also reflects the high quality of our Cardmember base. Our write-off rate is now down to 6%, and while this is still above historic averages, it represents a significant improvement from the second quarter of 2009. Next, we're looking at the lending 30-day past due. And again, here we're seeing good improvement both in the U.S. and globally. Delinquency dollars are at $1.6 billion this quarter, compared to $2.7 billion in the second quarter of '09. Again, a significant improvement.  If we look at Slide 22, here we're looking at roll rate information, which provides insight into why our write-off rates are improving and what might happen in the future. The write-off rate in the current month are a function of the current-to-30 day past-due roll rates five months prior. So the write-off rate in the second quarter relates to the green triangles in the upper left-hand chart. That's the chart on the current-to-30-day past-due. And they were lower than the prior three triangles. Therefore, second quarter write-offs were lower than the first quarter, and this is also dependent on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off rate, bankruptcies and recoveries remaining constant. You can see that the next three triangles after the green triangles are down slightly. I remind you that we are in uncertain economic times and that the third quarter write-off rate will also depend on the 30-day past-due-to-write-off percentage, bankruptcies and recoveries. Now the increase we saw sequentially in bankruptcies, the right-hand chart, in the second quarter is in line with the growth in bankruptcies in the industry. Moving to Slide 23. So this is reserve activity in the second quarter of last year and this year. The left side of '09 doesn't include reserve activity for those receivables that were securitized in '09. In '09, we billed $200 million of credit reserves, based on the fact that credit metrics were deteriorating. And we released $500 million of lending reserves in the second quarter of 2010, as credit continues to improve. The blue box in the top right provides information with respect to the write-off split between securitized and non-securitized loans. So if you were to compare the $1.1 billion of write-offs in the second quarter of '09, it would compare to the $600 million in the second quarter of '10. So while we released reserves, we believe we have an appropriate level of reserve coverage.  Now we can see that on the next slide, Slide 24. So we've seen credit metrics are improving and we've reduced lending reserves by $450 million in the quarter, based on the inherent risk in the portfolio. But we continue to be cautious in setting credit reserves, as the economic environment remains uneven, housing is stalled and unemployment remains stubbornly high. Our reserve coverage reflects the uncertainty that we see in the environment. Moving to Slide 25, our capital ratios remain above well-capitalized. Our Tier 1 common ratio of 10.7% is strong relative to other U.S. financial institutions. Now as we know, new rules will be written in the near future regarding capital and capital requirements, will be higher than they have been historically. But as you can see from the slide, our capital position today appears to provide a good foundation for those future requirements. Moving to Slide 26, this is our liquidity. We continue to hold excess cash and readily-marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we're holding $25 billion and maturities are $20 billion. Moving to Slide 27, you can see retail deposits increased by $300 million in the second quarter. We didn't need to grow deposits in the quarter to meet funding needs. We did reduce brokered CDs [Certificate of Deposit] by about $1 billion and continue to grow Personal Savings; both CDs and High-Yield Savings balances. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect both general improvement in the economic environment versus last year, and our shift to a more offensive investment posture. Spending growth was relatively strong across our business segments due to both higher absolute spending levels and the weak volumes last year amidst a global economic slowdown. In fact, on an FX-adjusted basis, this was the strongest second quarter in terms of dollars spent. We also continue to see a sharp divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategies and risk-related actions, and some reflects changes in consumer behavior. The net effect of these trends is a lower risk profile for the company, as charge and co-brand spending are a key driver of our volumes and receivable trends. While these offsetting influences, strong billings growth and lower loan balances challenge overall revenue growth, improving credit trends and well-controlled operating expense have provided the ability to invest in the business at a significant level, while also generating strong earnings. Some of these investments are intended to drive metrics in the near term, but others are allocated towards investments focused on the medium-to-long term success of the company.  Challenges clearly remain as global economic indicators have weakened somewhat, and sentiment seems to show less strength than most would've expected a few months ago. In the U.S. and many other key markets, job creation remains weak, consumer confidence is volatile, consumer behavior is uncertain and regulatory and legislative initiatives will change aspects of the business going forward. While these factors have us approaching investment and expense commitments with caution, our strong competitive position is yielding high quality results. Spending on our network has been increasing well above the industry average and our credit performance was the best among major card issuers. This indicates to us our decisive and effective credit actions are achieving improved credit performance without stifling spending by credit-worthy Cardmembers. This gives us confidence that our investments and differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to manage through our challenges, capitalize on opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we turn to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I wanted to ask you a question about the level of secular shift. How much is that still contributing, in your opinion, to your results right now versus true economic growth or rebound in spending?\nDaniel Henry: So to answer your question, I think that increased penetration into cash and checks, I think, will continue to occur over time. I think that will benefit both credit and charge segments. And it also will, over time, give yield to alternative payments, which is something that we are very focused on. So I think we're going to benefit both from our traditional business, our core business, as well as some of the areas that we are becoming more focused on. So I think it\u2019ll be gradual, but I think there\u2019ll continue to be a benefit from that.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Regarding the marketing spend, like you said, it\u2019s at fourth quarter of seven levels. How should we be thinking about that going forward? Should we be modeling sort of as long as we expect material reserve release, that the marketing spend will continue to see a big reinvestment?\nDaniel Henry: Yes, so I think that, as we said, when credit improves, both write-off rates dropping and having the ability to release reserves, that we were going to take a portion of that and invest in the business and to really help grow both in the near term and the long term. And I think you've seen that we have the ability to increase investments and take them down as appropriate. So I would say we'll continue to use benefits from credit to invest in the business, although I think over the long haul, we\u2019ll probably return to levels more similar to what you saw back in the '07 timeframe.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: So $800 million seems like a high watermark on a per quarter basis?\nDaniel Henry: I'd say based on the spending levels that we have today, I would agree with that. As revenues and Billed business grow, we will over time need to take investment spending to higher levels than we saw in '07, but since spending is back probably at the '07, '08 levels, I would think about marketing at those levels being investments at the level that we saw in '07.\nOperator: Next we turn to the line of Michael Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Thanks for the color on the spending by region. I was just curious, though, are you seeing any differential? I know in the past few quarters you said spending has been pretty broad-based. Could you maybe give us some color though on the different types of categories? Are you seeing greater strength in things like discretionary spending, high-end retail, versus the more nondiscretionary items at this stage yet?\nDaniel Henry: I think it\u2019s in the charts. It's broad-based in terms of segment. It's broad-based in terms of geography. I think you can see that commercial card is very strong. So we're seeing strong growth in T&E by corporations and middle market. I think we're also seeing strong growth in other travel areas, such as Airline, which is both having higher transactions and higher price per ticket, which is partly some of their pricing, but also seems to be people moving back up into the front of the plane as well. So I think all those things are helping in terms of spend. And those things are the types of things our customers, who have great levels of discretionary spending and who spend at higher ticket items, you'd expect to see.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Just an unrelated question. I just want to hit on the Durbin amendment. And I know in your comments it doesn't seem to suggest that you don't expect significant impact there, but could it actually help you from the standpoint of if banks now have to charge for debit usage, from that standpoint, maybe customers or less-end [ph] clients use debit, and more clients use credit? And then secondly, does it make your Charge Card product more attractive to potential bank issuers to just maybe recoup some of the lost revenues that they may be losing on debit?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So as you indicate, many of our competitors are going to be hit by the change in debit pricing that will take place. What's going to actually happen in the marketplace when you think about what the pricing for debit is going to be, what merchants may or may not do in terms of discounting to move customers from credit to debit will have to play out over time. And you can paint some scenarios where there would be a greater impact to us as people move from credit to debit. But there are other scenarios that could actually go the other direction as we see how both customers react, if banks have to change their pricing on those debit products to actually put fees on the products possibly, whether customers would actually move from debit to credit, where there isn\u2019t a fee. So I think there's a lot of scenarios out there and we're actually going to just have to wait and see how that plays out over time.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisory Group.\nMeredith Ann Whitney: Just wondering about the repeal of Rule 436(g) that happened yesterday. I'm just wondering how that affected your securitization funding going forward?\nDaniel Henry: So this has to do with the rating agencies. And I think there\u2019s actually something that just came out recently that's indicating that the SEC is going to weigh that for another six month period to see how it plays out. So I think it's not going to be an immediate issue through the next six months. Presumably, they'll work out some solution between now and then. But I would point out that we fund in a very diverse set of areas. We fund in the unsecured market, even if the traditional ABS market wasn't open because they couldn't resolve this, the 144 area within ABS where we could do funding, and we can do funding in deposits. So we have a wide breadth of funding available to us. So my sense is that we're not concerned about that. In all likelihood, that dispute will be resolved, but even if it wasn't, we see a wide variety of places for us to fund our business very effectively.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: My first question is that it appears that spending trends were holding firm throughout all three months in the quarter. Can you give us an early indication as to what you're seeing in July and if there's any particular indication that some of the pull-back that we've seen in the capital markets, if that\u2019s translating into consumer and commercial behavior at all?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So I think month-to-date July, we're seeing double-digit growth. It's down slightly from where we were in June, but that's really driven by the fact that it's a more difficult rollover compared to '09, in July compared to June. So it's still remaining strong.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: And any indication that there's been a change in behavior just based on what's going on either in Europe or just some of the weakness we've seen in the U.S.?\nDaniel Henry: What I'd say is despite the fact that there\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty in the marketplace, really, over the last four or five months, as you can see from our numbers, spending by our customers has been really very good. It's very broad-based. And the spending has performed better than the other networks and the other large card issuers. So we're very pleased by the results that we're seeing.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: You're hearing a lot of the competition is focused on the premium end of the market. I'm interested if you're seeing any action specifically that they are taking and what the response is by American Express, and if you think that some of the increased investment activity in service is going to be required in order to, in essence, keep your share of the premium market?\nDaniel Henry: So I think our competitors, probably over the past decade, have been very interested in the space that we operate. That's probably heightened by some of the legislation, which makes the economics at the lower end of the lending spectrum less attractive. And if we were not very diligent, then we would probably lose share, but we have been very diligent. We're very focused on the competition. We're very focused on continuing to improve the value proposition to our customers in terms of the rewards we provide, in terms of the service that we provide. I think everybody is well aware that for the past three years, we've been the number one service company in this industry and we continue to invest in that. So we are aware of the competition, but we continue to be confident in our ability to win in the marketplace.\nOperator: And next, we turn to the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.\nJohn McDonald - Bernstein Research: I was wondering if you could clarify the comment on the net interest yield in USCS? I thought you said that you thought you'd get back to 9% over time, is that right? Versus 9.3% in the second quarter?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. If you go back on that chart, I guess Chart 19 -- Chart 11, sorry -- you can see back on the left-hand side that we would generally have a yield of about 9%. In anticipation of the CARD Act, we put pricing changes in place which increased that. I think it peaked at about 10%. And the pricing changes we put in were really intended to mitigate the impact of the CARD Act. So if that all played out the way we intended, we migrate back towards about 9%. So one caveat I put to that is that we have this look-back in the regulation. We think the pricing changes we made are appropriate for our business model, but there is uncertainty in terms of when that look-back takes place and is reviewed by the Fed.\nJohn McDonald - Bernstein Research: Just to be clear, what would drive it down from 9.3% in the same quarter down to 9%? Is that still phasing in of CARD Act?\nKenneth Chenault: I think it's still the phasing in of CARD Act. It's customer behaviors as well, which is part of this. So I think it's all the factors that we think will impact us as we go over the balance of the year.\nJohn McDonald - Bernstein Research: The Visa and MasterCard settlement payments that you're getting, can you just remind us how long those last? And do they stay down or do they stay straight line at the same level until they go away?\nDaniel Henry: So they continue at the level they are through, I think, it\u2019s the second quarter of 2011. And then I guess it's the MasterCard that ends, and the Visa continues until later in, I think, the fourth quarter of 2011.\nJohn McDonald - Bernstein Research: At the same level?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. All of it, yes. Each of the payments from each of the networks are constant quarter-by-quarter, assuming our spend is achieved so the payments are contingent on spend. But we\u2019re highly confident that we'll hit those targets.\nOperator: And next, we turn to the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wondered if you could give us any color commentary on the marketing spend. $800 million of marketing spend is a big number. And obviously, you're benefiting on the spending side, but that's maybe more just a bounce-off of the bottom, and some of your higher spending customers increased their discretionary spend and the like. Is there any alternate in your results that you can point to that gives us any sense of the effectiveness of your marketing? I was looking at -- account growth still seems pretty muted. Is there anything else beneath the surface that you could point to? And also, a similar topic on the Charge Card business where I know you\u2019ve been spending a lot of money.\nDaniel Henry: So you're right. We have been focused on charge and co-brand, but we've also increased our investment levels compared to historical levels internationally because we see that as an area of growth. We also have increased spending within our merchant business on perceptions of coverage, because often, customers don't perceive that we have the coverage that we actually do. So we want to make sure that we're communicating that clearly. The investments we make, even the ones that get short-term benefit like card acquisition, we actually make those investments because of the lifetime economics that we have from the customers that we acquire. So we're getting benefit now, but we'll get it in the long term. Now in terms of your comment on cards-in-force, I just say that to the extent we acquire charge cards and co-brand, where customers spend at a higher level, it's more expensive to acquire those cards. So we wouldn't expect to have the kind of card growth that we had when we were acquiring large numbers of proprietary lending customers. I'd also say that we're going to give you more detail on this at the Financial Community Meeting that takes place in the first week in August. But just getting back to where we're spending the $900 million, I think you're going to see the benefit of that in the long term, but you're also seeing the benefit of that in our billings numbers. So we do think that the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to last year, and the higher volumes that we're achieving compared to the other networks, are due in part to the higher level of investments that we\u2019ve really made over the last several quarters.\nJohn McDonald - Bernstein Research: One quick follow-up just on the Durbin amendment and the ramifications. Have there been instances where discounting has become more prevalent in other geographies, and how did you deal with that? And also, any sense on your part for the appetite for credit interchange legislation?\nDaniel Henry: The one we can look to is Australia. Certainly, surcharging there took place and differential surcharging took place, and it had an impact in terms of the very early days of that. But over time, it has really moderated, and I think we've demonstrated in Australia our ability to adopt to the marketplace. And our business in Australia continues to be strong. And in fact, I think we've actually taken share there on our network compared to the others. So I think we have a business model that's adoptable to the environment that we face, and we have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to do that in the United States as well. In terms of credit interchange, there's been no discussion of that at the moment. On the other hand, anything is possible, but it's not on the radar screen at the moment. I think they have several hundred rooms to write already, so maybe they'll undertake getting that done before they head off in another direction. But we'll have to wait and see.\nOperator: And next, we turn to the line of Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Tax rate was awful high this quarter and you only had a $44 million charge in that number. If you look back before the downturn, you guys were in the mid-20s with an effective tax rate for many years. Is there anything -- are you assuming that you're going to have a higher tax rate? And if so, why and where do you expect to be?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So I think if I was looking at a historical tax rate, I think about it more in the low 30s. I think that's where we've been historically. Also, in this quarter, aside from the one item that I mentioned, also our income in the second quarter was higher than the first. So that causes the rate to increase, and we really have to cover the increase related to the first quarter that we didn't have in the rate then. So that's part of the impact as well. So you have to factor that in at the same time. But I would think about a normalized rate in the low 30s.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: In the low 30s? Because it was in the mid-20s from 2003 through 2008, 2007?\nDaniel Henry: So I don't have that data in front of me, but if you have a quarter without unusual items or settlements, I'd put it more in the low 30s.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: The Revolution Money, the hire you made yesterday in your alternative payments investments, first of all, can you give us a feel for what the P&L of Revolution Money looks like today and what your investment spend plans are?\nDaniel Henry: So Revolution Money we think is a great capability. It's something that we are looking at in terms of building out those capabilities. So we're investing in that during the current period. As we go forward, Dan Shulman will be very involved in the direction of Revolution Money and exactly what our strategies will be. I would view that as an investment certainly over the near term, but we think it's something that has potential and could be important to us as alternative payments evolve. So I think once Dan's in place and has a chance to look at it, I'm sure that's something that he'll be in a position to discuss with each of you in more detail.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Bill Carcache with Macquarie Capital.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Dan, can you give us a sense of what the percentage of your loan balance is now that consists of customers who are in the Care Program or similar programs, and just how that's been trending?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So we haven't disclosed that information. The number of balances in the Care Program are relatively low and have been relatively consistent, I would say, over the past couple of quarters.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: But is it fair to assume that we've seen some meaningful improvement in credit, both in terms of the net charge-off rates coming down and delinquency improvement? Is it fair to conclude that some of that improvement has been driven by a reduction in the number of Care Program participants? Basically, have they contributed to those improved credit results?\nDaniel Henry: I think the answer to that question is that has to be true, but I would say it's relatively minor, the impact. I think the vast majority of the improvement is a combination of the actions we've taken on the broad portfolio, as well as the fact that our customer base is of high quality. We acted early and decisively and we have a high-quality customer base, and that's really the primary reasons that we're seeing improvement in credit metrics across the board.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: And on another topic. We know about your presence in the gift card space, but can you talk more broadly about your interest in Prepaid, particularly in light of the favorable treatment that Prepaid's getting under the new legislation? It's really not something that I've heard you talk much about before. If you could just speak to that?\nDaniel Henry: So Prepaid is a relatively small business within the total company. It is an area that we are focused on. It is a company that we've had really pretty substantial growth in. It's an area that we'll continue to focus on in terms of investment. So we're playing in that space. And as I say, we've had good growth. But on a relative basis, it's a small part of the company.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: On the Consumer Financial Production Bureau, is there any way you can give us a sense -- I know these are early days, but how do you expect your daily actions as a business to change as a result of the creation of the CFPB? And what level of interaction are you anticipating having with it?\nDaniel Henry: I guess what I'd say is it's way too early to tell. The agency hasn't been created yet. And we'll have to wait and see exactly what rules they put in place, and then we will participate in that. But it's way too early to have any sense of what impact it could potentially have on the company.\nOperator: And next, we turn to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Looking at your Slide 24, it seems like the month coverage increased in the second quarter in the reserve, which seems kind of counterintuitive to the fact that credit's improving. I was wondering how we should think about it going forward. That's my first question. And then the second one is on the marketing. I was wondering if you guys have looked back in time and observed how long $1 of marketing spend translates to the top line benefit. Is there any info on that you could share, or maybe that's something you'll address at the FCM? But I'm just trying to figure out when we get the results from the second quarter spend.\nDaniel Henry: The reserve coverage, or how we set reserves, is really based on a model based on historical information. We also set specific reserves against certain categories where we think it's appropriate. And then we also have a factor that relates to the environment. And our reserve coverage is cautious because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment. Whether you look at unemployment, which is stubbornly high, if you look at consumer confidence, you'll look at where housing is, it's just very uneven. And for that reason, we are remaining cautious as we said, on reserves. If you turn then to your second question about marketing, certain types of marketing, such as card acquisition, we have models that can predict very accurately when we bring in customers, what kind of spending we're going to get and when we're going to get it. And we constantly update those models based on recent activities. Other types of investments, if you go to the other end of the spectrum and you look at Revolution Money, we\u2019re investing in a platform and developing capabilities. When we'll see the revenue from that will probably be some period of time in the future before it has a meaningful impact on our business. So we're really investing across a spectrum where we get some pretty immediate impact, a couple of months, and we see revenue in the top line, and others where it takes a longer period of time. And we believe it's very important to have investments that really go across the spectrum from short term to medium term to long term. So really, it depends on the investment. And then there are certain types of investments where it isn't as crystal-clear. So if you look at certain loyalty programs, we know in aggregate we get good returns on the aggregate loyalty programs we have. If you try to isolate that to one particular, it gets a little more difficult. If you look at marketing and advertising, clearly it\u2019s something we want to be in the marketplace with. But again, measuring that on a precise basis isn\u2019t as easy. So in some investments, you can see exactly when it's going to come; in others, it takes a longer period of time. So there's no formula I can give you to say, \u201cFor this dollars of marketing, this is the revenues that you should expect two quarters from now.\u201d\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Is that the component that went up this quarter, meaning the uncertainty component, which is why your reserve coverage went up? Or is it something else?\nDaniel Henry: I don't want to talk about each particular component. But certainly, the uncertainty that we see in the marketplace did not decrease in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.\nOperator: Next, we turn to the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: In the press release, there was a notation of potential acquisition. So I was just curious if you could put some parameters around that? Are we talking about fault on [ph] smaller acquisitions? And also, would they be more investment-related, like Rev Money, or could you actually do some accretive acquisitions?\nDaniel Henry: So I think that we are certainly open to acquisitions that will enable us to further our strategies. Certainly in the area of new fee revenues or alternative payments may be spaces where that could be very helpful to us. Some may be more in the line of Revolution Money, where we have the broad capabilities first, but others could be of the nature that will, in the very near term, drive earnings and revenues for the company. So I think it could fall into either of those two categories. And as we've said, we're very open to doing that to the extent that it can help us further some of our strategic initiatives.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: And would you be in a position to repurchase stock or is that down the road?\nDaniel Henry: So at the moment, that's not on the top of our agenda. But as you can see, our Tier 1 common capital ratio is strong at 10.7. It's something that we'll think about over the moderate term, but also will require a conversation, I think, with our regulators. So that's something we'll think about, but it's not in our agenda in the very near term.\nOperator: Next, we turn to the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: On the bankruptcy trend line, you mentioned that the increase of bankruptcies has been below what peers have seen. Is it still trending below your projections? I think that had been the case for the past two quarters, that the actual level of bankruptcy filings were lower than you were projecting?\nDaniel Henry: So I look at bankruptcies -- if you look at last quarter, and you can see on the chart that they dropped down. I think the industry was relatively stable in growth last quarter, but the increase that we saw in the second quarter compared to the first quarter was very much in line with industry trends. So you could see on Slide 22 that it was pretty stable for several quarters at around 70. Dropped down last quarter, as I said, to 65. In the industry, last quarter, growth was kind of stable. So we had performed a little bit better. But the increase that you see in the second quarter growth is very much in line with what the industry growth was.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And that's in line with, I guess, what your projections would be?\nDaniel Henry: So the impact to the bottom line is not only dependent on the filings but the actual size of the filings; what\u2019s the average balance in there. And also many of the filings that we received, we've already written off the account. So whether the mix is changing, and what the percentage of accounts already written off will also have a factor. So it's the filings combined with the average size, and what percent have already been written off really dictates what eventually falls through the P&L.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Within the marketing reward spend, was there any URR adjustments in there, the assumption behind redemption rates?\nDaniel Henry: There's always changes that are moderate, but there was nothing of note in the URR in this quarter.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: I know you talked about, I think, in the past conference call, revisiting targets in terms of ROE and some of the growth rates. Is that something that's going to be on hold until the regulators come out with more clarity on capital, or is that something you maybe plan to address at the Community Investor Day?\nDaniel Henry: Yes. So we will address that at the Financial Community Meeting. We're not going to know exactly where they'll set them, but we'll make an assumption, and then based on that assumption, we'll set some new guidelines for ROE.\nOperator: And next, we turn to the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: Just real quick question, and I hate to go back to the concept of marketing, but dovetailing on Sanjay's question, when you answered it, you clearly articulated a difference between investing in the short term versus investing in the long term. Can you compare this past quarter and the first quarter's investment in long term versus short term, or sort of mail-oriented volume, compared to where you might have been in pre-recession levels?\nDaniel Henry: So certainly last year, when marketing was way down, we were focused on the near term. And now that we have the ability to invest more broadly, we'd be more inclined to have a greater percentage, clearly in the moderate to long term. If I contrasted to '07, I would say we probably have more investments in this quarter that are focused on the medium to long term than you would\u2019ve had back in '07 when the investment models were up [ph].\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets: And then in the U.S. Card segment itself, the rebound in average cardholder spending, how much of that rebound do you think is led by virtue of the fact that, I'm guessing, that the mix of revenue is much more skewed towards your affinity in co-branded relationships now than it was prior to the recession? So is it possible for us to see that average spend per customer going higher because of the mix today versus before? Or pretty much as your portfolio, now we're back at pre-recession levels, should we start to think about that level, what kind of smoothing out and then the growth coming from organic account growth?\nDaniel Henry: So I think to the extent we execute against our strategy of focusing on charge and co-brand, those customers tend to spend at a higher level. So it should be a positive effect on revenues over time. In this quarter, I think it's a combination of that shift in strategy as well as just customer behavior, where they've gone from a point where they pulled back on their spending last year; they're bringing their spending levels back up. So I think both those factors were important in terms of the increases that we saw in the second quarter. So let's just have one last question.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think of unemployment as it applies to spending? Meaning, Discover made a comment a month ago, or maybe a little longer, that it's best to think of that base of unemployed Americans, whether it\u2019s callous to say or not, as not impactful on the business at this point, and to take them out of your future thought process. So I just wanted to get your take on that?\nRon Stovall: So I don't really know the basis of their observation, but certainly, over time, it's important for us to have job creation. Job creation, I think, is a very important thing that drives spend. It probably also impacts consumer confidence, which is an important part of what drives GDP, which is important to our business. So I don't know the intricacies of what part of unemployment is affecting our business, but over the long term, we need a healthy economy. We need the unemployment rate to come back down. And we need job creation to have greater certainty in the economy and have economic growth.\nRon Stovall: All right, thanks everybody for joining the call. And have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ron Stovall. Please go ahead, Sir. \nRon Stovall:  Thank you and welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s discussion.  As usual, it is my responsibility to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s press release which was filed in an 8K report and in the company\u2019s 2009 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the first quarter 2010 earnings release and earning supplement on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.AmericanExpress.com. We have provided information that describes the company\u2019s managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion.   Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period where Dan will be available to respond to your questions.  Up until then, no one has actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan. \nDaniel Henry: Thanks Ron. Let\u2019s look at slide 2, summary of financial performance. If you look half way down the slide you can see diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.73 compared to $0.32 last year, up 128%. That was driven by strong billed business and improved credit performance.  A number of line items impacted by the adoption of accounting rule ASU 2009 16-17 formerly known as FAS 166 or 167. The rule requires that securitized loans be brought back onto the balance sheet and the related revenue and expense go back to their natural lines. We have not restated 2009. For better apples-to-apples comparisons I recommend you compare the 2010 to the 2009 managed results.  At the top of the slide you can see revenue on that basis was down 1%. If we adjusted for FX it is down 4% as better discount revenue from billed business is offset by lower net spread. The difference on the growth rate that you see on continuing operations which is up 100% compared to the EPS growth of 128% is driven by the fact we had preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2009 and as you know we repaid that preferred stock in June of last year.  If we move over to slide 3, here we are going to show the impact of the new accounting rule on our balance sheet. We recorded $29 billion of loans that were previously securities and off balance sheet. We have a related credit reserve on these loans of $2.5 billion and that was established through equity, not the P&L. At the bottom of the slide you can see the after-tax impact of that reserve, $1.8 billion. Now investment securities are the B, C and D trenches for certain securitizations. Historically we would sell all of the securitized receivables but starting in the third quarter of 2007 because of the wide spreads we held onto certain of the trenches. Those are now simply part of the loan balance.  Other receivables represents restricted cash. When S&P reduced our rating the trust agreements required that we hold assigned cash related to debt that would mature in the near future, that now is moving from other receivables to other assets. When we get to slide 12 I will talk about some of the impacts of the new rule on those line items. So while this is something of a nuisance comparing 2010 to 2009 in the long-term it is a good change because the new rules provide a clear depiction of our financial results.  So let\u2019s move to slide 4 and look at billed business. You can see here it has increased 16%, 12% on an FX adjusted basis. Significantly better than our other major competitors. This clearly demonstrates we have a differentiated business model reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products which are focused on spending. You can see cards in force are down 4%. If we exclude the inactive cards we cancelled last year it is down 1%.  We can see average spend was a major driver of billed business growth. On an FX adjusted basis it is up 20% and as we also factor out those inactive cards it is about 14%. When we look at card loans I recommend you look at total portfolio. You can see it is down 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an FX adjusted basis. This is in part driven by the credit actions we have taken and in part by customers de-leveraging just as we have seen across the entire industry.  Travel sales are strong, both business travel and consumer travel. It reflects higher ticket prices and higher number of transactions. It also reflects customers moving from the back of the plane to the front of the plane and people taking longer flights.  If we move to slide 5 this is more detail on billed business. Each of the bars represent a dollar amount of billed business in each month. The yellow and blue lines reflect the year-over-year growth on a reported and FX adjusted basis. If you look at the top it is a summary of what the quarterly change in billings were over the last several quarters and you can see the first quarter of 2010 is [negatively] better than the first quarter of 2009 and they are both depicted as green bars in this chart.  The growth rate is significantly higher and the absolute dollars are higher. I recognize the growth rate in the first quarter of 2010 is higher in part because of the easy grow over. 2009\u2019s first quarter was certainly our weakest billings quarter. As we look over the remaining quarters of 2010 the growth rates will be harder due to the fact we had higher billings later in 2009. That said March was the highest billings for any March in our history, slightly higher than March of 2008.  Let me move to slide 6. Here we are looking at worldwide network spend. You can see transaction size and the number of transactions are both contributing to the higher spend. Number of transactions increased by 7% and transaction size also increased by 7% for a combined billed business growth of 16%.  If we move to slide 7 we can see that billed business is growing across all of our businesses. The sharpest increase is in commercial services which is up 18% on an FX adjusted basis G&S continues to be very strong with growth of 25% on an FX adjusted basis. Global consumer businesses also are showing strong growth. If we look at this internationally, Asia and Latin America were somewhat stronger but we also had good growth in Canada and Europe.  If we move to slide 8, here we are showing you information for the U.S. consumer segment by product and we are showing it to you by quarter. You can see here we are getting the results based on the strategy we are deploying. We are focusing on driving charge card spend and premium lending which comes in the form of co-brand. This is where we are making our investments. You can see the U.S. consumer charge growth is up about 8%, co-brand is up 16% and proprietary lending is down 1%.  If we move to slide 9 this is charge card. It is showing you both billed business growth and the change in accounts receivable to charge card. You can see that billings and receivable growth continue to move in tandem. Total charge card growth for the total company is up 15% so that includes both consumer and corporate cards globally.  If we move to slide 10 we are looking at lending billed business and loan growth. Here, spending on lending products and loan growth are no longer correlated. Spending on lending products grew 11% while loans were down 11%. This is in part due to actions we have taken but also to consumers de-leveraging. Some of what is impacting this is we have reduced certain lines to certain customers. We have had lower lending card acquisition, there has been a significant reduction in balance transfers, the mix of the portfolio is changing to have a greater proportion of co-brand products.  If you look at our lending trench you can see payment rates are up. In March of 2009 the payment rate was 22.8% and in March of 2010 it is 26.9%. So a notable increase. We are seeing lower revolve levels and fewer cardmembers are making minimum payments. So we are seeing loan balances shrink as consumers de-lever and this is consistent with the industry trend but what differentiates us from the competition is they are seeing either low single digit growth or negative growth and we are seeing robust spending growth because we have a larger percent of transactors in our portfolio.  If we move to slide 11 this is our net interest yield. Here we have made some slight modifications to how we allocate interest among segments to make it simpler and more transparent for the business units and we have adjusted the yield calculation for each period on this slide. The change ranged from no change to about 30 basis points.  So you can see that in the first quarter of 2009 the yield was 10.9% and in the first quarter of 2010 it is 10%. The driver of this was reduction in interest rates with certain customers that are in our Care program as well as a change in customer behavior when you have lower revolve rates. We also had the impact of the Card Act but that was offset by pricing increases we put in place. As we have previously discussed over the balance of 2010 we expect the yield to return to historic levels of about 9%.  If we move to slide 12 this is our revenue performance. At the top you can see that discount revenue of 13% growth is a combination of growth in billed business up 16% and our discount rate dropping by one basis point to 2.55. So the discount rate continues to hold up well. Card fees are relatively consistent with last year. Net interest income I would look at on a managed basis and it is down 24%. That is both a combination of the drop in yield we just discussed and the fact that loans are down 11%. You can see we no longer have securitization income as these are all back on the natural line items.  Travel, commission and fees are being driven by the higher volumes I discussed before and if we look at other revenues on a reported basis we have increases related to the inclusion of loans and some of the fees related to those loans such as FX conversion fees. We also have higher G&S revenues and that is partially offset by lower assessment fees and the fact the GE portfolio which last year was on this line is now on the natural lines.  If you move to slide 13, the provision for losses, the improvement in charge card reflects lower write off rtes year-over-year, a notable improvement in the 30 day past due rates year-over-year and the fact we released approximately $50 million of reserves based on our credit performance. The improvement in cardmember lending provision is a result of lower write off rates and lower loans, therefore we have lower write off dollars.  We have lower reserve requirements based on the improved credit metrics and we released $500 million of reserves in this quarter. I would note the 2010 first quarter numbers includes write offs related to the loans that were securitized last year. Last year you don\u2019t have the write offs related to those loans. This improvement in provision is providing significant resources a portion of which is flowing to net income and a portion of which is being used to increase investments to drive growth in the medium to long term. I will have a number of additional slides on provision a little later.  Let\u2019s move to slide 14 and look at expense performance. You can see that marketing and promotion reflects the investments I just discussed before and are designed to drive future growth. I will talk a little bit more about that on the next slide. You can see cardmember rewards is up 43% and that is a combination of rewards related to our co-brand products as well as membership rewards. Co-brand volumes are up 16% and our cost per point is up slightly based on new co-brand agreements we have signed over the past year so the total increase in co-brand rewards is 24%.  Membership rewards\u2019 growth rate is being impacted by the fact that last year we made some refinements to the calculation that actually had a benefit in 2009 and therefore we have a grow-over this year. In addition to that URR is somewhat higher. That is being impacted by the fact that we continue to improve the value proposition and [haven\u2019t] made it easier for our cardmembers to redeem. It is also being impacted by the fact our cardmembers are more tenured as we have had lower levels of acquisition and more tenured cardmembers tend to have higher estimates for ultimate redemption.  In addition to that our cost per point is slightly higher. In 2009 customers utilized air as a redemption item to a lesser degree. Air is a higher cost redemption item and customers are moving back to normal levels of utilization of air as an option. The important thing here is long-term rewards are an important part of our value proposition and we believe we have the ability to properly manage these costs and have products that have very good economics.  Next let me look at salaries and employee benefits which are up 6%. This is being driven by higher incentive compensation, some impact from FX, severance costs in the quarter related to some re-engineering done within our global commercial services segment partially offset by lower employee level. Employee level is about 5,000 lower than last year and that is a result of the re-engineering that we did last year.  Other operating expenses reflect spending of certain costs that are driving growth such as technology spending but those expenses that are not driving growth in revenues are being very well controlled and I have a slide a little later on that.  So if we move to slide 15 and look at marketing and promotion expense, each of these bars is the dollar amount of marketing and promotion for each of the prospective quarters. The green bars reflect the first quarter of 2008, 2009 and 2010. You can see the 2010 spending is significantly higher than the amount we did in the first quarter of 2009. In that period we were pulling back on marketing so we could stay profitable. We can see that the first quarter of 2010 is back to the level we had in first quarter 2008 and represents healthy spending levels in U.S. consumer, International Consumer as well as G&S.  The increases are broad. They include spending on brand advertising. Last year we were basically dark in brand advertising so we brought back brand advertising. It also reflects spending on acquisitions. We note our acquisitions are focused on the affluent customer and therefore the number of accounts we are acquiring even though we are spending more on acquisition is similar to the number of accounts we acquired last year.  We are also spending on loyalty and you can see the benefit of that in our average spend numbers. We are also continuing to invest in merchant programs and with our G&S partners.  If we move to slide 16 this is a chart on operating expense. As we have indicated, investments are not just in marketing and promotion but also some are in operating expense and this chart is intended to give you an idea of how it splits out. On the chart you can see growth is about 8%. It is actually 4% on an FX adjusted basis. So the circles that are above the line are growing faster than the average and the circles below the line are growing smaller than the average. So we are trying to use color codes to give you an indication whether it is a large item, medium in size or small. Certain of these circles as we go forward will be on the chart each quarter and others will be on the chart when they are relevant.  So the areas where we are spending above average are on partner investments such as marketing initiatives with Delta would be an example. We also continue to invest in global network services and that is marketing related to partners who issued cards that were on our network. We also are spending on technology to enable our growth initiatives. FDIC assessments while small is an indication of the type of item that is actually going above the average on this line.  On the other hand collections because write off rates are down is below the average and as you can see staff functions such as finance, HR and general counsel are growing slower than the average as is global services group which is led by Steve Squeri and as you know we pulled this group together which is focused on improving quality and also very focused one efficiency. I would note we continue to plan over the balance of this year to continue to invest at healthy levels in both marketing and promotion and in operating expenses that will drive growth.  So let me move to slide 17 which is the U.S. charge card net write off rate and 30 day past due chart. You can see that charge card continues to perform very well. Write off rates in the 30 day past due rate are now at historic lows. Actually in all likelihood over time these rates will actually probably move up more towards historic levels over time.  If we move to slide 18 this relates to international consumer and global commercial charge cards and the net loss rate and 90 day past due bills ratio. First let me mention for these two segments we have moved the write offs from 130 days to 180 days to comply with banking regulatory guidelines. You may remember we made this change in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. This has no impact on provision because the AR after 180 days is effectively fully reserves but the write offs do run through the net loss ratio calculation in this quarter and that piece is depicted by the dark blue section of this bar.  So write offs excluding the write offs between 180 and 360 was 13 basis points. Another change we made relates to fraud losses. Historically fraud losses have been included in this bar but starting in this quarter they are being excluded. That is probably about three basis points. So the apples-to-apples comparison to last quarter 22 basis points would be the 13 basis points plus the three basis points for fraud, or 16 basis points. On an apples-to-apples comparison you can see it is improving.  I would also note the 90 day past billings ratio is lower in part because of improved credit but also by the fact we made this change to write off those receivables that were between 180 and 360.  Moving to slide 19 this is charge card reserve coverage. While credit has improved we remain cautious in our reserving. The coverage of the 30 day past due for the U.S. consumer card is similar to what we had last year. International consumer and global commercial services the 90 day past billing coverage has increased as you can see on this chart and that is because we modified our reserving methodology to move to a methodology that is based on losses to billed business ratios. As those losses continue to improve this coverage ratio will move back to historic levels.  Let me move to slide 20. This is the lending net write off rate. So last quarter we forecasted the USCS write off rate would be flat with the fourth quarter of 5.7%. In fact it has come in slightly better at 7.2% and this is due to lower bankruptcy dollars. It is a combination of fewer filings and lower dollars per filing. We continue to significantly outperform the industry. Improved credit is a significant source of funding for higher earnings and higher investment levels.  If we move to slide 21 this is the lending 30 day past due chart and you can see we continue to improve in the U.S. and are stable in the international consumer markets.  If we move to slide 22 this is a chart we have used over the last several quarters. If the 30 day past due to write off rate remains stable, that is the bottom part of this chart, and bankruptcies and recoveries remain stable then improvements on the right hand side of this chart, improvements in the current to 30 day past due will flow to the bottom line with improved write offs.  In that upper left chart the yellow triangles are what wrote off in the first quarter. Those three triangles are pretty similar to the green triangles preceding that and that is why we forecasted the first quarter would be similar to the fourth quarter. As I said before the reason for better performance in the first quarter was really driven by the right side of this chart which is we had lower bankruptcy filings.  If we go back to the upper left hand chart and look at the green triangles we can see they are improving and therefore we would expect the second quarter write offs to be better or lower than the write off rate we saw in the first quarter of 2010. That is also consistent with what we said at the end of the first quarter.  So moving to slide 23, we wanted to provide you with some information regarding lending reserve levels. If we start at the left side of this chart, starting at the end of 2008 and during 2009 we had write offs of approximately $1 billion. We had a provision of $1.4 billion. So we built reserves during this period by $400 million and that reflects the deterioration in delinquencies and the higher write off rates we were seeing in 2009.  If you move to the right side of that chart we start at the end of 2009 and the first bar reflects the reserves we established related to the loans we brought back on balance sheet. I will remind you that ran through equity, not through the P&L. During this year we had write offs of $1.2 billion and a provision of $700 million so we effectively released $500 million in reserves and that reflects improving delinquencies, lower write off rates and lower loan balances.  With improved credit metrics you would expect the red bar or the write offs in this year to be lower than the write offs we had last year. But the difference as we are showing in the little box in the upper right of the chart is this year we have write offs related to both the on balance sheet loans as well as the loans that came back on the balance sheet which were off balance sheet last year and therefore there were no write offs related to that. The comparable is that the $700 million related to non-securitized loans compared to the $1 billion so we actually saw a decrease in write offs on an apples-to-apples basis which you would expect.  If we move to slide 24 this is our reserve coverage. Credit metrics, both write offs and past due, continue to improve. We reduced reserves by $500 million based on the inherent risk in the portfolio and the lower loan balances but we continue to be cautious due to the uncertain economic environment and you can see our reserve coverage, reserves as a percentage of past due and principle month\u2019s coverage reflect our cautious outlook.  If we move to slide 25 these are our capital ratios. Capital ratios remain above well capitalized levels. Tier 1 common ratio relative to other financial institutions are strong and we need to wait to see where the regulators actually set the benchmark. Again, on a comparative basis our Tier 1 common compared to other financial institutions is strong.  If we move to slide 26 this is a liquidity snapshot. You can see we have excess cash and marketable securities of $27 billion. The next 12 months of maturities is $20 billion so we continue to hold cash and marketable securities equal to or greater the next 12 months of maturities.  If we move to slide 27 this is retail deposits. We continue to build deposits. We now have $27.4 billion of deposits. If you look below the chart we have made some additional disclosures here. If you start at the very bottom you can see the average rate at issuance which is 2.3%. Also right above that you can see the weighted average maturity when the deposits were originally put on the books. That is 31 months. We think also a relevant disclosure is the weighted average remaining maturities so we have provided this additional information and we hope you find it useful.  With that let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the improved economic environment and our shift to a more offensive posture versus last year\u2019s defensive stance. Spending has rebounded across all business sectors with monthly comparisons improving due to both easier comparisons versus last year and higher absolute spending levels. We also show a sharp divergence between customer spending and borrowing levels. Some of it is due to our strategic and risk related actions and some reflects changes in customer behavior.  While these offsetting influences, stronger billings growth and lower loan balances challenged overall revenue growth, credit trends continue to provide lower provision requirements and our underlying operating expense growth remains well controlled. This quarter is a clear demonstration of our differentiated business model reflecting the makeup of our customer base and the design of our products. Spending on our network increased well above industry average while loans decreased and credit performance was among the best in major card issuers.  Our decisive and effective credit actions achieved improved credit performance without stifling spend by credit worthy cardmembers. The net effect of all these factors is our ability to invest in the business at significant levels while also generating strong earnings. While some investments are designed to drive metrics over the next 12 months we are also allocating resources to initiatives focused on the medium to long-term success of the company.  Challenges to continued progress remain. Unemployment levels are still high and customer behavior as well as the legislative environment are uncertain. However, the global economy seems to be poised to continue to improve and our strong competitive position is yielding high quality comparisons versus the competition. This gives us confidence our investments and our differentiated business model are appropriately positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.  Thanks for listening. We are now ready to take questions.  \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein. \nJohn McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: On the billed business did the strong March trend has that so far pulled through to April?  \nDaniel Henry :  The results we are seeing in April are similar to what we saw in March. \nJohn McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: On a simplistic level I think some people look at the numbers and when you talk about March being the highest ever they say how can that be? More people are unemployed. Companies seem to be spending less. Your numbers of cards are down. How is it that the billed business is at the highest March ever? \nDaniel Henry :  I think our cardmember base doesn\u2019t reflect the general population. I think our products are designed to meet the needs of higher spending, more affluent customers. Last year when we saw the drop in billings in the first three quarters of last year when our billings were dropping at a rate similar to the competition we were actually relatively pleased by that because generally discretionary spending drops at a faster rate and our customers have more discretionary spending than the average population.  I think what we see here is when things improve that discretionary spending is coming back. I think it is really the impact of a more affluent customer base. I think that is one part of it. The next part has to do with corporate card. Corporate card generally is more of a V. It goes down sharper than the rest of spending and it comes back a lot steeper and I think we are seeing that make a strong contribution here. We have a very strong position in corporate card.  Thirdly we have a strong G&S business. As you can see from the charts spending on cards issued by our partners that run on our network is performing very well. I think it is all of those factors which are contributing to the billings growth which is significantly higher than we are seeing among other major competitors. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: Could you just quantify the severance you paid in the quarter? \nDaniel Henry :  It was the bulk of the re-engineering charge you can see in the supplement. It is about $16 million. \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: When you look at your reserve is a good way to think about that over time you will normalize to about 12 month\u2019s coverage of charge offs? That seems to be what a lot of the industry is talking about. \nDaniel Henry :  We don\u2019t set our reserves based on month\u2019s coverage. We actually have models we utilize that look at historical performance which is really the basis for the bulk of our reserve. We also look at whether there is a need for specific reserves for certain areas. For instance, we have done re-aging recently. Those re-aged accounts have greater credit risk than the overall portfolio so we set up some specific reserves for those. Then we also take into consideration what is taking place in the economy. Is it uncertain? Is it stable? We use that process to actually establish our reserves. We then take a look a whole variety of metrics including loans coverage, including the percentage of reserves compared to the total loan balances, reserves as a percentage of delinquencies, what level of new cards we put onto the books. There is a myriad of other factors that come into play. That is the way we set reserves. We don\u2019t do it off of any single metric. At the end of the day the reserves will be based on the inherent risk in the portfolio.  \nCraig Maurer \u2013 Calyon Securities (USA), Inc.: I know you commented on April versus March but have you seen any perceptible impact on your billings from the disruption in travel in Europe? \nDaniel Henry :  As it relates to the situation in Europe our main focus is really on meeting the needs of our customers and helping them to adjust their travel plans. Our call volume has increased eight fold during this period. That is where our focus is. There may be some minor impact to billings. Assuming there isn\u2019t further impact from more activity from the volcano we would estimate the impact from this is not going to be significant but it is too early to tell. There could be some changes in status as we go forward and that could have an impact. Where we stand today our focus is on servicing our customers and we don\u2019t think the impact as facts are today would be significant. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : On the spending you indicated a couple of times that you have kind of three prongs to the investment spend approach. 12 month return, medium term and long term. Could you just give us a spend is going into each of those buckets and the kinds of returns you are expecting from them? I am assuming the page 16 you provided could also be identified that way as well. \nDaniel Henry :  I think page 16 we are trying to just give a little more information so we are a little bit clearer about the fact that investments don\u2019t just mean marketing and promotion but really spills over to other areas. So we really haven\u2019t broken out historically the dollar amounts in each of these categories but you do get some sense for what is in certainly marketing and promotion; a very clear look there. The actual percentage of total operating expense that OpEx is not the overwhelming majority. Let\u2019s face it you need to have a fair amount of that operating expense supporting our core business but we are allocating more to that because we are emphasizing commercial card if we are going to grow commercial card it is generally related to sales force. That would be in operating expense.  We are also very focused on new fee generation and new products that would drive fee revenue growth. We have talked about loyalty as an example of that. We have talked about marketing data to merchants and all of those require OpEx to drive it. We haven\u2019t split up that number exactly but it is not inconsequential but it is not the vast majority. \nBetsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Can you give us a sense as to how the return on investment spend you have been doing over the last year has tracked relative to plan? The question that is related to your comment you did allow some of the credit losses to fall to the bottom line this quarter. I am just wondering if the investment spend is maxed out or if you are just waiting for some of those returns to fall through before reinvesting some of those credit loss improvement initiatives. \nDaniel Henry :  I think that the investments we are making in the tried and true things that we have historically done that are part of our core business as you can see over the years our returns on those are very good. We think the investments we are making this year in those core businesses will also be very good and very much along historic levels. Any time you venture into new areas some of which we are doing you have estimated returns and those estimated returns will give us actually very good economics. The certainty of those are obviously different because you don\u2019t have history to know if you will be successful in achieving those.  In any event the assumptions we have made will give us very good returns. The way we think about what portion is flowing to the bottom line and what portion we are investing is driven by the fact we want to ensure we are investing enough to drive growth in the future that will enable us to hit our financial targets.  If you look back at the 2005 to 2008 timeframe and took marketing and promotion plus investments that drive growth within operating expense those two numbers would probably be about 13% of revenues. We have actually taken that up to about 14-15% in the current period. So we are investing at a slightly higher level than we did historically. Again we are trying to balance where our income level should be and investing to drive future growth in the years to come. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs. \nBrian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs : On the card margin at 10% this quarter I guess both you and Capital One had much better card margins at least than I had modeled off of the first quarter. What is the timing mechanism and why did it hold up better in the quarter that the Card Act went live but then ratchets down in your guidance to the 9-ish percent level over the next couple of quarters? \nDaniel Henry :  I think the Card Act was only in effect for a portion of the quarter and there is another piece of the Card Act that comes into effect in August. I don\u2019t think we have seen the full impact of the Card Act yet. I don\u2019t think we will see that until we get to the fourth quarter and that is why it kind of ramps down over the course of the year. \nBrian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs : At your analyst day you gave some helpful slides on the composition of the spend recovery; things like jewelry and cruise sales that kind of pointed to the high end recovery we are now seeing in the quarter. Are there any other pockets of notable strength right now as you look at the March results by category? Both curiosity in where it is coming from but also is it still the high end, less indebted consumer that is driving the spending recovery or is some of the rest of the book contributing as well? \nDaniel Henry :  You are really seeing honestly all of our businesses contribute to the growth. You can look at that chart by segment and you can see that it is G&S, commercial card, it is in the U.S. and it is in international. It really is broad based across all of those. It is our view we think it does have a lot to do with these discretionary pieces where we are seeing the biggest bounce back. That was true based on the information we showed at the financial community meeting. I would think that continues to be a driving force. \nBrian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  But it is still more the discretionary high end bucket you are seeing the best strength in? \nDaniel Henry:  Again, I think there are many factors contributing but that is among them. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Robert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: The cardmember rewards percentage of discount revenue and the growth rate is there some of your marketing strategies or promotions built into that which over time would pull back or are we looking at a level relative to the discount revenue that permanently is going to be at a higher level? \nDaniel Henry :  I think bonusing of rewards points is a part of that. That is decision we make every quarter. I think there were a number of unique things in this quarter which all contributed when you add it up. As I said in the first quarter of last year we had a refinement that actually was a benefit then. That creates a grow over. I think we have the impact of as I said less acquisition so therefore you have a more tenured base which is having an impact. Some of those will continue over time. The fact we have made the program have more options and increased the ease of redemption that would be a permanent increase.  Quite frankly to the extent customers actually redeem we view that as a very positive thing because if customers are engaged we see them spend more. If over time the URR were to drift up some we would view that as a positive, not as a negative. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: On page 22 you do a nice job of giving us some information on the direction of charge offs. That green line is a pretty steep decline from the yellow bars that drove charge offs in this quarter. Given it is that steep are you looking at charge offs to drop into the 5% range? Looking at that if you can give any guidance on levels of improvement you expect? \nDaniel Henry :  We designed this chart to try and be helpful without doing a forecast. I don\u2019t want to do a forecast. We are trying to give you all of the pieces so you can think about where we are going directionally. I wouldn\u2019t want to go beyond that. \nRobert Napoli \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Can you give any outlook or update on Revolution Money and what you have done to date, how you feel about that business. It has been several months since you announced the deal and kind of where the key focus is for that business. \nDaniel Henry :  We closed that transaction in January so it is just about three months. I think as we talked about at the time we were basically buying a platform and so we are in the process of developing exactly what our strategy will be but we think it will help us in the area of alternative payments. I don\u2019t have a lot more to add to that. Over time as it develops we will share that with you. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: I am sorry, I have to beat a dead horse here. If you look at spending and I want to just drag down to U.S. spending for your comments you made about March being the best March ever, collectively though it was a quarter that wasn\u2019t one of your strongest quarters in terms of spending if you look at 2007 and 2008. Worse than most quarters in 2009 and then sort of closer to 2006 levels. Did something happen in January and February that spending was very depressed and then all of a sudden it surged in March and is continuing [in August]? I just want a clarification. \nDaniel Henry :  I think the spending levels you see in January and February we are seasonally down as they always are after December. January and February were not record months but they did show strong growth; growth that wasn\u2019t dissimilar to what we saw in December. But March picked up to a higher growth level than we saw in each of those. As a quarter it is not the highest quarter ever. I was trying to create some balance here. I was trying to point out that the grow overs as we go into the next three quarters are going to be more difficult because spending did improve last year. I didn\u2019t want to be too downbeat so I wanted to point out March was notwithstanding that the best month. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: We are not looking at spending in the go go days of 2007 and 2008? A return to that quickly? \nDaniel Henry :  March is higher than 2008 which previously had been the highest March ever. So March is slightly above March of 2008. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: Now that TALF is officially over and you didn\u2019t access TALF in the fourth quarter. Even since the third quarter. What is your outlook on the securitization market and overall funding? \nDaniel Henry :  Securitization market I think is going to be important to the whole industry over time. I think the fact that all of the major issuers really stood behind their trust in 2009 should bode well for its ability to come back as an important funding source. Right now we are really using deposits as the main area we are growing to fund our needs. I would point out this month we did sell one B trench we had previously held and the reason we did that was because spreads had come back in to a level we thought was appropriate to sell.  I think spreads have come in quite a bit both on that B trench as well as generally our spreads have come in very nicely. I think it may take some time but I don\u2019t see any reason why securitizations in the future would be a good funding source not only for American Express but for the Industry. I am talking about credit card securitizations. \nMeredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisors: Is that a 2010 or 2011 phenomenon do you think? \nDaniel Henry :  I don\u2019t know. Right now with folks\u2019 balance sheets shrinking the need to move back into that market quickly is being diminished a little bit. You generally need to increase your funding to the extent your balance sheet is growing on the left hand side. So I guess it would be a moderate process. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Christopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.\nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: Can you give us an update on your view of the success of your charge card marketing campaign? [Inaudible] I was hoping you could give us some color. \nDaniel Henry :  I think we are seeing I think charge card in total in the company grew 15%. That is a combination of both consumer and corporate. So that is actually very strong growth I think when you are looking at the total. If we were to look at the slide which is just U.S. consumer charge card growth for U.S. consumer is up 8%. Both of those are pretty healthy growth rates and I think reflective of not only the marketing we are doing in this corner but quite frankly the strength of this franchise and the fact those are customers that have the capacity to spend. So I think that is all really very positive. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: On how the response rate to\u2026there seems to be a lot of TV advertising in that campaign. I am not sure how much mail is being sent out. They are a tough customer to crack in terms of high acquisition costs there. Are consumers entering responses to this campaign? Any metrics on the account growth you could give me? \nDaniel Henry :  I think as we all know response rates over many years have declined. I don\u2019t think we are seeing response rate that are dramatically different than recent history. I would say we are focusing on charge card and premium lending. As you know to acquire those customers are more costly than to acquire customers that have lower spend. So while we have ratcheted up the dollars we are spending on acquisition the actual number of accounts we are acquiring this year are similar to the number of accounts we acquired in the first quarter of last year. That is a reflection more of who we are going after as opposed to a notable reduction in response rates. So to acquire the affluent is more costly but based on our modeling we believe we will have very good economics on those customers. \nChristopher Brendler \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: On the rewards expense, it was up a lot and you cited some factors. I would think you would have a little more pricing power just given where you are in the cycle to drive a lower cost per point rather than a higher cost per point. Can you give some additional color on what is going on there? \nDaniel Henry :  I think our rewards team has really over the last 5-6 years done an excellent job of both expanding the program to add many new options people can redeem for and at the same time create a mix that has really helped us to hold cost per point very constant over a 5-year period. We saw a little bit of a tick up and again that was because I was making a comparison year-over-year and last year you basically had probably a little bit of a benefit on cost per point because people weren\u2019t redeeming for air and in the mix that is the most expensive piece. I think the team continues to do a good job and I think we are optimistic that cost per point can be managed well while also providing a good value proposition for our customers. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities. \nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: Can you talk a little bit about the performance of the CARE program and how actively you are having to manage that? \nDaniel Henry :  We are managing it very actively and very closely. Our intent going in here was to work with customers who had temporary liquidity issues. The actions we took were intended to help them but also were economic actions. They were actions where we thought by working with the customer American Express over the long-term would get a better return than if we didn\u2019t have a plan with them. So we are tracking them very closely customer by customer. We are identifying which customers are not complying with the program and actually re-aging. Those customers that are performing well we are also moderating the reserve we have against them based on their performance. I also point out the program is not growing at this juncture as credit metrics actually are improving somewhat. \nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: Can you comment on your expectations for lending balances as we look throughout the rest of the year whether you expect them to continue to decrease or stabilize? \nDaniel Henry :  We haven\u2019t really given a forecast for the balance of the year. What I would say is probably over an 18 month period I would expect the growth rate in spending and the growth rate in loan balances to come closer back together. Part of that will depend on customer behavior and how much further they are going to de-lever so that will be a big part of it as well. \nBill Carcache \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities: On capital levels, your business generates more capital than you need and you are building up those capital levels very quickly. Of course you have talked about how you are waiting for guidance from regulators before you give ROE guidance and start considering the potential for being able to repurchase shares. If you were able to build those capital levels up let\u2019s say at some point would you consider even if you didn\u2019t get guidance from regulators yet just coming out and feeling comfortable giving what you expect ROE guidance will be and also potentially even announcing that you are going to do some repurchases? \nDaniel Henry :  I think we are committed, I am committed by the middle of this year to give some guidance on ROE. We will probably give some guidance on what percentage of earnings we will be looking to return to shareholders through either dividends or share repurchases. So as I say I think we will do that in the middle of the summer. It also requires a conversation with the regulators. There is another large financial institution that actually did some share repurchases this quarter after a conversation with the regulators. I think that will be an assessment we make later in this year. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of David Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research:  I wonder if you could revisit the expected decline in the net interest yield in USCS? How much of the Card Act affects the small business card? Are they exempt? \nDaniel Henry: The Card Act does not apply to the small business cards. We think our card agreements with small businesses are clear and transparent so we are very comfortable with our terms and conditions with small businesses. The Card Act does not apply to those cards. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Given the fact that you were less affected by the Card Act and have all the onerous elements going into effect last year, I guess I am still a little unclear on why you are going to have a 10% decline in the net interest yield because of the Card Act this year. \nDaniel Henry :  I think you have to go back a little further. If you go back to 2008 our yield was about 9%. In 2009 we put in pricing changes to increase the yield in anticipation of the Card Act coming into effect. The Card Act comes into effect in 2010 and we move back down to 9%. So it is really just getting back to historical levels. What we have said is we want to put pricing increases in place that would offset the impact of the Card Act and if we move back to 9% that is exactly what we would have achieved. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: So you lost any pricing flexibility you had on the consumer card so you are actually not worse off if you have the same yield and don\u2019t have the same tools here [inaudible]. \nDaniel Henry :  That I think would only be true if we fell below 9% as we go forward. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research: Can you give any color on slide 8 where you talked and showed that the increase in spending on programs and charge and proprietary lending? I guess part of the differential in growth rates is a function of the size of those businesses but is there also a difference in the kinds of spending or the kinds of merchants those customers are spending at? Is it all T&E growth? \nDaniel Henry :  The size of the portfolio wouldn\u2019t affect the growth rate. That is not\u2026.\nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research:  I meant the size of the card base and spending volumes. \nDaniel Henry :  I think the mix of our business between T&E and non-T&E I haven\u2019t really seen anything to indicate that has shifted. What I would say is the co-brand increase in part is being affected by the fact that we signed a new agreement with Delta and it has opened up a whole new set of customers that we really didn\u2019t have access to before that were part of the Northwest program. We have been investing heavily behind the Delta program as well as some other new co-brands as well as resigned co-brands. It is really that activity that is driving the co-brand spend up.  On charge card we are also investing there. That is very much in line with the strategy we articulated. I think we are getting good results from that spending. I think it is probably in areas that are more discretionary. I don\u2019t think we have seen a big shift. \nDavid Hochstim \u2013 Buckingham Research:  The spending per card that has been outstanding for a year or two would there be these kinds of differences or they would have more similar changes? \nDaniel Henry :  I haven\u2019t seen any data that would imply any major shift whether it is the more tenured customers who are doing it or newer customers. Again, everything I have seen shows that it is very broad based. It is not just one segment or one area that is carrying 16% growth in billed business. It is really all of the businesses, all of the products other than proprietary lending where we have not been investing behind. Other than that I think it is very broad based. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Donald Fandetti \u2013 Citi. \nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citi: As you think about for the alternative payments and online spend do you think American Express is behind the curve a bit on that movement compared to PayPal and some of these other initiatives? I guess my question is are you going to have to spend a significant amount more via acquisition like we are seeing out of Visa and some of the other networks? \nDaniel Henry :  We are keenly aware over time alternative payments are likely to play a bigger role in payment. That is why we want to be very focused to this area. That is part of the reason why we made the Revolution Money acquisition. Online payments certainly receives a significant amount of attention by our senior management team. So we are balancing between what we are investing in the core business but it is also one of the reasons we want to allocate resources to investments that are really over the medium to long-term.  When I said before we are focused on investments that drive metrics over the next 12 months those are our core business investments. We are allocating more money to those things like online payments, alternative payments, some of the new fee businesses. Those in all likelihood won\u2019t provide significant returns to us over the next 24-36 months but we think they are very important to maintain our growth trajectory as you look out beyond that. So we are very cognizant of that and looking to invest in at an appropriate level. \nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citi: Do you think\u2026should we assume there could be other sort of bolt-on Revolution Money type acquisitions that sort of position you over the next year or two? \nDaniel Henry :  I think the reason we have over the last two years talked about bolt-on acquisitions is for exactly that reason. To actually achieve our strategies in some of these areas it may be appropriate to do bolt-on acquisitions to actually achieve those strategies. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Brad Ball - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.\nBrad Ball - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.: You have addressed to some extent the impact on the margin from the Card Act. Could you talk about whether or not you expect an impact on non-interest income and whether the Card Act provisions that are becoming effective in mid-August do they have an impact to the appropriate and reasonable fees on your charge card business? Can you give us some sense as to how to scale that? \nDaniel Henry :  Certainly that is something we will have to pay attention to. Certainly there is an indication people will look at the pricing increases people have put in place to see that they continue to be justified. They are also going to look at fees for people who don\u2019t comply with terms and conditions. We believe those fees are reasonable we will only know the ultimate answer to that after someone comes in and takes a look. So we are not anticipating that will have a negative impact on charge card. Nor do we think those aspects will have a negative impact beyond what we see now on yield. \nBrad Ball - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.: But charge cards are captured as part of the Reg provisions? \nDaniel Henry :  Yes they are. \nBrad Ball - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.: You noted the bankruptcy impact on first quarter credit statistics. I think your policy is to charge off bankruptcies on notification. Is that right? If that is the case there was a spike in bankruptcy filings in March. Was that those numbers or would that show up in the April numbers? \nDaniel Henry :  We do write off when we are notified. The industry may have had a spike up in March but we did not. We actually had filings drop in our customer base. In addition to that the dollar amount in the filings has been decreasing which is a benefit. So we actually saw a drop down, not a spike up in the month of March. \nBrad Ball - Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.: So maybe a disconnect where your higher quality customer base there are fewer bankruptcies in March than the end of Q1? \nDaniel Henry :  That is a metric that is hard to forecast. It could pop up next month to where we were in February. It is one of those things that is hard to forecast. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: I thought the Macy\u2019s deal was an interesting one this particular quarter in private label. I was wondering if that deal kind of foreshadowed a broader entry into private label or if there was just opportunity there? \nDaniel Henry :  So I think we are always looking to see where there are good economic deals to shift spending onto our network. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a broad strategy in retail. On the other hand to the extent there is an opportunity that is beneficial to both the other party and ourselves and has the right value proposition for the customer we will pursue those. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Do you consider taking credit risk in retail? \nDaniel Henry :  Private label? Is that the question? \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: That is right. \nDaniel Henry :  I would say the answer to that is that it is not one of the strategies that we [like to do]. \nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: If we look at reserve coverage on a worldwide basis I think you are at over 16 months. Then if we tie that to the delinquency trends you show on those charts over the next six months it seems like charge offs could come down quite a bit. How should we think about reserve coverage on a go-forward basis? Should we expect it to increase? Would you grow into it? Or should we assume that coverage and the reserve levels could come down? \nDaniel Henry :  As I said before describing how we set reserves which is not off of any one particular metric. So I think our reserves are going to be impacted by what the credit metrics are, where write offs are going, where delinquencies are going, what the loan balances are, what our outlook is as it relates to the economy. All of those things will come into play in terms of where we set our reserves each quarter. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.\nScott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: On the membership rewards idea, ultimate redemption rate maybe that will improve slightly over time. It seems like it is reviewed annually or periodically and adjustments are made. Would you expect rewards expense to move up as the economy improves and you see more and more air type or travel type of redemptions taking place? Where are we relative to historic on those types of redemptions? \nDaniel Henry :  I would say as we look forward I would expect rewards costs to grow at a somewhat higher rate that volumes over the next several quarters because we signed some new co-brand deals and so when you get a full year under your belt you are going to see that in the results. Then we had some things that are short-term in nature that are affecting membership rewards. Those won\u2019t repeat themselves. To the extent URR continues to drift up a little bit that would cause rewards costs to be somewhat higher than volumes.  As I said before, it is an important part of our value proposition and we actually view people redeeming as a very good thing. It is another reflection of engagement and our data shows that when people redeem they tend to spend at higher levels in the future. \nScott Valentin \u2013 FBR Capital Markets: On page 15 which I appreciate you showing a historical graphic of marketing and promotion expense. It looks like 1Q10 is back to a more normalized level if we look at 1Q08. Should we interpret that as saying maybe we should look at 3Q and 2Q of 2007 and 2008 as being indicative of where spend could go? Or do you plan to really increase the marketing beyond those levels? \nDaniel Henry :  I didn\u2019t want to forecast the marketing and promotion lines. As I said before it is our intent as credit improves and it provides us with resources to balance dropping some of that to the bottom line but continuing to invest at healthy levels to drive the business. Some of that will come in marketing and promotions and some of that will be reflected in operating expense. We are very focused on investing for the proper growth trajectory as we go forward. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of John Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  \nJohn Stilmar \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : With regards to overall corporate expenses if we look at American Express excluding Visa and MasterCard the benefit you have garnered over the past couple of years and we trend your business back and we look at you like a payment processor where total expense is relative to revenues or non-credit expenses are related to revenues we get kind of an operating margin. This quarter itself was one of the lower operating margins we have had which is certainly okay if we are at the early part of a growth cycle. I guess the question is I am sure you probably have looked at your business in this way. How should we be thinking about that relative to sort of near-term expectations? We have comments of some lower revenues and continued investing at this part in the cycle is certainly understandable but at these kinds of operating expense levels are we to sort of expect them at these levels for the next couple of quarters and then potentially get operating leverage in years to come? How should we be putting that in context relative to where you have been historically? Because this quarter is one of the highest expense levels relative to revenues that we have had at least for the past couple of five years. \nDaniel Henry :  We are long-term very focused on the fact we have to have well controlled operating expense. That is why I tried to speak to this in terms of some operating expense we view as not driving revenues and we are really focused on controlling that very well. Quite frankly I think we have done a pretty good job of that historically. We are investing in some areas that fall to a greater degree in operating expense that may have not been the case in the past. We are just trying to make that distinction. We are not moving away from our historical financial targets to grow revenues at greater than 8% and achieve EPS growth of 12-15%. I think that is probably one way of answering your question.  So thanks everybody for joining the call. Have a good evening. \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay after 7 p.m. today until April 29, 2010 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.\nRick Petrino: Thank you. Welcome, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the fourth quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, thanks, Rick. So we will start on Slide 2, the Fourth Quarter Summary of Financial Performance. Total revenues net of interest expense were $7.7 billion, 7% growth on both a reported and FX basis. That compares to the third quarter where we had 9% growth reported and 6% FX adjusted. So down 200 basis points on a reported basis, but up 100 basis points on an FX-adjusted basis.  Net income is $1.2 billion, EPS is $1.01. That is up 15%. You might remember that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a reengineering charge, which was $74 million after tax. In the fourth quarter of this year, we also have reengineering, and that's $32 million on an after-tax basis. So if you were to back those out, EPS growth would be 11%. So return on equity was strong at 28%. You can see that our shares outstanding have decreased compared to last year, and that reflects our share buyback program.  Moving to Slide 3. Now this is a full year slide for 2011, and total revenues net of interest expense was $30 billion. That's up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. That's very favorable compared to most of the other issuing competitors. EPS was $4.09, up 22%. So that's strong performance well above our EPS target of 12% to 15% growth. Moving to Slide 4, which is back to the fourth quarter, and these are our metrics. Billed business was $219 million, that's a record level of billed business for us. The growth was 11%, both on a reported and FX basis. So that compares to 16% reported growth and 13% FX growth in the third quarter, so a slight decline in billed business growth from the third quarter, which is what we've seen across the industry. So cards-in-force are at $97 million, GNS cards grew at 18% and proprietary cards grew at 2%, so in total, 7% growth. Average basic cardmember spending grew 8%. So we continue to have a high level of customer engagement. Loan growth was 3%, generally better than the industry. And travel sales, growing at 5%, reflect both growth in our Corporate and Consumer Travel businesses. We move to Slide 5, again this is full year metrics. So we had billed business growth of $222 billion (sic) [$822 billion]. That's growth of 13% on an FX-adjusted basis, and this will result in us gaining share again in 2011. If you look at average cardmember spend for the year on FX-adjusted basis, it was 11%. So again, high level of cardmember engagement.  We move to Slide 6. This is Billed Business Growth by Region. So if you look at the yellow line, which is Latin America and Canada, growth was 13% down 100 basis points from the third quarter. The dark blue line is the U.S. and the green line is Asia, and they are both down about 200 basis points compared to the third quarter. So these 3 regions held up reasonably well. If you look at the lowest line, which is the light blue line, that's Europe, and there we had a decrease to 4% from the 8% growth we had in the third quarter. So the U.K., Germany and France all had growth in the mid-single digits. Italy, actually, had a slight decline. If we move to Slide 7, so this is Billed Business Growth by Segment, so total billed business growth is the purple line. And you can see that, on an FX-adjusted basis, it decreased from 13% in the third quarter to 11% in the fourth quarter. GNS is the yellow line with circles and that decreased from 23% growth to 17% growth. It's due in part to a decline in Europe, but it's primarily due to the U.S., where Macy's is now in the numbers for our full year. GCS or Global Corporate Services, the green triangles, declined from 14% to 11% growth. And the decline is slightly higher in Europe, but it's broad based globally. USCS, which is the blue diamonds, is down only 100 basis points from 12% to 11%. And ICS, International Consumer, the light blue squares, moved from 9% to 6% growth, primarily due to Asia and Europe.  Next, we move to Slide 8. So this is comparing lending billed business compared to managed loan growth. So loan balances continue to grow, up 3% compared to a year ago, but it grows at a much slower rate than the growth rate of spending on lending products as you can see from the chart. This reflects that consumers continue to be cautious about taking on credit card loans, and a change in our strategy to focus on premium lending. Transactors continue to be a larger percentage of our loan book, and the lending trust pay down rate in December was 30%.  Moving to Slide 9, Net Interest Yield. Now historically, we have just shown the U.S. yield, but here we're also showing the yield for International Card. So international loans represent 14% of loans as of December 31, 2011. Yields are in line with our previous guidance of yields being in the high 8% to 9% range. You can see that the U.S. yield is now reasonably stable. In international, we're seeing the impact of our premium lending strategy as we see a decline in revolve rates, more transactors and a change in bucket mix due to improved credit. Going forward, yields will continue to be influenced by credit quality, the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving and cost of funds.  Moving to Slide 10, Revenue Performance. Discount revenue reflects 11% growth in billed business, a slightly lower discount rate, 1 basis point lower than last year, the impact of the GNS billed business and higher contra revenues, including partner payments, and this brings the growth with discount revenue to 8%. Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force, 2%. Travel commissions and fees are up 9%, reflecting higher travel sales and higher supplier revenues. Other commissions and fees include revenues from Loyalty Partner, which was purchased in March of 2011. Offset by an accrual for late fees, the company expects to refund to certain charge card accounts.  Other revenues increased 20%, reflecting higher GNS partner royalty revenues and a contractual payment from a GNS partner. Net interest income is lower by 1%. In the U.S., it was up 2%, with loan growth of 4% up to $53.7 billion, with yield acquiring 20 basis points compared to last year. International was down 10%, loans decreased $400 million to $8.9 billion, and yields declined 140 basis points for the reasons I described a minute ago. All in, we had revenue growth of 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 6% FX growth in the third quarter. Not at our 8% target, but given the environment, good performance. Moving to Slide 11, Provision for Loans. Charge card provision was $237 million compared to $183 million last year. The write-off rate is up slightly as expected, as we grow the charge card business, and as a result, accounts receivables are up accordingly. Here, credit metrics continue to be at historic lows. The loan provision was $149 million compared to $37 million last year. So the reserve release this quarter was $300 million. That's $400 million less than last year. So that change would push up provision, increase it. However, the write-off rate this quarter was 2.3% compared to a write-off rate of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. So the write-off dollars in this quarter were $400 million, $300 million less than last year. So the lower reserve release pushed it up by $400 million, lower write-off dollars pushed it down $300 million, so a net increase of about $100 million. Again, here the credit metrics continue to be at historic lows. Next is Slide 12, which is Charge Card Credit Performance. So the write-off rates in the charge card portfolio have increased slightly, both sequentially and compared to last year, but remained at historical lows. The slight increase in charge card metrics align with the company's charge card strategic objectives for growing and expanding the business.  Slide 13, Lending Write-off Rate. So lending write-off rates continue to improve. These are also at historic lows. And these are the best write-off rates in the industry, and they reflect our high-quality risk capabilities, our affluent customer base and our focus on premium lending. Moving to Slide 14, so this is Lending 30 Days Past Due. In the U.S., you can see that the past due percentage are stabilizing, which is what you'd expect at some point. International continues to improve, and again these are industry-leading metrics.  If we move to Slide 15, so this chart is helpful as we look forward. On the right side we see bankruptcies continue to be lower than last year. I would remind you that about 2/3 of the bankruptcies are already written off when we are notified. Now the upper left-hand green triangles are the accounts that are rolling from current to 30 days past due. So the green triangles represent May, June and July, and they would write off in 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent or they'd write off in the fourth quarter of 2011. So looking at that upper left-hand chart, if you look at the next 3 blue triangles, they are slightly higher than the green triangles. So if the 30-day past due to write-off rate, which is the bottom chart, remain constant, then you'd expect the first quarter 2012 write-off rate would be either flat or up a tick. I'll also remind you that bankruptcies and recoveries affect the write-off rate. You can see the U.S. delinquencies are stabilizing.  Now as I've mentioned in prior quarters, our objective is not to manage our business in order to minimize write-offs. Going forward, we will continue to balance our risk profile with the company's strategic growth objectives, and over time, we do not expect the loss rate to stay at these historic low levels. Moving to Slide 16. Here you can see on the chart across the top are the lending reserve releases by quarter. Then the light blue bars are the write-off dollar amounts in each quarter and the dark bar is the provision, so basically, the write-off dollars less the reserve releases. You can see the write-off dollar, the light blue bars, are decreasing as write-offs have come down. Also, reserve releases are decreasing as the past due rate of improvement slows. So the reserve release, these reserve releases should diminish as we go forward. Slide 17 or our Lending Reserve Coverage. You can see that the credit metrics continue to improve. Reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past dues have come down both in the U.S. and worldwide. Although we released $300 million of reserves in the quarter, coverage remains at appropriate levels. Moving to Slide 18, so this is Expense Performance. So total expenses increased 1% or decreased 2% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement payment that we received in 2010, but not in the fourth quarter of 2011. And that compares to 10% FX adjusted growth in the third quarter.  So looking at marketing and promotion, this decreased to 12% from the high levels of spending that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010. But marketing is still 7% of revenues, which are the historic levels that we have been at and reflect an appropriate level of investment to drive business growth. Rewards increased 10% in line with spending on rewards products. There was a slight increase in Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate estimate in both the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2010, so it had no effect on the growth rate of rewards expense in the fourth quarter of this year, unlike the second and third quarter, when higher ultimate redemption rate growth caused high growth rates on the rewards line. Operating expense had a 0 growth. It actually decreased by 4% if you adjust for the MasterCard settlement. And this compares with 9% FX-adjusted growth in the third quarter. We provided guidance that we would slow growth in operating expense as we exited 2011, and we have. This demonstrates our ability to control operating expenses.  So let me give you a little bit more detail on operating expenses on Slide 19. So salaries and benefits are down 2%. So I remind you in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had severance costs related to reengineering initiatives of $113 million, compared to severance cost in the fourth quarter of this year of $26 million. If we excluded both these items, we'd have a growth rate of 4%, approximately what you'd expect. Professional services is 6% lower, reflecting lower consulting fees and lower technology expenses, the type of items that we can flex up and down. Occupancy increased 9% and includes costs associated with Loyalty Partners, as well as lease termination costs associated with the company's reengineering.  Adjusted Other, Net is adjusted to exclude Visa/MasterCard. So here, our interest rate hedges are functioning exactly as intended. However, accounting rules require us to mark the hedges. So there's no economics here, and over the life of the hedge, the marks will equal 0. But in this period, we had a benefit compared to last year. And we had a litigation-related reserve release, and these 2 items really create the variance compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. So if we move to Slide 20, this is year-over-year operating expense, and this is a view of operating expense over the past 8 quarters. You can see the increase in operating expense in the fourth quarter of 2010, which is in the middle of the chart, at $3.2 billion. So this was driven by some onetime costs, including the severance-related reengineering initiatives and some higher incentive compensation, but it also included increases in our ongoing investments.  You can see that the quarters in 2011 have been in $3 billion to $3.1 billion range. This reflects higher levels of investments than we had in 2010, including investments in internal sales force, initiatives related to the digitization of our business, greater third-party merchant sales force, costs related to Loyalty Partners, new business initiatives, including Serve, and technology development expenditures, all designed to drive business growth. We are at an investment level that enables us to drive business growth, and at the same time, we are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. Now when you think about 2012, you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011, as you can see on the chart.  So now I'll move to Slide 21. So this is expenses and the flexibility over time. Adjusted expenses are all expenses excluding provision, as well as the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments. Now we recognize that we are currently at elevated levels. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back toward historical levels in 2 ways. First, through revenue growth, and our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. You can see that we have started to make progress in the fourth quarter of this year. Slide 22, our Capital Ratios. You can see that Tier 1 common capital ratio remains at 12.3%. We generated approximately $700 million of capital net through net income plus employee plans, less our dividend and our share repurchases, while the risk-weighted assets have increased due to seasonal growth in loans and accounts receivable. Let me point out that year-over-year, the Tier 1 common ratio has increased from 11.1% at the end of last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011. So we continue to have strong capital ratios. Looking at Slide 23, so this chart provides history on share repurchases. For the full year 2011, we returned 56% of capital generated to shareholders. We only repurchased $350 million in the fourth quarter as the request we made in our CCAR filing with the Fed last January was a total repurchase for 2011 of $2.3 billion. Since acquisitions in 2011 were less than we planned and repurchases were capped at $2.3 billion, our Tier 1 common ratio increased from 11.1% last year to 12.3% at the end of 2011. We were mindful of this when we made our CCAR submission this year on January 9 and endeavored to create more flexibility. Moving to Slide 24, so this is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the 12 months of funding maturities over the next 12 months. So we hold $18 billion in excess cash and securities and the next 12 months of maturities is $14 billion. Slide 25, this is retail deposits. So we raised $4.8 billion in deposits in the quarter in part to fund seasonal needs, in part to replace maturing long-term debt. Direct deposits increased by $1.4 billion in the quarter, and over the course of 2011, we raised 6.7 indirect deposits. As we've discussed, deposits provide greater degrees of funding diversity for us.  Page 26 is some history on our ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimate of the range of potential issuances in 2012. We plan to continue to access the ABS and unsecured debt markets in addition to raising deposits as part of having a broad funding diversity. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results in the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters, as well as the realization of a planned slowdown in the growth of operating expenses. Spending growth remains strong, and we continue to grow well above the average rate of our large issuing competitors, despite difficult prior year comparisons and a challenging global economic environment. Certain regions internationally did show slowing growth, especially in Europe where growth slowed to 4%, though all regions continue to grow and overall buildings held up well in reaching our new record high. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year. Lending loss rates continue to improve. Loss rates in both the U.S. and international lending portfolios have reached all-time lows. Despite the continued improvement, provision expense did increase as reserve releases were lower this year and the prior year.  Our strong billings growth coupled with higher other noninterest revenues, drove solid revenue growth. Our revenue growth, which reflects the benefits of our spend-centric model, stands in contrast to many other issuers, who are still facing year-over-year revenue declines. In the fourth quarter, strong revenue growth was paired with significant reductions in the total expense growth rate to generate strong earnings. Despite the improvement in expense growth, we are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spend and growth in the card base, while enabling us to build capabilities for the future. We feel very good about the recent performance, but acknowledge that the global economic environment remains uncertain. Looking ahead, we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds and significant credit reserve releases. But we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. We are continuing to implement our plan to contain operating expenses as we head into 2012. And in the fourth quarter, we saw a clear evidence of our ability to do that. Going forward, we will continue to monitor spend trends around the world, but we are very pleased with our results. 2011 was a great year for American Express as we achieved record billing levels and record earnings, while facing the highly competitive environment and challenging economic backdrop.  So thanks for listening, and we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Obviously, a lot of what's going on in terms of spend is just a function of tougher and tougher year-over-year comps. But Dan, historically, one of the data points that you provided periodically was a stratification of spending trends by what you called wallet size or annual spend. Is there anything there that you can point to right now in terms of what's going on? Is there any difference between the high end and the low end at this point?\nDaniel T. Henry: So that's usually the type of information we provide at one of our semiannual conferences and don't provide it on a recurring basis. I guess what I would say is what we saw in the quarter where our growth was generally higher than most of the other competitors is a reflection of our business model, and we're only reaping the benefits of the investments that we've made over the past couple of years. While the growth rate did decline from the third quarter, I think we've seen that really across the industry. And the decline really was pretty spread out across the globe and really across most of our businesses. So it's kind of the -- what we're seeing, I think, is really a reflection of what's taking place in the economy. But at this point, we don't have other information to share in terms of changes that may be taking -- by different wallet size. As you know, when we had this decrease or recession, you saw the steepest reduction in people who had the highest spend because they had the greatest amount of discretionary spending. But we've seen those customers bounce back very nicely over the last 2 years, and they continue to have very high levels of engagement as you can see by the increases in the average spend of our cardmembers.\nRichard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'll cross my fingers that you guys put that out at investor day.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSteven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. Just a touch additionally on the spend trends. Just wondering, like, what was the trend that was seen during the quarter? Was it weaker throughout the quarter or did it get weaker during the quarter? And then if there's any updates on the first couple of weeks in January.\nDaniel T. Henry: I would say it was pretty even over the course of the quarter, kind of month by month. So it wasn't a situation where December was notably different than the spending growth rate for the quarter.\nSteven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Sure. And any updates on what we've seen month-to-date in January?\nDaniel T. Henry: Not at this point.\nSteven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I guess, another question is with regards to your longer-term targets and -- what are your thoughts about that for 2012 in an environment where it continues to remain slow growth economic environment?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, what we'll see actually next year, as you indicated in your question, will be dependent on where the economy goes. And we fully recognize that we have had very strong growth over the last 2 years, so the comparables will be more difficult, and there are some benefits that are not going to reoccur. As we think about this, we want to make good, smart investment decisions that are going to drive the growth of the business over the long term. And as we think about all of our targets, we think about them as on average and over time targets. We've always kind of addressed it that way and we'll continue to do the same as we go forward.\nSteven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Sure. And then final question, on the international yield side, do you think that the yields will remain kind of at the fourth quarter levels, or will it continue to decline from here?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so I think the change in yields that we've seen in international are a part of the focus on premium lending that we put in place. And that's what's really driving the yields down. To us, whether the yields in international stay exactly where they are or modulate from there, the important thing is one of the overall economics of the product focusing both on the spend that they have, the loan balance that they have, as well as the yield. In the U.S., we've kind of given guidance that we expect it to be kind of in this high 8% to 9% range, and you could see that we've stabilized in the U.S. at that level.\nOperator: We will go next to Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Question on Membership Rewards costs. We saw that actually grow a bit slower than the U.S. billed business growth rate. Just some thoughts there and how we should expect that to trend as I'm modeling that to grow at a similar rate to the U.S. billed business growth. And secondly, when we think about your payout ratio, what's the company's -- what's your thought process on dividend versus buyback at this point?\nDaniel T. Henry: So in MR, we had growth on the expense line of 10%, which is fairly in line with the growth that we see in spending. And most of our products have a report -- a reward component related to it. In any given quarter, it's also impacted by what the weighted average cost per point is and a number of other factors. So to the extent rewards is a couple of percentages, growth is a couple of percentages above or below, I would consider that to be in line with spending growth. So in the absence of an acceleration in redemptions, which lead to higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate, we would expect that rewards expense would grow generally in line with spending. Now as it relates to dividends payout, so we think about dividends as trying to, over time, maintain the kind of the yield or the payout ratio of dividends compared to earnings that we've historically have. So I would expect as earnings go up, we would try to keep that same type of payout ratio going forward, not radically change dividends either up or down. And to the extent we then generate capital, that is either dividend-ed out or used to support growth in our balance sheet to maintain our capital ratios, or to support acquisitions, we would use that in terms of share buybacks. We've said dimensionally we would expect about 50% to be retained in the business of earnings and 50% to be returned to shareholders, but that's very dependent on the number of acquisitions that are out there that we think are economical and will help us drive our business strategy. So this time if we saw more acquisitions we thought worthwhile, the payout could be a little lower than that. And to the extent we don't see acquisitions that we decide to make, then the payout ratio in a given year would be higher than that. So no change really in the policy that we've articulated over the past year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just as we think about 2012 earnings and your on average over time, the earnings forecast and our estimate are relatively flat with 2011. And I think at one point you had said or American Express had said maybe 2010 was a reasonable period to think about as kind of a base year for the 12% to 15% target earnings growth. Is that still true? I mean, just the expectations currently are for relatively little earnings growth as you don't have the reserve releases and you don't have the MasterCard/Visa payments, and you manage your expenses in a relatively slower growth than the global environment.\nDaniel T. Henry: So as you'd expect, I'm not going to forecast next year's EPS, but you're absolutely right. What we have said is 2010 is a good base year and off of that, on average and over time, we would look to achieve the financial targets that we have out there in terms of 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% EPS growth. So 2010 is the base year, and we haven't modified our targets at all. Obviously, we hit 22% growth in this year, and it's an example of when we are above that range.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Tax rate for 2012, any thoughts on tax rate?\nDaniel T. Henry: So our tax rate is generally 30% to 32%. So in the absence of benefits, either from planning or from the resolution of audits, I would expect it to be in that same range.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then the last question. Just on some of your initiatives like the Prepaid with Target, the Serve, I saw an interesting investment you made yesterday. Can you give any update on how's the Prepaid Target? How's that product looking? Loyalty Partners is something you guys certainly are pushing pretty hard. I'd love some update on some of these products.\nDaniel T. Henry: So there are 3 different topics. So Prepaid, we think, is an expanding market. We are investing in Prepaid. We think it has very good growth rates over time and attractive economics for us. So that is an area that we are focused as a growth area. Target is just one example of some of the new products that we have out there. We're focused both in the U.S. and really globally for Prepaid. So we're very pleased with how the Prepaid business is growing. In terms of the announcement we made yesterday. Basically, we've entered into an operating agreement with a company in China named Lianlian. Basically, we are going to license our Serve platform, which will be really what drives a digital wallet that they want to develop. As we all know, China is a very large market. It provides an opportunity for us to participate there. And we also made a equity investment in Lianlian Pay, Inc. of $125 million. So it's very much in line with our strategy, and we're pleased with that agreement and investment. In terms of Loyalty Partner, which is the acquisition that we closed in March of 2011, we think we -- and it continues to have good growth prospects, which is the reason that we acquired it, and we're in the process of doing the work necessary to execute against our strategy. So I think each of those are moving in line with the plans that we've set out for each of the respective businesses.\nOperator: And we have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays Capital.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the rewards expense in a slightly different way. By our calculation, rewards as a percentage of proprietary billed business was down pretty significantly Q-over-Q to about 78 basis points from 88 basis points last quarter. And I think you also indicated there was at least a slight increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter, so presumably that included, at least, a little bit of a reserve adjustment. Is that 78 basis point level assuming no material change in redemption rates from here, a reasonable run rate going forward?\nDaniel T. Henry: So certainly you could kind of look at it on a basis points to billings basis. We have invested in making Membership Rewards a highly attractive program, which we think it is. We think it's terrific if customers increased the amount of redemptions they make, because there's a clear link between cardmembers who do redemptions and growth in their spending as we go forward. So improving the program and increasing engagement, which is reflected in redemptions. But that ultimately impacts our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate. We think it's a good thing for the franchise. In this quarter, it so happened that, that increase, which is a slight increase, was similar to the fourth quarter of last year. If in fact as we go forward that ticks up, the ultimate redemption rate, we would actually view that as a positive thing, long term for the franchise. As you saw in the second and third quarter, if it moves up quite a bit compared to the prior year, then you get high growth rates on this line. However, if the ultimate redemption rate stayed at the current level with modest increases, which was similar year-to-year, then I think you have this relationship of rewards to billings continue into the future.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And understanding that you're not going to rigidly managed to that 8% long-term revenue growth target year-to-year, that said, in an environment where organic growth may be challenged because of the economy, does that create any greater sense of urgency for you to deploy some of those retained earnings and investments that may generate more immediate revenue benefit than, kind of, benefits that are further out?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. I think there's a tremendous focus on revenue growth in our industry. Certainly, what happened with the economy, which is uncertain, will have a bearing on whether we achieve the 8%. But I think it's important to remember that our business model is very different than many of our issuing competitors. They are very dependent on loan growth, which is particularly challenged. Net interest only represents about 15% or only represented about 15% of our revenues in this period. So to the extent we're successful with our business strategies and drive spending, then I think we're going to be in a better position than many of our competitors in terms of achieving revenue growth as we go forward. But in terms of how we allocate our investments, certainly as we've said in the past, we look to allocate investments to things that will give a short-term benefit, some to the medium term and some to the long term. Certainly in periods where things are more robust, you may tend to allocate more to the long term. And if it's a more challenging environment, you may do more focus on the piece that has short-term benefits. But we would never skew completely away from investing in medium to long term because we really do look at achieving results on average and over time, and that we're in the midst of investing in some new businesses that we think are -- have a lot of potential to them. So we would not detract from continuing to invest in those new businesses as we go forward. But certainly, we can modulate in terms of the amount we allocate into the short, medium and long-term buckets.\nOperator: We will go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a question and a follow-up from earlier on the capital front. So you're clearly still well above the targets that you had laid out several quarters back. And I think you returned 56% of capital this year, which is above the 50%. But should we not see any acquisitions materialize in the near term? Could there be the expectation that you could go above the 50% -- the 50% to 60% in the near term in terms of capital returns?\nDaniel T. Henry: If you think about the amount of capital that we generate, which is substantial, we have a fair amount of capital that we have discretion in terms of how we actually use it. So we generated earnings in the year of nearly $5 billion. So to the extent we're allocating 50% to really build the business because consumers are cautious about taking on additional loans. The growth in the balance sheet hasn't been that significant, so the amount of capital that's actually required to support that is $500 million or $600 million last year. So it leaves a lot of capacity for acquisitions. And if we find good acquisitions that can help us achieve our business strategies, we're going to go and make those as long as the price and the economics are reasonable. And if we found more than $1.9 billion, we go higher. On the other hand if we don't see good acquisitions, we would be inclined, actually, to return that capital to shareholders, if we're not going to use it in the very near term. That's always been our philosophy and will continue to be our philosophy. But if we see good acquisitions, we will seize on them. If not, we'll return the capital to shareholders.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and I guess -- well, it's a relatively smaller part of the billed business. Can you just give us maybe a little bit more of a sense of what you're actually seeing out of your customer base in Europe? I mean, I think you referenced something like you saw growth in the U.K., Germany and France and that there was declines. Any further clarity you could give just on what you're seeing or what your expectations are for that?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So let me just add 1 or 2 more sentences to my prior answer as related to capital. So what I just described is the capital philosophy that we have, but obviously, what we actually do would be dependent on the Fed approving the plan that we submitted to them on January 9. So I would just put that as a modifier to the comments I made a minute ago. As it relates to Europe, I mean we saw 8% growth in the third quarter, 4% growth this quarter. The countries, certainly the U.K. and Germany and France, the companies that are -- the countries that are stronger, there we've seen declines from previous quarters in terms of growth rate, but still we're seeing growth in the mid-single digits, which is pretty good. And as you'd expect in the countries that are more impacted, we're seeing less growth or actually a slight decline, which is what we saw in Italy. So beyond that, I don't have any other additional color to add, but I think that will give you a sense. And what you'd expect is exactly is what we're seeing: more impact on the countries that are under greater economic stress in terms of their funding.\nOperator: We will move on to Marc Lombardo with Meredith Whitney.\nMarc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC: Just wanted to see, kind of following up on Ryan's question. Are you able to breakout the percent that Europe represented in billed business either for 4Q or for 2011?\nDaniel T. Henry: In terms of what percent of billed business? So in 2010, it was 12%. So if you look across the year, based on the information that we provided to you, Europe has actually grown at a slower rate than the rest of the world. So it could be still 12% or slightly less than that, but I would say in that neighborhood. Probably a little less than what we had last year when it represented 12% of billings.\nMarc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC: Okay, great. And then domestically, are you noticing that cardmembers are trading down still?\nDaniel T. Henry: Trading down in terms of the average ticket price?\nMarc Lombardo - Meredith Whitney Advisory Group LLC: Correct.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don't think we -- I'm not aware that there's been any notable change in average ticket price. The positive is in the U.S., billings have really held up well. Growth has been 11% compared to 12% last quarter. And it's pretty broad-based, both in consumers, small business and corporate spending. So -- and as I said before, the average spend of our customers continues to grow very nicely, showing high levels of engagement on their part.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I don't know if you addressed this or not, I have been multitasking here, but could you comment on [indiscernible] any update on the Department of Justice case? I believe at that time in October of 2010, you'd set it around a 2-year window for some movement in that case. Is there any timeline that we should be aware of there? And then secondarily, is there any thoughts you can give us relative to your rules on surcharging and whether or not Visa and MasterCard are rolling back their rules on surcharging a lot [indiscernible] in the U.S. could impact your business model?\nDaniel T. Henry: So there's no real update on the DoJ case. The first time that we'll have anything new would be there is a schedule to complete discovery I think in the first quarter of 2013. So right now, this discovery is taking place, and that'll take place over the course of the next year. So no real update in those terms. In terms of surcharging, I think there's nothing new on our part in terms of any changes to our policies in that regard. And the place we have seen surcharging to the greatest degree, which is a little bit of an old story now, is Australia. Certainly it had an impact on us initially, when it took place a couple of years ago, but we continue to evolve our business strategy there and have had very healthy growth rates in the market and are doing well. So nothing really to update that's new as it relates to surcharging.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Is there any relationship between the 2? The DoJ kind of seem, as a matter of fact, seem to be okay with surcharging. It's more about allowing discounting. Is it possible you could allude [ph] to the DoJ case to retain the ability to not allow merchants to surcharge in the U.S.?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think that case is primarily whether merchants could steer from one credit card company to another credit card company. I think it's the basis of the primary point in the suit. As we've said before, we have an advantage on the discount-rate basis compared to Visa and MasterCard, but there's only a certain limited amount of economics there. So it could be a real question in my mind of whether there's enough economics to actually cause somebody to switch from one credit card product to another credit card product given the potential cost that could be involved in that. But it's really a case focused on whether merchants can steer from one credit card to another. Basically within Durbin, they're allowed to steer from credit cards to debit, but that case is about credit card to credit card. And merchants have always had the ability and the right to give discounts based on payments for cash.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Dan, your net interest income as a proportion of total revenues has been coming down 15% this quarter. I think it was historically in the sort of 20% range. Should we expect that trend to continue the decline in net interest income as loan growth is less of a focus and you continue to look at higher end transactors?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, I think it's going to be totally dependent on the behaviors of our customers. If you look at the paydown rates in the lending trust last month or even a year ago, they are kind of all in that 30% range up a little bit, down a little bit. So we had gone through a period where it was increasing quite a bit. It seems to have stabilized here some. So it depends on whether that continues. We are focused on premium lending, but it certainly doesn't mean that our customers aren't going to evolve periodically. Certainly, they're picking a lending product because they want the ability and opportunity to revolve periodically. Now as we've talked about, we have some more transactors that we had historically in the portfolio. But I think lending will continue to be an important revenue stream at 15%, but it really depends on how consumers think about debt and how far they want to leverage. I don't think anybody knows whether that's complete yet or whether it will start to be more willing to take on some more revolving debt periodically. So really we're going to have to wait and see how customer behavior plays out. It's hard to pinpoint it since it's really a new space for where they were historically. But for us, the important thing is to put products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs, and then they can use the product in a way that really meets their needs. So we can continue to be focused on that. But certainly, if there's the ability to put products out there in customers' hands and they would choose to evolve more, that's fine with us as long as the credit is right. Or if they choose to evolve a little less, that's fine with us as well. So we'll have to see how it evolves. It's really dependent on customer behavior going forward.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And what proportion of your lending book is at introductory rates now?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don't know what it is, but it's very small. You can certainly see from public data that we are not using balance transfer the way some competitors are. And even in our acquisition, it's not a huge tool. So I would say the amount at introductory rates is relatively small within the scheme of the whole portfolio.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Less than 10%?\nDaniel T. Henry: I don't know.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just your net interest yield declined. You've guided to, I think in the USCS business, 8% to 9%. Is any proportion -- any portion of the decline this last quarter or any of the guidance driven by CARD Act-related look backs?\nDaniel T. Henry: So the answer to that is no. We thought it would -- before we started, before the CARD Act was passed, we were kind of in this high 8%, 9% range. When we put in pricing changes, we said our objective was to get back to where we were after the impact of the CARD Act. And we were successful at doing that. 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis is pretty minor, but it's not due to a look back. Certainly in the future, regulators will come and take a look at that, and you'll feel pretty comfortable with our position. But until you actually have somebody come in and look at it, you don't know if they concur completely with the steps that we've taken. But from our perspective, we're in an appropriate spot. And to specifically answer your question, no, it wasn't due to a look back.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then just one unrelated real quick. What proportion of total billed business is GNS right now?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don't know exactly. Have we disclosed this? I think it's about 15% in that range. Could be 14%, could be 16%, but we'll take a look and before we get off the phone, answer that question. I think it's 15%.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: This was, I think, the first time in a while you've seen billed business growth below 20% in GNS. Is there anything to be cautious -- caution on in that area?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think we were getting a lift over the last couple of quarters as a result of the Macy's agreement that we put in place. But if you go back, we have many, many quarters where GNS business was growing at more than 20%. And 17% growth, which is what I think we had this quarter, is pretty darn good. So I think GNS continues to be a very good line of business for us, and we think it has good prospects as we go forward.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Dan, I believe earlier you referenced the uptick in U.S. Card Services, the -- or charge card services, the charge-off increase. You mentioned that obviously, new business is not going to limit charge-offs but to drive revenue at an economic return. But can you talk about maybe how you've widened the credit scope maybe for the charge card customer? I don't know if you could give FICO or maybe tiering ranges, but it sounds like you're going a little deeper in terms of credit.\nDaniel T. Henry: So we basically keep our credit standards pretty constant, both in the past and now. Certainly, when the recession hit, we tightened up some, but I think now, our view in terms of the type of credit worthiness that we want is not dissimilar to what we've looked for historically. Certainly we've built in to our models all those earnings that we've had over the past couple of years. But the good growth we've had is really based on the fact that our strategy is to grow charge card and that we've allocated investments to acquiring charge card customers, which is what's really driving really the growth in that business as opposed to having credit standards that are not as tight as we've historically had. So we'll do it by designing products that customers want to have and by adding both acquisition investments and loyalty investments that drives higher levels of spending.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And then regarding marketing and promotion, you pointed out that your expense containment, you guys are executing on your strategy and one of the key areas of reduction of expense has been marketing. But it seems that some of your peers are ramping up marketing spend now. And I was just curious, how would you respond to that? Do you watch market share? And I guess, is it possible to maintain low marketing spend in the face of an industry that seems to be increasing marketing spend?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we certainly do focus on market share. I mean, one of our objectives is to continue to gain market share. And if you look back over the last 10 years, other than in periods when there's a slowdown, we've gained market share. I think if you went back to 2002 or something, our market share was, in the U.S. for credit, was 19.9%. And today, it stands at about 26.4%. So we've made steady progress there, and we want to continue to make steady progress. Now you refer to low levels of investment. So I would say we're in actually the opposite position. In terms of marketing, in 2010, we took marketing expense to very high levels, levels notably above where we've ever been before. We think about marketing, if you look historically, as being about 9% of revenues. And in this quarter, we're at 9% of revenue. So we think those are levels of investment that can drive the business. So it's nice to have even higher levels. But at this level, we think we can be successful at driving business in a way that helps us meet our financial targets. And the level of investments that we're making in some of our other businesses that run through the OpEx line, as we talked about before, we have increased those. And we think we have levels of spending and investment that, again, can continue to grow our business. So I don't think about investments being at a low level. They are at very healthy levels as we go forward.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. And one final question. As you have pointed out earlier the call, revenue seems to be a challenge for you. And revenue growth seems to be a challenge to the industry. And just wondering if we're starting to see receivables, loans pickup little bit to find, like, 3% growth. Is that eventually ever going forward, maybe emphasize loan growth a little bit more and collect more interest income to offset maybe slowing billed business growth elsewhere?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think it will be really be driven a little bit by what I talked about before. We're going to look to continue to have products in the marketplace that meet our customers' needs. So I would say if we see loan balances decline, it would be because the customer's deciding to be more cautious. And if we see loan growth pickup some, it would be because the customer wants to utilize the revolving feature on the products in terms of how they live their lives. So I think it's going to be more driven by consumers' behavior than us changing our focus on whether we want to just put on more loan balances. We, as a company, have never had a target in terms of what loan should be or what loan growth should be. Where loans go is simply an outcome of how our customers decide to use the products that we put in their hands.\nOperator: And we have no one else in queue.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, very good. All right. Thank you, everyone, for participating on the call. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the American Express Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.\nRick Petrino: Thank you. Good evening. We appreciate everyone joining us for today's discussion. Before I turn it over to our CFO, Dan Henry, I do need to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report, already on file with the SEC. In the third quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now listed on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some of -- some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed, and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will open the line for Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, thanks, Rick. I'll start on Slide 2, Summary of Financial Performance. The revenues net of interest expense was $7.6 billion, 9% higher than the prior year. Now this growth rate is down slightly from the second quarter, but it is best-in-class compared to issuing competitors. On an FX-adjusted basis, it's 6% growth.  Net income came in at $1.2 billion, 13% higher than last year, and EPS is $1.03. Return on equity is 28% and you can see that shares outstanding have decreased and that's a result of share repurchases, which I'll cover in more detail later. We move to Slide 3, Metric Performance. You can see the Billed business was $207.7 billion, up 16% and 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. So Billed business, again, showed strong growth. It's the seventh quarter in a row that we've had strong Billed business growth. We are growing over strong growth last year, while our competitors' spending growth last year -- while improving or growing the overall lower growth rates the year before. Cards-in-force are 95.8 million cards, up 8%. That represents 21% growth in cards in GNS and 2% growth in proprietary cards. Average spend continues to increase, reflecting the high level of engagement of our Cardmember base. Cardmember Loans are up 2%, the same growth rate that we saw in the second quarter. And travel sales grew 13%, driven primarily by air sales. Moving to Slide 4. So this is Billed Business Growth by Segment, and we continue to have broad-based growth across all segments. Total Billed business growth decreased about 2%, compared to the second quarter. If we look at USCS, it came in at 12%, down 1% from the second quarter; Global Corporate Products is at 14%, also down 1% from the second quarter; GNS continues to be very strong at 23%, down 2% from the second quarter; and International Consumer came in at 9%, again, 2% down from the second quarter. So we see a slight decline across each segment. But Billed business is holding up well considering the economic uncertainty. Given these strong growth rates, we would expect to gain share again this quarter in the U.S. Moving to Slide 5, this is Billed Business Growth by Region. So Billed business growth by region on an FX-adjusted basis, if we look at Asia, it came in at 19%, the same growth rate as the second quarter. Latin America and Canada is at 14%, down 1% from the second quarter. The U.S. is at 13%, again, down 1% from the second quarter. EMEA came in at 8%, down from 11% in the second quarter. However, we continue to have strong growth in a number of countries in Europe. Germany grew 10%, France 8% and U.K. 12%. Now they're each down between 100 and 300 basis points. On an absolute basis, it is good growth. So we have very good broad-based growth across the regions, although more softness in Europe.  If you look at Slide 6, so this is Lending Billed Business compared to Managed Loan Growth. So the solid line is the growth in spending on lending products, and this is at 14% in the third quarter. That compares to 18% in the second quarter of this year and 15% in the third quarter of 2010. The dotted line is growth in loans, and you can see that it is at 2%, the same as the second quarter. We continue to have a spread between the growth in spending on lending products and the growth in loan balances. This is due in part to our actions as we have changed our strategy to focus on Charge Card and premium lending. So just as an aside, Charge Card Billed business and receivable growth continue to move in tandem.  But getting back to lending, our lending focus on premium lending and the reduction in balance transfers results in a base that is more inclined to be transactors and revolve less. So if we went back to the second quarter of '08, transactors would have represented about 16% of our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2011, transactors represent 29% of the portfolio.  If we were to look at the lending trust and look at payments rates, in September, the payment rate was 31.23%, and that's up from September of 2010 when it was 29.28%. So the combination of our focus on premium lending and the fact that cardmembers are deciding to delever is resulting in the spread in the growth rates between spending and loan balances. For us, the net effect is a lower risk profile. So if you look at Slide 7, which is Net Interest Yield, in the third quarter of this year, it is very much in line with our previous guidance. It comes in at 9%, and we had indicated that yield would migrate back to historic levels either in the high 8s or 9%. They reflect the changes in pricing that we did related to the CARD Act, and also cardmember behavior. Going forward, yield will continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including credit quality, revolve rates and the cost of funds. They are also a subject to regulatory review through the look back. The stability that we see in yield and the 2% growth in loan balance is resulting in net interest income in the second quarter being flat with the second quarter of last year. If we move to Slide 8, Revenue Performance, discount revenue reflects the 16% growth in Billed business growth. But the reason that this is growing at 12% is a result of the slight decline in the discount rate, the relative faster growth of GNS Billed business, and for GNS, we get a part of the discount rate and higher contra-revenue items, including corporate incentives and partner payments. Now the discount rate is at 2.54, the same as the second quarter of this year, but 2 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year, driven primarily by a change in mix. As we have said in the past, the discount rate will decrease as we succeed in our everyday spend strategy and to the extent we have a change in mix by country. Net card fees grew 6%, primarily reflecting a mix shift to higher fee cards and slightly higher proprietary cards-in-force. Travel commissions and fees are down 1%, and this reflects increased worldwide travel sales, offset by a decrease in sales commission rates, as well as the fact that last year we had revenue recognition upon the signing of certain supplier contracts.  Other commission fees are driven primarily by the fact that we have acquired Loyalty Partners. So their fees and commissions are in this year, but were not in last year. Other revenues reflect higher GNS partner royalty revenues, higher foreign exchange fees and higher merchant fees. Net interest income is flat, and this is the first time in many quarters that we are flat, and this is a result of the slightly -- the slight growth in loans, offset by a slightly lower yield compared to last year. Total revenues net of interest growth of 9% is notably better than the other issuing competitors and it reflects the difference in our business model where we focused on driving fee income and spend compared to them who are more focused and reliant on net spread income. So fundamentally, we have a different business model. But generally, when we talk about our revenues, we indicated about 80% of our revenues are fee-related and 20% are related to net spread. But in fact, in this quarter, net interest income only represents about 16% of our revenues where our competitors often have between 50% and 80% of their revenues dependent on net interest income. So if we move to Slide 9, Provision For Losses, we can see that the Charge Card provision is at $174 million, up from $84 million last year. That's the result of slightly higher dollar write-offs in this quarter, but it also reflects a lower reserve release that we had last year. So Charge Card improved faster, and most of the benefit from reserve releases have taken place at this point, so the major difference is higher reserve releases in the third quarter of 2010. But credit performance is really excellent and credit metrics are at historic lows.  If we look at Cardmember Loans, our lending provision, it is at $48 million compared to $261 million in the third quarter of 2010. So the third quarter of 2011 reflects lower dollar write-offs. So the dollar write-offs in this quarter were $427 million, and that compares with $809 million of write-offs in the third quarter of 2010. Now that is partially offset by us having lower reserve releases in this quarter this year compared to last year. And again we see excellent credit performance and really credit metrics and that are at historic lows. Moving to Slide 10, so this is Charge Card Credit Performance. You can see that the write-off rate in Charge Card portfolios, both the U.S. Consumer business, International Consumer and Global Corporate Products have increased slightly, both sequentially and compared to last year, but they remain at historic lows. So the slight increase in Charge Card metrics align with the company's Charge Card strategic objectives of growing and expanding this business. Our objective is to grow the business profitably and not to have the lowest write-off rate, so you should expect these metrics to increase in the future as we grow this business. Moving to Slide 11, Lending Write-off Rates, so the lending write-off rates continue to improve, both in the U.S. and in the International Consumer business. In the third quarter for 2011, the write-off rate is 2.6%. That compares with 3.1% in the second quarter of this year and 5.1% in the third quarter of 2010. If we look at the lending trust in the U.S., the write-off rate in September was 2.3%, down from 2.7% in August. Again these are historic lows. If we go to Slide 12, we look at lending 30 Day Past Due, the 30-day past due in the United States is stable in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and the International Consumer metric continues to improve. Here, if we were to look at the lending trust and look at 30-days past due, that number in July was 1.5, improved in August to 1.4 and in September was back to 1.5. So I think we are seeing stabilization of this metric in the current quarter. If we move to Slide 13, so this slide is intended to give some insight as we look forward. If we start on the right-hand side, we can see that bankruptcies continue to trend down. And I'd remind you that at the time that we're notified of bankruptcies, generally 2/3 of those accounts have already been written off. So if we look to the left side and look at the upper left chart, and these are balances that roll from current to 30-days past due. If you look at the green triangles, so these are accounts that rolled in February, March and April of this year, these accounts will write off 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent. So the green triangles wrote off in the third quarter of this year. If we look next to that, to the next 3 blue triangles, you can see that they are slightly lower than the green triangles. If the 30-due past day -- 30-day past due to write-off rate, which is the bottom left chart, remains constant, then we would expect in the fourth quarter of this year for write-offs to be slightly lower than the third quarter, but that's also dependent on bankruptcies and recoveries remaining unchanged.  So the pace of improvement in our credit metrics have slowed, and we have now reached all-time lows. Again our objective is not to manage our business in order to minimize write-off rates. Going forward, we will continue to balance our risk profile with the company's strategic growth objectives, and over time, we do not expect loss rate to stay at these historic lows. Moving to Slide 14, so this is looking at Lending Reserve Releases. So the chart shows lending reserve releases across the top by quarter. The light blue bar are the dollar write-offs in the quarter and the dark blue bar is provision, which are the write-off dollars less the reserve releases. So the third quarter reserve release was approximately the same as in the second quarter, but less than we saw in the first quarter of this year as the improvement in metrics have started to moderate or stabilize. In the third quarter of 2010, we had $500 million of reserve releases. Going forward, we would expect reserve releases to diminish. Going to Slide 15, so this is Lending Reserve Coverage, and we can see that as credit metrics continue to improve, reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past due have come down, both for U.S. Card and worldwide. So although we had reserve releases of $400 million in the quarter, coverage remains at appropriate levels. Moving to Slide 16, Expense Performance. Total expenses increased 13% or 11% on an FX-adjusted basis. Marketing and promotion decreased 13% from the third quarter of 2010 when we hit record levels of spending. Marketing is still 10% of revenues, above the historic level of about 9% of revenues. So we still have healthy levels of investment, and I'll talk about this more in a moment.  Cardmember rewards and service cost increased 25%, but at a lower growth rate than the second quarter. This reflects rewards-related spending, both in MR and on co-brand products. Plus, within MR, it also reflects the impact of a small increase in the ultimate redemption rate, which reflects higher engagement and higher redemption levels. The cost of cardmember service increased, reflecting the cost of new benefits for U.S. cardmembers. Operating expense increased 15%. But if you exclude the impact of the Visa/MasterCard settlement, this expense, operating expense, grew 9% year-over-year, a notable slowing from the growth rate of 21% in the second quarter. We expect to further slow operating expense growth rate towards the end of this year and into next year, and I'll speak about that more in a few minute -- moments. The tax rate of 28% reflects a benefit related to the distribution of foreign earnings with the associated realization of foreign tax credits. We increased our investment levels in the quarter above previously planned levels in light of this benefit. So if we move to Slide 17, so this is some more detail on marketing expense. And here, each of the bars reflect spending by quarter. As discussed in prior quarters, the high level in investment spending in marketing and promotion has been enabled by the credit provision benefits from improving credit and the Visa/MasterCard settlement payments. As these credit benefits lessen over time and the Visa and MasterCard payment cease, we have the flexibility to move marketing and promotion back towards historical levels or 9% of revenues. Moving to Slide 18, so this is more detail on operating expense. So if we look at salaries and employee benefit, it increased 18%, reflecting a higher level of employees, merit increases, higher benefits, severance costs related to reengineering and higher incentive compensation. If we look at professional services, this decreased 2%, reflecting lower collection cost as you would expect as credit improves and lower consulting fees. The increase in occupancy cost is primarily driven by Loyalty Partners, which is in this year's numbers, but are not in last year's number. We've also broken out the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds so you can see those. In total, you can see that we have made progress on our objective of slowing the growth in operating expense. So reported, it's at 15%. Excluding Visa/MasterCard, it grew at 9%, and that compares with 21% in the second quarter of this year. We expect to further slow the operating expense growth rate towards the end of this year, and into next year. Slide 19, this is more detail on operating expense, and this chart is intended to show the areas where we are investing and growing at a faster rate. And there's a difference between those operating expenses which are intended to drive growth and those which are more BAU operating expenses, which are growing at a slower rate. So at the upper left-hand side, you see new business initiatives and they include spending on Serve, Online Mobile, the Certify, Loyalty Partners, LoyaltyEdge and Business insights. You can also see that we're investing in GNS. And if you look back over the last 8 quarters, we have had Billed business growth of over 20%, so those investments are paying off. We continue to invest in sales force across International Consumer, Global Corporate Products and Merchant Services.  Variable tech investments generally have been around the average growth rate as they support growth in both our core business and our digital initiatives. And you can see that support functions and Global Services are growing at more modest rates. So operating expense relates both to our ongoing operations and our growth initiatives. Looking at Slide 20, so this has to do with expense flexibility, and here, adjusted expense are all expenses excluding provision divided by revenues. Now here, we recognize that we are currently at elevated levels. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrant back towards historical levels in 2 ways: First, through the growth in revenues; and second, through expense flexibility related to really all items in the P&L. The continued higher investment levels, which were enabled by our tax credit, is why our rate has stayed at 75% in the third quarter of this year. Moving to Slide 21, Capital Ratios, you can see that Tier 1 common ratio remained at 12.3%, the same as the second quarter. So the capital that we generated through net income and employee plans was offset by the distribution we made through repurchases and dividends, while risk-weighted assets stayed relatively level. So the 2.3% is higher than our target for Tier 1 common, and this is due to the fact that we had fewer acquisitions than we planned. As you remember, our guidelines are to retain about 50% of capital generated to support the growth of our balance sheet and acquisitions and to return to shareholders about 50% of capital generated through dividends and share repurchase. In the third quarter, we increased our share repurchase, given the limited amount of balance sheet growth and the fewer acquisitions, but we continued to have strong capital ratios. If we move to Slide 22, this is Total Payout Ratio. So this is a new slide, and this is the percentage of capital generated in each quarter or year that was returned to shareholders. So if we look at 2008, '09, 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, basically, the return of capital to shareholders was through dividends. In the second quarter of this year, we did repurchases of $750 million, and in the third quarter, we increased repurchases to $1.2 billion, given the level of balance sheet growth and acquisitions. Even with 105% payout in the third quarter, our Tier 1 common remain at 12.3%. Fourth quarter repurchases are projected to be $350 million. As part of our request that we made in our CCAR filing to the fed in January, we requested total repurchases of $3.2 billion -- $2.3 billion, thank you, and so therefore, we have about $350 million left of capacity. If we go to the next slide, Slide 23, looking at liquidity, we can see that we continue to hold excess cash and multiple securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we're holding $22 billion in cash and securities, and our maturities over the next 12 months are $19 billion. If we slide -- moving to Slide 24, so this is our deposit programs. So total deposits increased by about $1 billion from $31.6 billion to $32.5 billion in the quarter. Since we did not have balance sheet growth, it did not warrant additional or higher funding level. As we've discussed, deposits provide greater diversity in funding for us.  So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters. Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow faster than most of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons and a challenging economic environment, especially in Europe where growth slowed but is still very healthy at 8% on an FX-adjusted basis.  We also saw our average loans grow year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter and lending loss rates continue to improve. Our strong billings growth, coupled with flat net interest income, drove solid revenue growth, which continue to outpace our large issuing competitors, reflecting returns on our investments and the unique nature of our spend-centric business model. Solid revenue growth, improving credit trends and the benefit of lower effective tax rate provided the opportunity to continue to invest in the business at high levels, while also generating strong earnings. These investments are driving current metrics as we deliver high average spending and grow our card base, as well as build capabilities for the future.  We feel very good about our recent performance while we acknowledge that the economic environment remains uncertain. We continue to implement our plan to slow the year-over-year growth in our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012. And in the third quarter, we began to see some progress towards that goal at adjusted operating expense, which excludes the MasterCard receipt, grew 9% versus 21% in the second quarter.  Our success in a highly competitive environment and our focus on spending as opposed to spread are yielding high-quality results and solid revenue growth. Going forward, we will closely monitor our spending and credit trends, but to date, we are very pleased with our results and we are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to navigate through this environment.  Thanks for listening and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We now go to our first question, Mr. Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Dan, I was wondering if you could provide a little color on where Billed business trends are in October overall, and then maybe whether or not Europe's continued to sort of soften a bit or if that stabilized.\nDaniel T. Henry: So spend growth continues to hold up well in the fourth quarter. However, we are just a few weeks into the quarter and we will watch spending trends closely as we go forward in the next coming months.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And on Europe?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think -- I'd say we're holding up well, although we saw greater softness in Europe in the third quarter. So we'll have to see how that pans out as we go through this quarter.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Question on Rewards. The Rewards expense as a percentage of discount revenue was 37% this quarter. And if you go back a couple of years ago, it was running at the 30% level. And, I mean, you've been bringing up your redemption rate. You said you brought it up a little bit more this quarter. And I was redeeming some points myself the other day, it's awfully easy to do. And so I don't know why I wouldn't redeem all of them easily over time, but is there -- how much was the one-time hit this quarter for higher redemption rate? And, I mean, is this run rate, is that permanent?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we're pleased you redeemed your points. We believe that to the extent cardmembers redeem points, we have greater engagement. They spend more with us. We have lower attrition. So the economics associated with that, we think, are very positive for the franchise over time. So in any given period, the Membership Rewards expense is going to be driven by 2 primary -- well, 3 primary factors. One, where the volumes are. And so to the extent we have volume growth, we're going to have growth in expense related to that. And the other 2 factors are the ultimate redemption rate and the weighted average cost per point. Now to the extent that we are having higher levels of engagement, higher redemptions by customers, we take that new information and put it into our calculation of what we think the ultimate redemption rate is going to be. And to the extent that it's higher, then we are going to have higher expense related to that. I went through a explanation on the call last quarter that says expense is really a combination of the activity and the current period, as well as repricing our bank which is very large, which is a good asset for us, but that repricing results in additional expense. To the extent the redemption rates are going up, we would see growth rates on that expense line in excess of the spend growth in the quarter. So what happens in the future is going to be very dependent on the behavior of our customers in future quarters. If, in fact, it runs at a slightly higher rate, then the growth in Billed business or spending, again, I would view that as a positive. The growth rate in this quarter is less than we saw in the second quarter, and that's because the growth in the redemption rate in the third quarter was somewhat less than the growth rate and the ultimate redemption rate that we saw in the second quarter.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. Follow-up question just on share repurchases, when and how do you go back to request more -- essentially, you bought back 2% of the company this quarter and your capital ratios didn't change. And I know you're looking at acquisitions, so maybe thoughts around the -- I mean, a little color on how you expect to reload the share repurchase authorization from the government, if you will, or from the fed.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, last year, the fed had ourselves and I think all other bank holding companies submit filings, which reflected what our base plan was for the coming year. Also required us to have projections in an adverse and a more stressful environment that they reviewed. We made their request for share buybacks as part of that filing. Now our request for share buybacks was based on this notion that we would distribute about 50% of generated capital back to shareholders and retain about 50% for growth in the balance sheet and acquisitions. So the 2.3 was our amount. Now we performed well during this year. Balance sheet growth has not been significant and we've made some acquisitions, but not at the level that would warrant maintaining 50% of the capital. Now we could have ventured to make a new request to the fed in the recent month or so, but we thought it was more prudent just to address what we think our needs will be next year in the filing that we will do this January related to the required filing, not related to 2012. So we will be mindful of this year's experience as we make our request for next year.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the expense line, you guys came in at 75%, I think a little higher than some of us have been looking for, but you did mention there was, too, the tax credit. And I know that your guidance calls for -- the rate of change is slow. So can you just help us understand your ability to generate positive operating leverage? And at what point will we see revenue growth exceed expense growth? And I have another one after that.\nDaniel T. Henry: As I think, we have been in a situation, really, over the past 2 years through 2010, 2011, where we have had very good credit performance. That results, as you know, in the release reserves, and we've had the Visa/MasterCard proceeds. And we've decided to use that money to, in part, improve earnings and, in part, invest in the future to drive business momentum. And that's what's really resulted in that ratio staying up at that 75% level or so. As we slow the growth in expense, as you would expect to see, that ratio come back down. It's going to come back down really in 2 ways. One is the growth in revenues and second is the slowing of the growth in expenses. In this period, if we hadn't had the tax benefit, then we would have ratcheted back investments and you would have actually seen that percentage come back down. But since we knew we had the tax benefit coming, we decided to invest it, and therefore, it starts -- it stayed at higher level. So you would think over the coming quarters, you would start to see that percentage to come down if we execute against our plans.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just on the lending side, I think you had alluded to when you've had the conference last month that you would expect that losses would be lower than the 4.5% that you had historically had. But I guess numbers are running significantly lower than that, and your lending strategy has changed so much. So can you just help us understand either in numerically or contextually how you're thinking about where losses will eventually stabilize?\nDaniel T. Henry: I'll do it contextually.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I figured I'd at least try.\nDaniel T. Henry: So 4.5% is the rate we had over a 10-year period going back. As you said, we have changed our strategy. We are focused on premium lending. So I would expect it to, as I said before, be below that 4.5%, and I would expect it to be above where we are now. And these are really historic lows. And our desire at the end of the day is not driven by any target for a write-off rate. It is to make good, economic decisions that will benefit the franchise over the long term. That's the way we've always mirrored investment decisions. That's the way we'll continue to make them, and I suspect write-off rates are going to, obviously, settle somewhere between where we are now and that 4.5%. But to actually peg an exact number will be very dependent on the businesses decisions we're making. And as you know, there's a cyclical impact here, and in more robust times this is a lower number. And in times of economic stress, this is a higher number, but I think it will obviously be below where we were historically.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Two questions. The first, if you could -- as a follow-up to the last question, be a little bit more specific on, did you reinvest the entire tax credit, one; and two, as it relates to that, a little bit more specific on what you might have spent it on so we can see the one-time nature in that spending. Secondly, have you seen any significant impact from the loss of Continental that you can point to?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we did reinvest the 100% of the tax credit. It wouldn't be one isolated item. We knew that we had that resource going into the quarter. So as we've decided on our investment allocation, we took it into consideration. But you can see in marketing, while it's down from the third quarter of last year, it is at elevated levels. And as you look at expenses on the chart, maybe in Slide 19, you can see that we're investing in sales force, in GNS, in new business initiatives. So it really was part of the allocation of resources across all of those as opposed to just one isolated item. As it relates to Continental, at the end of the day, the removal of Continental from our MR program caused some increase in point redemption. However, quite frankly, the impact of Continental leaving so far has been less than we would have anticipated. I point out that even with Continental leaving the program, our Platinum Card base in the U.S. in the third quarter grew. And we believe that our MR program remains the industry-leading option for high-spending customers. So there was some customers that moved, but less than we expected. And we continue to have a very strong card base of affluent customers who spend at high levels.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I had a question, but actually I'll ask a follow-up to that. I mean, if U.S. Bank lost Northwest, held together much better than everyone have thought, didn't lose that many customers, you lost Continental, you're saying you're holding -- the cards holding together, you're not losing any customers. Does that imply the industry is just paying too much for these airline partnerships?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, I think, as we know, the cost of rewards related to co-brands are higher than our cost of our Membership Rewards program. We think our Membership Rewards program functions very well and is a program that many customers want because it provides a lot of options. Instead of being tied to just one redemption option, there are many redemption options, I think over 100 redemption options, which customers find to be very valuable. But when you look at co-brands, despite the higher cost from a rewards perspective of co-brands, those customers tend to spend at a higher level and the credit losses on those portfolios tend to be at the low end of the range. So the economics associated with co-brand products are good, and that's why we continue to have those programs and endeavor to make them more attractive. So while it was a different rewards mix, at the end of the day, when you look at the economics of a product, you need to look at a combination of what does it cost you to acquire the customer, what are their spending levels, what are their revolve levels, what will ultimately be the write-off rates within that group, determine the overall economics. So while rewards costs are higher, the economics of those programs are very good.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And then just in terms of pricing on cards, the environment is worrying to a lot of people in terms of mail volumes increasing, balance transfer options are out there. I guess looking at this quarter's data, your yields are up 30 bps, USPs are up 20, JPMorgans are up 2, some of the other guys are down, but even in the industry average is flat. I guess any more color you can provide on why the yields were up, 30 bps linked quarter? Is there seasonality in there? Is it the higher current 30 roll rates or is pricing competition not as bad this year?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think we had indicated that we thought that yields would eventually migrate back to where we were before the CARD Act. And I think we've actually seen that now, but as you know there are a myriad of factors that come into play. Credit quality, to the extent you have more people in delinquency, unhealthy pricing that could drive it up to the extent you have more transactors that can drive it down. Most of our cards are variably priced. So when cost of funds go up or down, it doesn't have a huge impact. But as I said before, transactors are a decent part of our lending portfolio. So their interest costs really do matter. For us, as I indicated, the pay down rate in the third quarter this year improved compared to the third quarter of last year. But in fact, the pay down rate dropped out a little bit, 20 to 30 basis points, from the second quarter. So the fact that the revolve rate changed a little bit, I think that had an impact on the higher yield that we saw. But I think it's going to move around quarter by quarter based on all those factors. But to the extent it kind of stays in that range of the high 8s to 9%, I think that enables us to have good economics related to those products. And so I wouldn't focus so much on the little moves quarter to quarter, but more that we can sustain the appropriate yield over time in terms of assessing the economics of those products. I guess the other thing that I would note is that while others are doing BTs, we are doing very, very few in that area because our focus is not bringing on customers who are going to sit with a loan balance. Our objective is to bring customers who spend and occasionally revolve. And that is really at the heart of the difference between our business model and a competitor's business model. We want to generate fees from spending and allow our customers to revolve if they choose to, but it's not to bring customers who are going to sit with balances. We think that will put us in good stead over the long term because we think competitors, quite frankly, have a challenge. If you look back in history before the recession, loan balances were only growing at about 5%. And we can certainly see within our portfolio that there has been a separation between the growth in spending and lending products and the growth in loans as customer or consumers have decided to deleverage more. So that's going to present the challenge for them. But I think our business model is right for the environment as we go forward.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: A couple of questions. Just one other angle on the expense question is that you are suggesting that you will be bringing it down this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where you think you can do that in a way that doesn't impact your revenue growth, in particular, during this heavy spend holiday season. I'm just wondering where the flexibility is.\nDaniel T. Henry: All right. Okay, so we haven't said that we're going to bring spending down. What we've said is that we are going to slow the growth rate in operating expense growth. Okay, so there's a little bit of distinction there. But I do think that we do see some opportunities. I mean, I think, we saw it in the third quarter, right? So in the third quarter, we saw that as credit is better, collections cost came down. I think we have brought down consulting services. So that's something that's very discretionary. We can decide to spend that at a higher level if we think we have an investment that we want to make in a new area or to enhance a product. But that's very discretionary at the end of the day. We also continue to be at elevated levels of spending on marketing and promotion. In this quarter, it's about 10% of revenues. Historically, we've been able to generate business momentum with marketing and promotions being about 9% of revenues. And then, as we've discussed, we set up Global Services group, which is really intended to be very focused on high-quality service by continually improving the efficiency in the way that we do things. We've set targets for that group that history has spoken about. We are being very successful at executing against those targets and achieving those goals that we've set for ourselves. So it's really across each of those types of areas that would enable us to slow the growth of operating expense while still having appropriate levels of resources to continue to drive the growth and the business momentum that we've generated in 2010 and 2011.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: The recent hoopla on the debit card fees, that this may be causing some disruption in the debit card market. I remember, a year ago, you started to position your Charge Card as been tried as an alternative [ph] to the debit card. And I wasn't sure if you had any update on the results of that campaign and when you were thinking that this could be a potential opportunity for American Express to be able to share given what's going on in the debit card market.\nDaniel T. Henry: I think we've also talked about the fact that Charge Card has some features that are very similar to debit and there are some aspects that are different. So while it's a pay-in-full product, it's not immediate, but there are some similarities. And if you're sufficiently disciplined to pay in full, then you can also get reward points and other services that are not available if you utilize the debit product. So I think a key here is that we've never been in the debit business. The profit pool in debit was never that large. With the changes required by Durbin, whatever profit pool was there is gone. So banks are looking to say, \"How do we look at the overall economics of our relationship with a customer that they have?\" And to the extent that relationship is relatively limited, then I think they've discussed that they really don't have the ability to provide that service for free without some kind of a cost. So I think what we're going to see is, over time, potentially a effort on the banks of -- on the part of banks to either charge for that service or to migrate customers either to Prepaid. And as you know, we have a very strong Prepaid offering. We issued a new Prepaid product that if you acquire that Prepaid product online, there are no fees to acquire it and no fees over time. So if people move in that direction, we have a product that is available. To the extent that banks push customers more towards credit, we think that, that would be an opportunity for us to grow our business as well. So we have to wait and see how this all plays out, but it could well be that this turns into more of an opportunity than a risk at the end of the day, although the whole script hasn't been written, so we'll have to see how that plays out.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: It's fair to say that at this point there's no plans to restart that campaign. I guess I was also wondering were you happy with that campaign and the results you got? It seems like it is a different product from a consumer standpoint and I wasn't sure if the message you were sending last year really translated to consumers. A follow-up question would be actually on Serve. When should we expect Serve, if you had any update on it, when is it -- the volume metrics or any disclosure around Serve and how that's going -- that it starts?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So I don't think we ever really had a campaign to say that the Charge Card is the equivalent of a debit product. I think in different conversations with investors, we probably talked about the fact that there are some aspects of the product that are similar, but the fact that it's a payment in full when you receive the statement, I would say it's more fundamentally a different product. And the Charge Card product is maybe really targeted at different set of consumers than consumers who are using the debit product. Debit products, I think, are probably more for smaller ticket item, for people who have more limited resources and are trying to manage them very carefully. As you know, our Charge Card products are really targeted at more affluent customers. They have fees attached to them, but they also have substantial benefits associated with them. And we have, on the other hand, had a campaign to grow Charge Card over the last year and a half, and we have been really very successful at acquiring high-spending cardmembers and growing cards. And you could also see the Charge Card spend in this quarter grew by 14% compared to the prior period. So we're being successful at acquiring cards and having our customers grow their spending on those cards. So in terms of Serve, your second question, what we have been targeting over this year, 2011, is to, first, launch Serve, which we did in March. You remember that we acquired Revolution Money in January of 2010. From early 2010 through March of this year, we looked at building on the platform, in building the capabilities. The launch that we did in March is really kind of Serve 1.0. We're going to look to enhance that platform and we've been focused on building the capabilities on that platform throughout 2011. The metrics that we put out there that we wanted to accomplish in 2011 was really to enter into a number of partnerships where we can actually drive customers in the future to the Serve platform. So this year, we announced the partnership with Verizon that integrates Serve into their pay-by-phone service and they're embedding Serve in new Verizon phones. We also announced the partnership with Sprint to embed Serve into the Sprint Zone. So we've signed also some agreements with AOL as well. So we are kind of hitting, in our mind, our objectives for this year to improve the platform and to sign new partnerships that will enable us to bring customers on to our network and to have Serve product. So I think for this year, those are the guideposts that I would look to for success. As we look to 2012, I think, then we're going to look to actually seeing how successful we are actually bringing customers onto a Serve product and onto our network. So those are the guideposts that we are looking at in terms of success.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Maybe I could just follow up on that rewards cost question asked previously. Despite my rough math, I think the redemption rate moved up to about 93%, and I guess I was just wondering like how much higher can it go given the current trends? And secondarily, just to the extent that you do need to take that redemption rate assumption up, you guys still feel comfortable that you could hit your historical kind of efficiency ratio targets as shown on Slide 20, in that scenario. And then maybe just a second question to that is just reserve coverage. And obviously, you had very strong coverage levels right now. What is the normal level if we head into next year?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So on the first question, you remember that in last quarter, we indicated that we were at 92% related to active customers. And that in the first quarter, we actually rounded up to 92% and we said we had growth in the ultimate redemption rate and that we kind of round it down to 92%. So in this quarter, we again had growth in the ultimate redemption rate, but we're still rounding down to 92%. So it grew, but still rounds down to 92%. So we're not at 93% yet. Now how high can it go? That's difficult to forecast. It will be dependent on the behaviors of customers in the future. So certainly, customers who have a trend [ph from their program already, on average have tried it at a rate that's below 92%. But we look at the behaviors of the active customers. And then we draw our curves into the future in terms of what we think the ultimate redemption rate will be. So the 92% represents those behaviors to date. As customers become more engaged, it will potentially drive that rate up. Will it ever get to 100%? I think that's probably unlikely. But based on customer behaviors, it certainly could go above the rates that we are at today. So the question about how does it fit into the efficiency ratio, so we can look at efficiency ratio, but I think we need to look at really all expenses, including provision. So I think that we do need marketing and promotion over time on average, and over time to kind of be 9% of revenues. On the other hand, because write-off rates are going to be lower than historic levels, then I think that's going to allow the efficiency ratio to probably be a little higher than it may have been prerecession. But we're going to need to balance how we decide to utilize our resources between Rewards and operating expense over time. And that's a judgment we'll make in the normal course of business in terms of how we decide what to allocate to marketing, what to allocate to Rewards, what to allocate to other business initiatives to build the capabilities. And that's a map and planning that we are doing now, have always done and will do in the future. And we believe that even with higher Rewards cost, that we can continue to achieve our current financial objectives of revenue growth of 8% plus and 12% to 15% EPS growth and an ROE of 25% plus. So even with the high Rewards cost, we'll be -- -- had planned stay with our current financial targets. So I think...\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: And the reserve coverage?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, reserve coverage. I think reserve coverage is obviously lower than it was a year ago or earlier this year. As credit improves, I would expect those ratios to gradually come down. This is an uncertain environment and so we're cautious as we release reserves. But to the extent we get to a point where there's less uncertainty, then I think you could potentially see lower reserve coverage than we have at the moment, but that will be driven by the fact and circumstances at the time.\nOperator: Next, we go to Ken Bruce with Bank of America.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was hoping you could provide a little bit more detail or decompose the corporate incentive payments and partnership payments that was in the contra revenues item this quarter. If there was one-time items, size it up in any way for me?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don't think there were any one-time items. I think we interact with our corporate customers and particularly our larger corporate customers, and we provide them incentives to do business with us. And certainly to the extent that their volumes increase above certain threshold levels, we provide incentives related to that as well. So these incentives are all around driving higher spend levels at the end of the day. So each quarter, we have new signings. And those new signings are reflected in the results. But again, even with these higher incentives that we're paying to corporate customers and partners, the economics around these agreements are very good. And we make that evaluation in terms of the returns that we're achieving and ensuring that they achieve our return thresholds. So I don't have more specifics than that, but these are good economic decisions that enable us to both grow the business and achieve our financial targets that we just discussed a moment ago. So I would think about these probably not differently than I think about Rewards. At the end of the day, you want to grow volumes and achieve the right economic returns, and these agreements are enabling us to do that. So let me just have this be the last question.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Can I have a follow-up?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, go ahead. Well, one follow-up and then one last question.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And it will be a 2-part follow-up. On the discount rate, you've, in the past, guided to a few basis point erosion per year. I think as you pointed out in your earlier comments, much of that was a mix change issue on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. I'm wondering is there an order of magnitude that you could provide in terms of the net discount rate which would include the contra revenue items as we think about forecasting? And then as a second part, how do you think about the overall level of transactors in your overall lending book? I think you pointed out it had grown from 16% to 29%. Based on the number or the percentage of mail drops, where do you think that ultimately gets to?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So on the first question, in terms of the discount rate, to the extent we are successful and continuing to drive into new categories or are able to create greater engagement of existing customers into new categories, they will, in all likelihood, drive the average discount rate down by 2 or 3 basis points a year. Over the last 3 or 4 years, it's only been about 1 basis point as we've been successful or we're historically successful at increasing price in certain categories where it was warranted based on the value that we bring. There are less of those opportunities at the moment. And that's why I think we're seeing the 2% lower discount rate -- 2 basis points lower discount rate. But again, the economics are good here. It's part of our strategy. This is something that we are driving as opposed to just happening to us at the end of the day. I actually have not really thought about where it might go net of incentives. It's not something that we have done. So that's not a statistics that I thought about quite frankly. The other thing is that as you do the calculation where you're just taking discount revenue divided by billings, you need to be mindful of GNS. So GNS is a terrific success story. It is driving additional business. It's increasing relevance of our network around the world. But as you know, in GNS, we get a percentage of the discount rates and not the full 2.5. That's impacting that calculation. It's probably the biggest impact on that calculation. But the economics of the GNS business are very good. As you know, we don't have credit risk and has very good returns on equity. So we shouldn't think about that ratio going down as a negative. It's actually, again, driven by our business strategy. And we are being successful. In GNS, as you know, we've had growth in Billed business of over 20% for the last 8 quarters. Now in terms of transactors, you're right. Back in the second quarter of '08, transactors only represented 16% and that is now up to 29%. I think that is a combination of our strategy, which we are focused on premium lending. And I think that would cause that number to go up over time. On the other hand, another very big factor is just customer behavior where customers have decided to delever. Now whether customers continue to be in that load over the long-term or whether over time, they are more willing to take on additional revolving credit. That will drive that number as well. So I think it will be both of those factors over time that drive where that percentages go. Again the important thing is that we have good economics, whether it's a customer who is spending and revolving or a customer who is simply a transactor. So now, I'll take one last question. Okay? So if we have no further questions, I thank everybody for being on the call. Thank you very much.\nRick Petrino: Okay, that's a wrap.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 7:00 p.m. this evening through October 26 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.\nRick Petrino: Thank you, Rocco. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. Before we start the slide presentation, it is my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release, which was filed in an 8-K report, and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the second quarter 2011 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, he will turn to the moderator, who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then, no one has actually registered to ask questions. While we attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will go through the slide presentation, and we'll start with Slide 2, which is the Summary of Financial Performance. So total revenues net of interest expense was $7.6 billion. That's a 12% increase over last year. On an FX-adjusted basis, it is 8%. So even after adjusting for the foreign exchange impact, we achieved our long-term revenue growth target of 8%. Income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, 27% higher than last year. EPS from continuing operations was $1.07. We also had $0.03 of earnings from discontinued operations, which was really a tax settlement related to American Express Bank. So EPS on net income is $1.10, but we'll focus on the $1.07. Return on average equity was 28%, and shares outstanding were even with last year.  So moving to Metric Performance on Slide 3, Billed business in the quarter was $207 billion, 18% higher than last year, 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the second quarter was the strongest quarter for Billed business in American Express history, both on a reported basis and an FX-adjusted basis. So record spending by our Cardmembers. On an FX basis, Billings growth has either been 14% or 15% over the last 5 quarters and 15% in this quarter. Cards-in-force grew 6%. GNS cards grew at 15% and proprietary cards at 2%. Average basic Cardmember spending increased 15% and 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, obviously a major driver for the increase in Billed business. Loans grew 2%, and it's been many quarters since we've had growth in loans. Not on this chart are accounts receivable related to Charge Card, and there, we actually had a sequential growth of 6%. So looking at worldwide travel sales, it grew 17%, 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. It was primarily driven by higher air sales, where we had both an increase in transactions and higher ticket price, although the increase in transactions was the larger contributor, and we had growth in both corporate and consumer travel. Moving to Slide 4. This is Billed business growth by segment. So we continued to see broad-based growth across all the segments. On an FX-adjusted basis, all 6 segments had double-digit growth. GNS has the highest growth at 25% on an FX-adjusted basis and over the past 7 quarters has had growth over 20%. The other segments have also had consistent growth over the last 5 quarters. If we move to Slide 5, which is Billed business growth by Region. Again, here, we continue to see broad-based growth across all regions. On an FX-adjusted basis, all regions had double-digit growth. In the past 6 quarters, all regions have had double-digit growth. So again, here, in each region, the growth has been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. Moving to Slide 6, so this is looking at lending Billed business versus managed loan growth. So the solid line is growth in spending on lending products, and the dotted line is growth in loans. And you can see on the chart that the growth in spending on lending products has not correlated with the change in loan balances over the past 2 years. Again, not on this chart, but if you were to look at Charge Card billings compared to accounts receivable growth, that actually does move in tandem. So the difference in growth between spending on lending products and loans is in part due to our actions and part due to Cardmember behavior. So our actions are that we have reduced the amount of proprietary lending acquisitions, and those acquisitions are focused on premium lending. And they tend to revolve less. We've also had a significant reduction in balance transfers. On the Cardmember side, they are simply deleveraging. So the transactors have become a larger percentage of our loan book. If you were to look at the lending trust payment rate, you would see that in June of 2010, the rate was 28.9%, and in June of 2011, it's 31.6%. So 270 basis points higher. If we move to Slide 7, this is the U.S. consumer net interest yield for managed Cardmember loans. So while this time period is no longer on the chart, if you went back prior to 2009, net interest yield was generally in the high 8% to 9% range. So rates increased in 2009 in anticipation of the CARD Act. Rates have now come down in recent quarters as anticipated. As discussed in prior quarters, the impact of the CARD Act within yield is significant. However, we have worked to mitigate it through our repricing activities. So the lower yield reflects lower revolve rates and lower balances at penalty rates, offset by certain repricing initiatives. Going forward, yield will continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including our strategy to focus on premium lending, the credit quality of our portfolio, the percentage of the portfolio that is revolving and the cost of funds. If we move to Slide 8, so this is revenue performance, you can see overall revenues grew at 12%. Discount revenue grew at 16%, driven by 18% growth in Billed business. It also reflects a slight decline in our average discount rate, the fact that GNS Billed business is growing faster than the average and we have higher contra revenue items such as corporate incentives and partner payments. Card fees are up 5%. This reflects the growth of 2% in proprietary cards, and the balance of the growth is the result of foreign exchange and the weaker dollar. Travel is up 21% on 17% increase in sales and a slightly higher commission rate. Other commissions and fees is primarily driven by loyalty partners being included in this quarter, when it was not in last quarter, or the quarter last year. Other revenues reflect higher GNS partner royalties, higher foreign exchange fees, higher prepaid revenues, greater merchant-related fee revenues, and they all contributed to the 10% growth in this line. Net interest income is down 3%, and this reflects the lower yield I just discussed, offset by the 2% increase in average Cardmember loans. So overall, we have 12% reported growth in revenues, 8% on an FX-adjusted basis, very strong relative performance. Next, to Slide 9, provision for losses, and this continues to be well below historic levels and enables us to invest to drive future business momentum. The Charge Card provision is $65 million higher than last year. Write-off rates are about the same in both periods, and therefore the write-off dollars are about the same. But in 2010, it included a $60 million reserve release, reflecting the improvement in credit metrics compared to prior periods. Credit performance in Charge Card continues to be excellent. Now lending provision, as you can see, as you'll see on the later slide, the write-off rate is down dramatically compared to 2010. Reserve releases in both periods are similar. So the reserve releases in 2010 and '11 are similar. But we have a lower provision driven by the lower write-off dollars, which are a result of the lower write-off rates. Slide 10, so this is Charge Card credit performance. So Charge Card credit performance continues to be excellent and stable and at historic low levels, both in the U.S. Consumer business, International Consumer and the Global Commercial Card business. Since our objective is to grow the business profitably and not have the lowest possible write-off rate, I would expect these metrics to pick up over time as we grow the business. Slide 11, lending net write-off rate. So the U.S. and International write-off rates continue to improve. The worldwide rate is now 3.1% compared to 6% last year. The U.S. lending credit performance is the best in the industry. The U.S. Consumer write-off rate in this quarter was 3.2% and in June was 2.7%. Moving to Slide 12, so this is the lending 30-day past due. So the 30-day past due has improved in both the U.S. and internationally. Again, this is best-in-industry performance. Again, our objective is not to have the lowest possible credit metrics but to make good economic decisions that drive profitable growth. So here, we move to Slide 13, so this is USCS managed lending roll rates and bankruptcy filings. If we look at the right side of this chart, it's the number of bankruptcies, and you can see that it's up slightly from the first quarter but well below the levels that we saw in 2009 and 2010. And I'd remind you that about 2/3 of the bankruptcies have already been written off by the time we receive the notice. Now the left side of the chart is designed to be helpful as we look forward. So if you look at the upper left chart, so these are balances that roll from current to 30 days past due, and if you look at the green triangles, those are the balances that went past due in November, December and January, and they write off 5 months later if they continue to be delinquent. So those green triangles wrote off in the second quarter of 2011. Then you can see that the 3 blue triangles are lower. The next 3 blue triangles are lower than the green triangles. So if the 30-day past-due amounts to write off, which is the chart on the bottom left, remain constant, the third quarter 2011 write-off would be lower than what we saw in the second quarter of 2011. It also assumes that early write-offs or recoveries remain unchanged. Although I would note that the 30-day past due to write-off rate, the bottom-left chart, has ticked down slightly. If we go to Slide 14, so this is the worldwide lending reserve releases. This chart shows the lending reserve releases across the top by quarter. The light-blue bar are the write-off dollars in the quarter, and the dark-blue bars is the provision. So it's the dollar write-offs less the reserve releases. So in the second quarter of 2011, the reserve release was approximately the same as the second quarter in 2010. But we had a lower write-off rate in 2011, and therefore the write-off dollars are lower in 2011, and therefore, the provision is lower in 2011 compared to 2010. The reserve release in the second quarter of '11 is lower than the past several quarters. So while credit is improving, it is at a slower rate than we saw in recent quarters. Reserve releases should diminish as we go forward. Looking at Slide 15, so this is Lending Reserve Coverage. So as credit metrics continue to improve, the reserve as a percentage of loan continues to come down in the U.S. and worldwide. In the U.S., it now stands at 4.5%, and worldwide, it is at 4.4%. Reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage have remained similar to the levels that we had in the first quarter. Although we released reserves of $400 million in the quarter, coverage ratios remain at appropriate levels. So if we look at Slide 16, expense performance. So expenses increased 21% on a reported basis but 17% on an FX-adjusted basis. Marketing and promotion decreased by 4% due to lower USCS product media spend, partially offset by higher investments in international markets, and I'll provide some additional detail on following slides. Cardmember rewards increased 35% year-over-year. So this is greater reward-related spending volumes and higher co-brand expense. In addition, we see higher membership rewards redemption rates that have led by a -- that led to an increase in the ultimate redemption rate. We also saw a shift in redemption mix which is increasing our weighted average cost per point. And I have a slide to talk to this in more detail in a minute. Salaries and employee benefits increased 21%, and this reflects higher employee levels, merit increases for existing employees, higher benefit-related costs and $48 million of severance costs related to reengineering and higher incentive-related compensation. Total expense adjusted for FX and if we were to exclude the reengineering cost would be 15%. Professional services increased 17%, reflecting higher technology development, including various initiatives related to digitizing the business, globalizing operating platforms and enhancing analytic and data capabilities. It also includes higher legal cost, greater third-party merchant service sales force commissions. And it also includes a reduction of the amount previously capitalized related to software development by third-party vendors, and that amount was $38 million. And lastly, we have a lower tax rate that reflects the favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax items. We utilized this tax benefit to invest at higher levels. Moving to Slide 17. As we discussed in prior quarters, the high level of spending reflects the benefits from improving credit and the Visa-MasterCard payments. As these benefits lessen over time, we have the flexibility to move investment spending towards historic levels. So if you looked at M&P as a percentage of revenues, it was 7% in 2007. During the crisis of 2009, it dropped to 7%. And in the second quarter of 2011, it stands at 10%. So when I reference moving to historical levels, I mean about 7% or -- sorry, 9% of revenues, or about $700 million per quarter. Spending on marketing and promotions in the second quarter was $795 million. Within USCS, we focused on Platinum and Charge Cards, Blue Sky, Blue Cash and Delta acquisitions, although we had lower product media spend. In International Consumer, we focused on acquisitions in our major proprietary markets and marketing related to loyalty partners. In GNMS, we focused on merchant spend simulation, perceptions of coverage and certain contractual and incentive payments.  So now let's move to Slide 18, Cardmember rewards expense. Cardmember rewards expense increased $1.6 billion -- or was $1.6 billion, an increase of 35%. So this includes expense related to Membership Rewards and to our co-brand products. Membership Rewards was the primary driver of expense growing beyond the growth in volumes. So I just remind you that in our co-brand products, the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the rewards to the customer. We pay the co-brand partner monthly and have no liability on our balance sheet. In contrast, we have the liability for the Membership Rewards program and, therefore, have a reserve on our balance sheet for this program. The primary point I want to make before I review the drivers of the growth in Membership Rewards expense is that the increase reflects the cumulative impact of rewards program enhancements designed to encourage Cardmembers to earn and redeem points.  So now, let's look at the drivers of Membership Rewards expense. So the first part relates to points earned in the second quarter. So we look at total spend. If the ultimate redemption rate and the weighted average cost per point in the second quarter of 2011 was the same as that in the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012, then the increase in expense would equal the increase in spending in the period. But it's not that simple. We also look at bonus points, and to the extent bonus points earned in the quarter as a percentage of total spend increases compared to a year-ago quarter, then that will contribute to expense growth at a higher rate. And that was the case in the second quarter of 2011. In addition to that, if the ultimate redemption rate or the average weighted cost in the second quarter of 2011 is higher than what we had in the second quarter of 2010, that would also contribute to a higher growth rate related to the points in the quarter. Now the second part has to do with points previously earned. So when we enter the quarter, there are points that have been earned by Cardmembers that have not yet been redeemed. And we have a balance sheet reserve for that. And the way that's calculated is really the points that have been earned but not yet redeemed times our estimate of what the URR, or the ultimate redemption rate, would be -- was at the beginning of the quarter, times the weighted average cost per point that we estimated at the beginning of the quarter. So if the estimate for the ultimate redemption rate or the weighted average cost increases or decreases, the balance sheet reserve needs to change accordingly. Now you might remember, in the annual report, we point out that 1%, or a 100-basis-point increase, in the ultimate redemption rate results in a cost of $283 million. The weighted average cost, if it changes by 1 basis point, costs $60 million. So in the second quarter of 2011, as a result of the cumulative impact of rewards program enhancements, Cardmembers are redeeming at higher levels, and we are seeing a shift in the redemption mix, which is increasing the weighted average cost per point. So in the second quarter of '11, rewards expense includes the alignment of the balance sheet reserve with the current behaviors of Cardmembers, which requires an increase in the reserve and, therefore, an increase in expense in the second quarter. So let me make a few final points. While rewards did grow faster than volume in the period due to the reserve increase I mentioned, we view the underlying increase in customer redemption activity as a positive outcome that logically follows the value enhancement that we have made to the program in recent years. Redemption's rates may continue to grow somewhat. But as we have stressed before, our customers earning and redeeming points is an encouraging sign to our business model, as rewards is closely linked with engagement and loyalty to the American Express brand. We are confident that we can continue to add value to Membership Rewards program and still maintain our current on-average and, over time, financial targets. Let me move to Slide 19, operating expense. So operating expense is total expense excluding Marketing and Promotion, Membership Rewards and membership services or Cardmember services, and it totals $2.9 billion. As we've discussed over the past several quarters, investment spending is driving higher operating expense. Operating expense grew at 21%, 17% on an FX-adjusted basis. And as I mentioned before, if you excluded the cost of reengineering, it would be 15%. So if we look at the chart, we break out those items that are growing faster than the average, which are above the dotted line and those that are growing at a more modest rate, which are below that line. So within new business initiatives includes spending on LoyaltyEdge, mobile and online capabilities building, business insight, certifying and loyalty partners. Also above the line are higher levels of investment in GNS. But as I mentioned before, GNS has been growing at over 20%, Billed business over 20% over the last 7 quarters. So our investments are paying dividends. Also, you can see we continue to invest in sales force. And we're investing in technology for both our core business and digital initiatives. Below the line, you can see that we are growing support functions and global services at more modest rates. I'd also point out that the Visa-MasterCard payments are netted in operating expense. And as you know, this quarter is the last quarter that we will receive the $150 million per quarter from MasterCard. And the fourth quarter is the last quarter we'll receive payments from Visa, which is $70 million a quarter. As I indicated last quarter, we have a plan to slow the growth in operating expense, and again, that excludes provision, rewards and marketing and promotion. So we have a plan to slow the growth in our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012. The next slide is Slide 20, expense flexibility over time. So here, we're looking at adjusted expenses, and this excludes provision. So we recognize -- so this is adjusted expenses as a percentage of revenue, but again, excluding provision. And we recognize that we are on elevated expense levels, though adjusted expense as a percentage of revenues has started to decrease. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways. First, through revenue growth, which is to be fueled in part by the investments that we have been making in 2010 and 2011, and second, through expense flexibility, which includes our plans to slow the growth rate in operating expenses, which I just discussed, as we exit 2011 and into 2012. Next, is Slide 21, our capital ratios. Tier 1 common has increased in the second quarter to 12.3%. In the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion in capital, $1.3 billion through net income and $300 million from employee plans. We used $800 million for share repurchases and had a dividend of approximately $200 million. The high level of capital is the fact that we're holding capital effectively or designed to enable acquisitions in the future. So you remember that we've said we'll return about 50% of earnings to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and hold 50% to support growth in the business that requires growth in the balance sheet and for acquisitions. If Basel III rules were in effect today, we estimate that the Tier 1 common ratio would be about 40 basis points lower than the 12.3%. So we continue to have strong capital ratios. Slide 22, so this is a liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable equity securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we're holding about $20 billion, and the next 12 months' maturities are $17 billion. Next is Slide 23, this is our U.S. retail deposit program, and you can see that direct deposits increased by $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Third-party CDs declined by about $900 million, with the weighted average remaining maturities similar to what we had last quarter at 20 months. So total deposits increased slightly to $31.6 billion. And deposits are providing a greater degree of funding diversity for us. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters. Spending growth remains strong across all business segments and geographic regions, despite difficult prior-year comparisons. We also saw a further improvement in lending trends as average loans grew year-over-year for the first time since the end of 2008 and lending credit continued to improve. Our strong billings growth coupled with higher travel revenues and miles growth in average loans enabled us to reach our long-term revenue growth target, even after adjusting for foreign exchange impacts in the quarter. Our revenue growth rate also continues to outpace our large issuing competitors, reflecting returns on our investments and the unique nature of our spend-centric business model. Strong revenue growth, improving credit trends and the benefit of lower effective tax rate provided the opportunity to invest in the business at high levels while also generating strong earnings. These investments are driving current metrics as we deliver higher average spend, grow our card base and build capabilities for the future. We are also seeing higher customer engagement in our rewards programs, which, while driving higher rewards costs, creates favorable economics through enhanced customer loyalty. We're excited about the continued momentum in the business but acknowledge that the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain. In addition, as you know, we have received the last payment from MasterCard, will receive the last payment from Visa in the fourth quarter and face more difficult year-over-year comparisons in light of the strong volume and credit performance in 2010 and year-to-date in 2011. In light of these factors, we are continuing to implement our plan to slow the growth of our operating expense as we exit this year and into 2012. Our success in a highly competitive environment and unique business model are yielding high-quality results and strong revenue growth. As spending on our network continues to grow well above industry average and our credit performance remains the best among major credit card issuers, we are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to manage through the changing environment, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace. Thanks for listening. We're now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Two questions for you. On the Membership Rewards cost, we saw that line expand over 30% each of the last 2 quarters. And from your discussion, it sounds like without the increase in the cost per point, that should track with spending. So in the third quarter, should we expect that year-on-year growth rate to start to trend back towards the growth in Billed business? Or are we going to remain at these above-30% growth level -- growth rates for a period longer? And secondly, I was hoping someone could comment on the genesis of the Facebook deal, whether that was bid for or they came to you, you went to them, so on and so forth.\nDaniel Henry: So as you know, I wouldn't forecast the third quarter. What I would say is the first quarter was impacted by a refinement in our estimation process with an element in the first quarter and why we had a growth rate that was higher than the growth in spending. The second quarter was a little different in that it was really driven by the fact that, because of the enhancements that we've made in the program, we saw more engagement, more redemptions on the part of our Cardmembers. And also, we saw a shift in redemption to some options that had a higher cost to it. So the things that drove the first quarter and the second quarter were slightly different. As I indicated, we could see the URR increase somewhat in the future, but that will be completely dictated by the behavior of our customers. And really, the key point here is that we want to enhance the program, we want greater levels of customer engagement. It creates loyalty. The economics around products that have the Membership Rewards feature on it are very good. So while engagement in the quarter causes us to align our balance sheet reserve with that behavior and, therefore, has expense in the period, long-term we think is very good for the franchise. So as relates to Facebook, we are constantly interacting with folks in the marketplace, thinking about how we can capitalize on the digital space. So this was not a bidding process. This was us looking to see how we can provide relevance and value to our customers broadly and, in particular, to small businesses. So this is all about creating value and relevance for both customers and merchants in a way that provides a positive result, both for Facebook, for American Express, for merchants and for customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I was hoping to get a sense of what's driving the strong spending volumes. Obviously, you guys have seen strong volume growth for some time now. I know part of it is FX-driven. But maybe you can just talk about how much of it is kind of new-business driven versus higher customer spend versus some commodity-inflation-related impacts. And then just on that URR question, what is the URR now versus what it was in the first quarter? And then just -- I was wondering how we should think about it from an NPV of customer relations standpoint. I mean, these higher costs, is that eating into the NPV of new relationships or existing relationships versus what you had anticipated they would be when you originated them?\nDaniel Henry: So multiple questions there. So the drivers of Billed business. So even adjusting for FX, 15% FX-adjusted growth is really very strong. It's clearly at the very top end in the industry. Based on the data we've seen so far, I would suspect we'll continue to gain share, which is one of our major objectives. It is a combination of both performance of our current customers and the new customers that we're acquiring. So while we're not seeing large percentage increases in proprietary cards, the quality of the Cardmembers that we are acquiring is really very good. So we are focused on high spenders who want to utilize charge cards. We're also focused on premium lending. And at the end of the day, we're providing a value proposition to both new customers and existing customers that are causing them to decide to spend on our products as opposed to someone else's. At the end of the day, it's a combination of the rewards programs that we've put in place and the enhancements that we have made as well as the customer service that we provide. And as you know and I said many times, J.D. Power does the survey for the industry. As relates to service, we've been #1 for several years. So I think it's a combination of all those factors and the investments that we've been making over the past couple of years that are paying off with higher levels of spend. So to move to your second question about the ultimate redemption rate, the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter we indicated was 92%. The ultimate redemption rate is also 92% in the second quarter. Now as I said, we've actually seen a tick-up in redemptions. So in the first quarter, it was 92%, but we were actually rounding up to get to 92%. In the second quarter, we were at 92%, but we're rounding down to 92%. So there's been an increase in what we have reserved in terms of ultimate redemption rate from the first to the second quarter, but they both round to 92%. The third question regarding the NPV of customers, so the NPV of customers that we're acquiring continues to be very strong. As you know, when we acquire customers, we think about not the cost to acquire them solely in this year or what their performance is next year, but it's really their performance over many, many years to figure out the economic value of that investment. And those investments acquiring the customers continue to be good. In terms of is it impacting the margins on existing customers, to the extent we are successful in putting the right value proposition out there, we avoid attrition, right? And if we have attrition, higher attrition, then we need to acquire more new Cardmembers. So the fact that these enhancements are lowering attrition has a very strong economic benefit attached to it. And as I said in my comments when I was going over the slides, we are comfortable that we can continue to enhance the Membership Rewards program and still maintain our current financial targets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: I guess not to continue to ask about rewards, but I did have a broader question, which is when we look at Cap One and Discover and I'm sure if we could see it, at Chase, it seems like everyone has rewards charges happening, or at least the 4 of you do. And it also seems like the 4 of you are all kind of now moving into double-digit spend volume growth, whereas some of the other competitors are still stuck in the single-digits or even flat. So I guess what's the risk that there's just kind of a broader industry rewards war kind of happening and the few issuers who are moving market share will just structurally have to pay more to keep it going forward?\nDaniel Henry: So there has been a war for the premium end of the payments industry for 15 years. And if we were back 10 or 15 years ago, we would be talking about people wanting to move into our space. And if we were complacent, I think we would lose share. But we're not. We continue to innovate. We continue to improve the value proposition that we provide to customers. That's a combination of rewards, Cardmember services, servicing. It's also us being cognizant that our customers want to be able to utilize the digital space more. We are very focused on that. You can see the recent announcements that we've made with Foursquare, with Facebook. I think those are all reflections of us innovating and providing value to customers. Now as we do that, it's important that we have the right business model to not only grow Billed business and grow revenues, but to have the right profitability associated to that. And again, over the last decade, I think we have continued to have the right level of profitability. And we think we have sufficient flexibility in our business model to continue to achieve our financial targets. So I think you're right, there's a very competitive landscape out there. We've been successful competing in that market, and we think we will continue to be successful as we go forward.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: If I can ask a follow-up, can you remind us where we stand on all things on the litigation front, DOJ and the Visa merchant suit? And I know there's only so much you can say on things like this, but just any progress, updates or milestones we should be watching for in the near term?\nDaniel Henry: DOJ was in the paper today as the cause, I guess, approved the settlement agreement between DOJ and Visa-MasterCard. As we've said in the past, we have provisions, non-discriminatory provisions, in our contract. We believe that if the merchant accepts American Express that when the Cardmember chooses to use that, our product, that they're not discriminated against. We also do not believe that we have market power. If you don't have market power, it's hard to see how we're driving anticompetitive behaviors. So we continue to plan to vigorously defend our position as it relates to DOJ. As it relates to the Visa merchant suit, you'd have to really talk to them about where that stands.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from the line of Bruce Harting with Barclays Capital.\nBruce Harting - Barclays Capital: Any comments on the stronger card growth rest of world versus U.S., and then if I just look at -- stack up Billed business growth by your 4 businesses versus discount revenue growth and rewards cost, it looks like percentage changed year-over-year. It looks like the stronger growth in all 3 categories is the ICS and the GCS and GNMS. And any comments on what you're seeing, if you're just allocating more marketing spend or co-brand overseas and trends there. And then just to the degree that you have your comment you plan to slow growth of expense, excluding provision marketing and rewards, will that other other expense line be -- is there anything you can say forward-looking on where to expect the 220 toward the MasterCard fee in 3Q and 4Q, where the biggest change will come?\nDaniel Henry: Okay, so that's lots of questions. Hopefully I don't miss some. So if you look at Slide 4, you're right that they are growing at slightly different growth rates, with GNS being the strongest. When we look at card growth internationally, a lot of that is being driven -- or GNS is growing cards at a faster rate than the proprietary business is growing in. I think that's a reflection of us or of our partners recognizing the value of issuing products that run on our network. Those additional cards are driving the growth in Billings that we've seen. And as I pointed out, this has been a success story over many years, and certainly over the last 7 quarters, GNS has grown greater than 20%. So I think that's a very good story. And while GNS is growing faster than the other segments, if you look at Slide 4, you can see that each segment on an FX-adjusted basis is growing in the double-digits, and they all have been doing it for 4 or 5 quarters. So I think the breadth of the growth in Billed business is encouraging and the stability of that growth is also encouraging. So even though there are slight variations, I think we're being successful across all the segments, U.S. consumer, U.S. small business, International Consumer, Commercial Card globally, they all have really very, very good growth rates. So there's some differentiation, but I think they're good. I would say that we -- and we have said that we think there is lots of opportunity in international markets. And so we have allocated more resources in terms of investment dollars to International. And we expect to get good returns on that. I think the investments we've been making broadly across the company, I think, reflect that. Also, the fact that on a regional basis, we've also had double-digit growth across all the regions, again, is encouraging because it's so broad-based. And again, we've had double-digit growth across the regions on an FX-adjusted basis for several quarters. So that's a positive. So switching to expenses and other other. So other other has the credit related to the settlement payments we receive from Visa-MasterCard. So you should expect the absence of the $150 million from MasterCard next quarter, just have that line pop up. And when we get to the first quarter of 2012 and we no longer have the Visa $70 million, it will pop up again. So as we focus on operating expense, there are lots of resources there. I think it's $2.9 billion. We're looking at the composite of that and how we utilize those resources. So we'll be looking to slow the growth in operating expense as we exit this year and go into next year. We won't necessarily be focused on each individual line item, but in aggregate, it's our goal to slow the growth rate in operating expense. So I don't know if I remembered all of your questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane from JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: When we look at the Card Billed business domestically, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, the revenue growth falls behind on both metrics. And Dan, you've made the comment that there are some contra revenue items running through there, and you specifically mentioned corporate rebates and partner payments. Can you just give us a sense of how much of that's recurring? Are these performance-driven, milestone-type payments? Are they upfront payments? Help us understand what's going on there, please.\nDaniel Henry: So I think Billed business growth in the U.S. is really quite strong and very similar to the aggregate Billed business growth. So we're not seeing domestic U.S. spending falling behind. It continues to be quite good. If you're looking at discount revenue growing at 16% instead of 18%, if you look at GNS Billings, we share some of the discount rate with our partners. So the revenues related to those Billings are lower than if we have proprietary Billings. GNS has very good economics, good profitability, excellent ROE. It just happened to have less discount rate attached to each solidly [ph]. That's one of the factors. When you look at contra revenue, whether the incentive to corporate customers or partner payments, I think the vast majority of those are volume-related. And that's the primary driver. There may be some exceptions in there, but I think the vast majority are performance-based at the end of the day. So even if it winds up with a slightly lower discount rate, it still has very good economics attached to it. So if you're looking at U.S. Card Services information in our supplements or on the tables, the revenue line says discount revenue, net card fees and other. And so you're looking at 8% growth. That's really being driven by card fees in the other revenue lines, not by poor performance in Billed business.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: So you're saying that card fees in the other lines are flattish and that the mix is driving that.\nDaniel Henry: Yes. I don't have it right in front of me, all those line items, but if you look at the consolidated numbers, net card fees are growing at 5%.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you for providing additional disclosure around rewards expense and I appreciate that. It gives us a lot to think about. When you talk about the marketing and promotion expense historically running around 9%, that was very helpful. Is there a level that we can think about in terms of rewards expense relative to Billings historically that you would consider to be the average for that mix of business at the time? And could you provide us with what the URR would be associated with that?\nDaniel Henry: So if you were to go back in history, rewards expense as a percentage of revenues would have been lower than what it is today. And in part, that's because in the first quarter and the second quarter, we've had this greater engagement by our customers and, therefore, a higher ultimate redemption rate and cost per point, that's related to the volume of those periods but also the alignment of the reserve with the most recent customer behaviors. So we have many levers within our business model that we can utilize. We can decide to acquire higher-quality customers that reduces provision as a percentage of revenue. We can decide to provide greater rewards. We could spend more money on acquiring customers utilizing MNP, we could hire more people at sales force, we could hire more people to build analytical capabilities or risk capabilities. So these are all the different ways we can use our resources, and we make decisions as we think about what our strategies are going to be and how we're going to provide value to our customers and our merchants. And we really, over the course of time, make those trade-offs. So I think going to one period and saying they're X and then try to compare them solely to another period without factoring in all the other levers that we're pulling would be kind of taking something out of context. So I think you need to look at each of these expenses as a percentage of revenue within the context of the period that you're in.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I think -- we appreciate that. I guess you were kind enough to give us the 7% or the 9% as a run rate of normal. I'm trying to baseline your rewards expense, it was 65 basis points of Billings back for pre-recession, and I'm wondering if that's not 65 basis points going forward, how we should be thinking about that. And I understand that there's lots of different levers, I'm just trying to find a baseline. And I don't know if you're just not able or willing to provide that, but that's what I'm asking.\nDaniel Henry: So certainly, there would be a percentage, a basis point you can calculate off of Billed business. And that would be a number that gradually changes. And to the extent there are periods where we adjust the balance sheet for either refinements in our estimation process or based on greater engagement on the part of our customers, in those periods, you're going to see additional expense in those quarters. And I suspect that will be the case going forward.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Just a follow-up, can you remind us how much of the revenue quarter-over-quarter was increase due to the first quarter acquisition? There was one month in the first quarter for the acquisition, and I think you've got a full quarter of revenue in expenses. Can you provide us with that detail here? And then just as we think about acquisitions going forward, of the 8%-or-better revenue growth, how much of that would you expect to be acquisition-related?\nDaniel Henry: So we have not disclosed in the quarter what loyalty partners is. What we did say is that at the time of the acquisition, that in 2010, loyalty partners full year revenues were about $300 million. So you can think about that in terms of the contribution they're making in the second quarter. In terms of the 8% target that we have and what piece will come from acquisitions, the 8% has been our target for a while. And as you know, we have not really been an acquisitive company, and we were -- had that as our target. So it all depends where you're allocating resources at the end of the day. So we don't have a specific carve-out going forward for what acquisitions will contribute. It really depends on the nature of the acquisition what the contribution will be. So I would think about 8% as something probably we can achieve from an organic perspective, and then what acquisitions contribute will be depending on the nature of the acquisition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Stilmar with SunTrust.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: To follow up, kind of, a little bit to Ken's prior question, Dan, I was wondering if you could provide for as a little bit more specificity on the path to the operating leverage that we've been discussing now for several quarters. And now as we kind of see that clearly rewards themselves are a higher cost, and although that's not part of your target for expense flexibility, I'm wondering if you can prioritize for us as we move forward how much of your enthusiasm for reaching those goals comes from purchasing higher-margin businesses, actual expense-cutting or really just top line revenue growth coming from existing platform to be able to give you that operating leverage. I'm wondering if you can kind of prioritize which is the bigger driver of the path from here to there. That would be helpful. And then following up with that, we've gotten the final rules from Durbin. I was wondering if you think about your Prepaid segment any differently today in terms of the services that you would offer and the functionality that you would attach to your Prepaid debit business post-Durbin because of some the nuances in that final bill.\nDaniel Henry: So as it relates to operating leverage, we don't plan to get there through an acquisition. That's not part of our plan. We really plan to get there in 2 ways. One is we expect that -- we've seen already that the investments we've been making have been paying off in terms of good performance in our metrics in revenue, so one way, part of it, is growth in revenues. And the other part is related to operating expense and to have the growth rate in operating expense to slow as we exit the year and as we go into 2012. So those will be the 2 primary drivers of improving operating leverage at the end of the day. As it relates to Durbin and Prepaid, I would say that -- point out that our Prepaid product is not subject to Durbin, okay. We were excluded from that. It refers to debit products issued by the banks. So Durbin doesn't have an impact on our Prepaid business. We think the Prepaid business is a very good growth business. We have a good position in that market. We've recently issued new products that, if you buy them online and reload them online, don't have any purchase fees. There's no back-end fees, there's no maintenance fees. So we think it's really quite an attractive product in a market that we believe will continue to grow. So we're pretty positive about our space there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I'm wondering if you could give us some color on trends in card spending during the quarter. Was gasoline much -- did gasoline prices have much of an impact in the U.S., and is there any change in mix outside the USA? I guess I wondered, related to that, on the increase in the weighted average cost of redemption on rewards, we're seeing presumably an increase in travel-related rewards, and is that kind of coincident with higher travel spending?\nDaniel Henry: So gas -- so I think the increase in Billed business is very broad-based, okay? I think travel is one of the components that is growing nicely, but it's really very broad-based across many merchant categories, and I think it's reflective of the fact that we have a very affluent Cardmember base, and those Cardmembers have the ability to spend and pay. I think that's a factor. As we've said other times, gas is not a big factor in terms of driving Billed business or discount rate for us. Certainly, the slight decline that we saw in discount rate does reflect a shift in where our customers are spending. As we broaden our merchant base, it's often in new categories that are at lower rates than our average discount rate. And I think the strong growth in International is also contributing to the slightly lower discount rate. But growth is very broad-based, which, again, is an encouraging sign. But in terms of weighted average cost per point on Membership Rewards, I think we are seeing a shift to travel-related redemption options. I think that's a reflection of the fact that in '09, we probably had a shift going in the other direction, where people were using rewards less for travel and more for everyday type of items. And I think as we move further away from 2009, we're seeing a logical shift back to more travel-related type of redemptions, and, therefore, it's having the impact of shifting the weighted average cost per point up.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: So the weighted average cost up from where it was in pre-2009 period, when you had sort of similar mix of travel redemptions, or the...\nDaniel Henry: So I don't have that off the top of my head, where it was pre-'09. But certainly, it's up from the most recent quarters that we had.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: It's one of the first times you've raised the weighted average cost, because you spend a lot of effort kind of providing additional redemption options to lower the average cost.\nDaniel Henry: I think we provide additional redemption items because we think many of the program participants value them highly. It does have the benefit that some of them have a lower average cost, but we're really trying to accomplish 2 things: one is the weighted average cost and providing value to Cardmembers. But you're correct that we have normally spoken about ultimate redemption rate. And the weighted average cost has had a lesser effect than ultimate redemption rate, so it was a factor, so we through it was important to mention.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: I was wondering if you can speak to what kind of the maximum is on the ultimate redemption rate. I mean, it's certainly not 100%.\nDaniel Henry: Yes, so it can't be more than 100%, and it probably, in all likelihood, won't be 100%. But where it ultimately goes to probably has a lot to do with the value that we can continue to put in the program and the enhancements we make. But it will be speculative to try to guess at where it goes to. So I'll take just one more question.\nOperator: Our final question will be coming from the line of Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Dan, just on the rewards, obviously, both URR and WAC are up. Can you give us maybe a sense of the pace of increase in the second quarter relative to what it's been in the prior quarters? Has it accelerated? Decelerated? Any additional color you can give us there?\nDaniel Henry: So the first time we disclosed the ultimate redemption rate for active employees was at the end of '07. And we indicated it was about 90%. It was pretty flat in 2008, and so we disclosed it in the annual report again, it was 90%. There was some modest increase in the following year, 2010. But there was a pickup in the pace in -- 2009, I guess, it was modest increase. In 2010, it picked up, and we disclosed it was 91%. And obviously, with the refinement in how we were estimating, URR in the first quarter popped up to 92%. So again, it is higher now than it was back in '07 or '08. But again, we view the fact that we are enhancing the program and we're getting better loyalty and engagement, from an economic point of view, we view that as very positive with very good economics. And that's the -- and it provides value to our Cardmembers. So a combination of all those things. We view the Membership Rewards program as really a very important part of our value proposition with good economics, which is I think is the key factor.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Just one last follow-up on the growth rate in Global Commercial Services. Seems like it's decelerated over the last year or so. Is there something in there? Was it the GE acquisition that drove it higher in the prior year or just something else that's causing it to trend a little bit lower?\nDaniel Henry: I don't think it's GE. I think GE is far enough back in our history that, that wouldn't be a factor. Commercial Card, generally, when recession is coming, hold out longer and then drops very quickly. But it also comes back quicker than most of the other categories. So that could have been a factor in the higher growth rate that you saw in the early part of 2010. But the growth rate, again, is double-digits and continues to be very good. And we continue to be successful in the marketplace with Commercial Card globally. So we're very pleased by the performance of Commercial Card. Okay, so, with that, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Take care.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded and information on accessing that replay will be given at the end of today's conference.  With that, I'd like to turn today's call over to our host, Mr. Ron Stovall, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRon Stovall: Okay, thank you, Dave, and welcome to everyone. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. As usual, it's my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release, which is filed on an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release and Earnings Supplement, as well as the presentation Slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings with a series of slides included in the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A period. Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions. While we will attempts to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time. Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel Henry: Okay, thanks, Ron. So let's start on Slide 2, Summary of Financial Information. So total revenues net of interest expense was $7 billion, up 7% compared to last year and that's 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Income was $1,177,000,000, up 33% from the prior year. EPS was $0.97 and Return on Equity was 28%. So revenues, while not robust, were an improvement from 4% growth in the fourth quarter and are better than what we see in the industry. Let's go to Slide 3, Metrics. Start off Billed business. The Billed business was up 17% on a reported basis, 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. So this is the fifth straight quarter that we've had Billed business in the 15% range. And the first quarter of 2011 is the strongest first quarter in Billing in American Express' history, both on a reported and an FX basis. Looking at cards-in-force, it's up 5%. We had growth in GNS of 14% and in the U.S. Consumers Small Business Group growth of 2%. Average basic cardmember spending continued to be strong at 13% growth on an FX-adjusted basis, and cardmember loans were flat basically with last year as loans have stabilized which is a positive. Worldwide travel sales is really being driven by air sales, a combination of both higher average price and a higher number of transactions. And we're seeing that both in the Corporate business and the Consumer business.  So let's move to Slide 4. So this is Billed Business Growth by Segment, and as you can see by the chart, we continue to have strong growth across all of our segments. The U.S. Consumer Small Business Group grew 13%, the International Consumer business on an FX-adjusted basis was 10%, Global Commercial Services 17% and GNS 24%, for a total of 15%.  If we move to Slide 5, this is Billed business Growth by Region, and again, as you can see on the chart, all geographies are having strong growth. In the U.S., growth was 15%; in EMEA on a FX-adjusted basis, 10%; JAPA, which is Asia, on FX-adjusted basis was 18%. Now within there is Japan and the growth rate in Japan has declined. We've seen an impact on Inbound business, but we still have double-digit growth in the Japanese market. And Latin America and Canada grew 16%.  So if we move to Slide 6, this is Lending Billed business compared to and as well as managed loan growth. So spending on lending products, as you know, is no longer correlated with the growth in loans. And this is due to the fact that we are focused on premium lending. We have significantly reduced balance transfers, and there's been a change in cardmember behavior since the recession. Now if you look at the lending trust units, you would see that paydown rate continue to increase. So in March of 2011, the paydown rate was 30.4%, and that compares to March of 2010 when it was 27%. As you can also see from the chart as I mentioned before, the loan balances have stabilized.  So next, we move to Slide 7, so this is USCS net interest yield. Now historically prior to 2009, the net interest yield was generally in the high 8% to 9% range. In anticipation of the CARD Act, we increased prices and you can see that reflected in the bars related to 2009 as well as the first quarter of 2010. As the Credit Card Act became effective, yields, as we expected, has started to migrate back towards historical levels. But in this quarter, the yield was 9.1 compared to 10% in the first quarter of 2010. So this decrease is resulting in a decrease in net interest income. So moving to Slide 8, which is our revenue performance. We see that discount revenue is at 14%, Card Billed business was at 17% and some of the factors contributing to the 14% growth was the fact that GNS Billed business is growing faster than the average as we've discussed before. Billed business on GNS is lower than on proprietary business. Also, we have a number of Contra-revenue items including corporate incentive payments, partner payments and cash back rewards, which are deductions from discount revenue. Now the discount rate stands at 2.55%, the same level as last year, which is very good. Now as we know going forward, as the mix of our billings changes to more everyday spend, we would expect the discount rate to decline. However, over the past 3 years, it's held up very well.  If we look at net card fees, you can see it's up 3%. We actually had an adjustment in the first quarter of $10 million for $11 million. So excluding that, it's relatively flat. If we look at travel commissions and fees of 18%, essentially being driven by air sales as I discussed on a prior page.  Now Other Commissions and Fees are up 6%. And here, we have foreign exchange conversion revenue increasing based on higher spend. We also have 1 month of Loyalty Partner revenue, and that's offset by lower delinquency fees. If we look at Other revenues which is up 12%, we have higher GNS partner royalty revenues, higher merchant related fee revenues, higher foreign exchange fees and higher global prepay revenues. And net interest income is down as our loans are flat and the yields that we just discussed are lower. We move to Slide 9. So this is Provision for Losses. So Charge Card, the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is the same as last year. Receivables are about 11% higher. Now Charge Card provision is a little lower here as we had a modest build in reserves in the first quarter of 2010 and a modest reduction or reserve release in the first quarter of 2011. So Charge Card, as you know, has performed very well during the recession, and now that we're in a recovery period. Now looking at lending, provision is $800 million lower year-over-year. It was $688 million in the first quarter of 2010 and is actually a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of this year. Now there are two factors. 1 is lower write-off rates and the second is the larger reserve release. So the write-off rate in the first quarter of 2010 was 7% and the write-off rate in the first quarter of this year is 3.7%. So write-off dollars in the period are about $600 million lower.  In the first quarter of 2010, we had a reserve release of $485 million and in the first quarter this year, we have a reserve release of about $700 million. So $200 million greater. So credit continues to improve, we're improving faster than the industry and write-offs are below historical levels. Next, I'll move to Slide 10. So here in the beginning, I'll basically talk to the first three columns on the left-hand side. The comparison of the first quarter of '11 to the first quarter of 2010. Now we do have total growth and expenses of 19%. And that's a combination of what I'll call business-as-usual expenses. 1 item in rewards, which I'll explain in a minute, plus we're investing to build our business momentum going forward. And that's really being enabled by the strong Billed business volumes, improving credit, as well as the Visa and MasterCard payments we received. So we can see here that marketing and promotion is up 15% year-over-year, and I'll discuss this in a little bit more detail on the next slide. At the moment, I'll skip the rewards line then we'll come back to it. Salaries and Employee Benefits increased 15%. Employees are up about 3,300 from last year or about 6%. We had an increase of about 1,400 employees compared to the fourth quarter, 600 of those relate to Loyalty Partners, then we've had increases in technologies, enterprise growth, as well as world service. It also reflects merit increases, higher benefit-related costs and increased incentive-related compensation accruals. Next, we'll look at Professional Services, which increased 18%. This includes technology consulting on development projects, higher external sales agents in Global Merchant Services, and higher legal fees, some related to the DOJ suit and some related to our acquisitions. Other is up primarily related to some accounting related to some foreign exchange and interest hedges, which I'll talk about on a later slide. The other thing I'd point out at this juncture is the fourth column, which is really showing the change in expenses in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And I draw your attention to marketing and promotion, which is actually down 15% from the fourth quarter, as well as Professional Services, which is 27% lower than the fourth quarter. So here, we see expenses trending down from where we were in the fourth quarter. So let me talk to cardmember rewards expense, which is up 27%. Though a portion of this is simply the 15% growth that we see in spending by cardmembers, the other portion relates to the Membership Rewards program. We continue to improve the Membership Rewards program and its value proposition. We've recently added a number of new redemption options, including Amazon and certain other digital redemption options. We are seeing greater customer engagement by the current program participants, which is reflected in an increase in redemption patterns.  Now as I've said in the past, higher redemptions and higher customer engagement is positive from a business perspective. Cardmembers who are active redeemers spend more, attrite less and we have a higher share of their wallet. This program is attractive from both a cardmember and shareholder perspective. We continue to refine our estimation process for the calculation of the ultimate redemption rate. These refinements are captured in the recent increase in redemption patterns by our current program participants. This resulted in our estimate of the ultimate redemption rate for current participants, increasing from 91% at the end of last year to 92% in the first quarter of 2011, which resulted in an increase in the MR reserve of $188 million. Going forward, we will continue to refine the ultimate redemption estimation process as cardmember behaviors in the program evolve. So next, I'll move to Slide 11. Now here, we continue to have high levels of marketing, which again has been enabled by strong cardmember spending, improved credit and the Visa/MasterCard payments. And while the first quarter of 2011 is lower than the fourth quarter of 2010, we are above historic levels and 15% higher than the first quarter of 2010. The areas we're spending on in the U.S. Consumer Small Business area are acquisition of charge and premium lending cardmembers, and loyalty investments including partners payments. The International consumer is focused on acquisition and loyalty spend stimulation, and in Global Merchant Services it's a combination of contractual merchant payments, merchant loyalty spend, perception of coverage and brand advertising. Moving to Slide 12, so here we're going to discuss a number of investments that are recorded in operating expense. Operating expense, which are basically excluding marketing and rewards, increased 16%, 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. And we can see that support functions in global services are growing more slowly than the average.  Now above the average are 3 bubbles that are growing as a function of the investments that we're making to drive future business momentum. So we look at the upper left, we see new business initiatives. And here, we're focusing on driving fee revenue. It includes investments in LoyaltyEdge, online and mobile, Accertify, Loyalty Partners and Business Insights. If you look at the next item, it's sales force investments, both in Commercial Card and the Merchant business. If we look all the way to the right, we see variable technology investments, and these are technology investments to develop technology solutions in both our core business as well as our digital advancements. Now there are two other bullets, 1 simply has to do with spending for bank holding company in Basel II regulatory requirements, the other has to do with accounting for our debt and FX hedges. Now here I may give you more information that you actually want, but our FX hedges are functioning as designed. So what we want to do is basically lock in our U.S. dollar net income.  So in the first quarter of 2011, the U.S. dollar weakened. As a result, revenues and expenses are higher, therefore, net income in higher. And in this case, we actually pay on the hedge, and so it's an expense. In the first quarter of 2010, the opposite happened. The U.S. dollar strengthened, therefore we reported lower revenues in expenses and therefore net income. In that case we actually received the payment, which is a credit on this expense line. The other item is our hedge on our fixed rate debt where we convert, have a hedge that converts the fixed rate debt to floating. And again, this hedge is functioning exactly as we intend. Accounting requires us to mark this to market. So in some periods, we have an expense, some items we have a credit. So again here in 2011, we have a debit, last year we had a credit. Now these mark to marks at the end, net to 0 and so there's no economics to it. I went through this long explanation because a combination of these things actually had a negative year-over-year effect of $50 million. So now, moving to Slide 13, so this is Expense Flexibility Over Time. So these are expenses excluding provision and they're expenses as a percentage of total revenue, net of interest expense. Now we recognize that we are currently at elevated expense levels, and again, this is being funded by improved credit and Visa/MasterCard payments.  Now that it's likely that the benefit in credit provision from credit reserve releases will diminish going forward, and the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments will phase out in the second quarter, those are the MasterCard payments which are $150 million per quarter, and the fourth quarter, which are the Visa payments of $70 million a quarter. As result of that, we are, as a go-forward, we're moving forward with plans to slow the growth in our operating expense toward the end of this year and into 2012. So we would expect this percentage to move down as we go forward. So next is Slide 14, so this is Charge Card Credit Performance, and here we can see that USCS write-off rates are the same in the first quarter of this year as they were last year. In International Consumer and Global Commercial Services, we can see that they've been pretty consistent over the last several quarters. The higher amount in the first quarter of 2010 reflected a refinement in the calculation. So we would expect these metrics to pick up somewhat over time as we continue to grow our business. Moving to Slide 15, Lending, Net Write-off Rate. So here, both the U.S. and the international write-off rate continue to improve. And as you know, our write-off rates started to improve before the industry. And as we said, we moved sooner in terms of credit actions. Our actions have been very effective, and we have a higher quality base. So our write off rate is now at 3.7%, the lowest in the industry. So the write-offs in the first quarter were $541 million, which is about $500 million lower than what they were in 2010. So moving to Slide 16, this is Lending 30-day Past Due, and you can see that we continue to have improvement in both the U.S. and it has stabilized in International. These are at historical lows. So I'd point out that our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate for 30-day past due levels, but to make good economic decisions to drive profitable growth. So Slide 17 is a slide we've looked at in terms of helping us think where we're going, going forward. Here I'd start on the right-hand side. So you can see that the number of bankruptcies are down notably in the first quarter for us. And this is consistent with the trend seen in the industry. Regarding bankruptcies, I'd also point out that the average dollar amount of each bankruptcy has been decreasing and approximately 2/3 of all bankruptcies reported to us, we've already written the account off. So now, looking at the chart on the upper left, and we've used this in the past year or so to be helpful. So here, if you look on the upper left chart and look at the green triangles, so these are the balances that rolled from current to past due in August through September of 2010. And they were write off 5 months later if they remain delinquent, until they wrote off in the first quarter of 2011. Next to that -- next to these, the green triangles, if you look at the next 3 blue triangles, they are lower than the green triangles. So if the 30-day past due write-off to write-off which is on the bottom chart remains constant, an early write-off to recoveries are unchanged, the second quarter 2011 write-offs would be lower than the write-offs we had in the first quarter of 2011. The other item that I'd point out on this chart are the next 2 blue triangles, which are the last 2 blue triangles are flat with the prior triangle. Flowing at the bottom chart, the 30-Day Past Due to Write-off rate, so through March, this past due write-off rate remains pretty consistent with the recent prior periods.  Let me go now to Slide 18. So this is a new chart, it's Worldwide Lending Reserve Releases, and if you look across the top, you'll see the amount of reserve releases, the dollar amount of reserve releases, each quarter. And this indicates that in the first quarter of 2011, we released $700 million. Now if we look at the bars, the light blue bars are the dollar amounts of write-offs in their respective quarters. The dark blue bars are provision. So it's write-offs less reserve releases give you provision. So it's important to realize that the improvement in provision has built in the combination of lower write-offs and the reserve releases. So if you use the first quarter of 2010 as an example, you can see that the write-offs were about $1.2 billion, reserve releases were $500 million. And so the provision was about $700 million. And that ties back to Slide #9. If we look at the first quarter of 2011, we actually have a credit in lending provision, and that's because the reserve release of $700 million is larger than the write-offs in the quarter which were approximately $600 million.  We would expect the write-off rate to remain below historical levels in the near future. Although I would note that if you went back to the first quarter of 2010, our reserves for loan excluded $5.3 billion. And at the end of the first quarter of 2011, it's $2.9 billion. So going forward, we would expect reserve releases to diminish. If you go to Slide 19, these are lending reserve ratios, coverage ratios. And as credit metrics have improved, our lending reserve coverage has started to come down, and you can see that in U.S. Card as well as Worldwide. Reserves, as a percentage of past due and principal month coverage have also ticked down. And although we had reserve releases of $700 million in the quarter, our reserve coverage remains at appropriate levels. Next is Slide 20, Capital Ratios. You can see our Tier 1 common is 11.8% compared to 11.1% in the fourth quarter. So this increase is primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets. So it reflects the seasonal change in loan balances which have declined, as well as there were certain cash that was considered restricted cash in the fourth quarter but is now free cash. Those are the 2 main drivers. These ratios continue to be strong. Now I would point out that we do not plan to maintain the Tier 1 common ratio above 11%. Our target is to have it between 10% and 11%. I'd now hear that we plan to restart our share repurchase in the second quarter. Now if the Basel III guidelines were implemented in the first quarter of 2011, we would estimate that it would reduce our ratio by about 80 basis points. And that compares to an estimate we had in the fourth quarter of about 50 basis points. And that shows really or finally in the calculation that we made as we continue to gain a broader understanding, and quite frankly, some of the factors quarter to quarter will change.  So moving to Slide 21, our liquidity snapshot, we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities, which is our stated objective, then we're somewhere above that in the first quarter, and that's because Personal Savings, our direct deposit program, actually was somewhat stronger than we expected.  Now we can see that on the next slide, Slide 22, so this is a summary of our U.S. Retail Deposit Program. And you can see that the direct deposits increased by $3.4 billion in the first quarter. And you also see that third-party CDs declined by $1.9 billion. And on those CDs, the weighted average remaining maturity is about 19.5 months. Now we don't expect direct deposit growth to continue at this level over the balance of the year. In fact, what happened is we kind of got stuck in the 1 or 2 position on the rate tables, which is not where we want. However, we have sent out marketing materials and when others dropped their rates, we didn't want to drop our rates right on the heels of sending out marketing materials. We have moved our rate down on the highs from 1.3% to 1.5%. And if needed, we will continue to move that rate so that we are not in the first or second position. Deposits now total $31 billion. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect a continuation of the positive business trends, evident during last year. Spending growth remains strong across all business segments and geographic regions despite increasingly difficult prior-year comparisons. We also saw further improvement in lending credit trends, some of it is due to our strategic and risk-related actions and some reflecting the post-recession behavior of customers. But the versions between consumer spending and borrowing levels continues to illustrate this change in behavior, as well as our shift in focus to a more premium lending customer. The net effect of all these factors is an improvement in the risk profile of the overall company. Revenue growth, which continued to improve in the quarter, but still is below our long-term target, continue to outpace our large issuer competitors as strong cardmember spending volumes more than offset the impact of lower loan use. As expected, our strong billings growth and improved credit trends once again provide the opportunity to invest in the business at high levels, while also generating strong earnings. These investments continue to be focused on driving current metrics and building capabilities that will benefit the medium to long-term success of the company. 1 example of a longer-term initiative was the recent launch of Serve, our next-generation digital payment platform. While many investments are reflected in marketing and operating expense, others involve using our strong capital base such as our recent Loyalty Partner acquisition and the Payfone equity investment announced last week. Despite strong momentum across our business, the economic and regulatory environment remains uncertain.  In addition, as you know later this year, we will stop receiving the quarterly Visa and MasterCard litigation payments. And year-over-year comparisons will be more difficult in light of the strong 2010 credit and volume trends. In light of these factors, we are moving forward with plans to slow the growth of our operating expenses toward the end of this year and into 2012. The bottom line is our strong competitive position and unique business model are yielding high-quality results. As spending on our network continues to be well above industry average and our credit performance remains the best among the major card issuers. We are confident that our investments and business model are appropriately positioned to manage through the changing environment, capitalize on the opportunities in front of us and continue to win in the marketplace.  Thanks for listening, and I'm now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Craig Mauer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: First, let me congratulate Ron on completing his final earnings release.\nRon Stovall: Thank you, Craig.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Moving onto the hot topic which is expenses, a couple of questions there. If we were to add in the $220 million contra expense item regarding the settlement payments to the other expense line, will this quarter represent a good run rate for that line, as it seems this is about where you were running prerecession on average on a quarterly basis? And also if you can just help us with a little flavor in terms of going into next year, you talk about moving the expenses as a percentage of managed revenue ratio back down toward prerecession levels, I mean what type of move can we think about for next year, with the understanding that this is a multiyear effort?\nDaniel Henry: Okay, so I think that some of the elevation in operating expense is going to continue. So to the extent we have investment in sales force, that will continue at that level and we think it will generate revenues that make it a worthwhile investment. Our investments to build teams that enable projects like Business Insights or enterprise growth, again those are expenses that will continue going forward and will be supported by the revenues that they would generate. Now there are some investments that we elevated, particularly in the technologies area, which are projects that have a very finite life to them. And we wouldn't necessarily see those at the levels that we've seen over the last several quarters. So I think we will calibrate our expenses and be mindful that when some of the resources we currently have, such as the release of credit reserves and when the payments of Visa/MasterCard come to an end, that we have expense levels that are appropriate for our revenues and as I said, we would expect expense growth later in the year to scale down and slow. So it's kind of a combination. Some will continue, but others will decrease as we move forward.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: So specifically, in the Other Revenue line, were we at a good run rate there concerning the settlement payments of contra expense and I guess in a slightly different fashion, if we think about the reserve release slowing that you talked about and the reduction in spending that would be commensurate with that, is that I mean should we look for reduction in HR? I mean, where are we looking for that reduction is what I'm trying to get at.\nDaniel Henry: I guess, I would look at operating expenses, kind of line items together. So I'll look at expenses, exclude provisions, obviously, exclude marketing, exclude rewards. If we exclude those, those are the operating expenses that I'm addressing. And I'm not specifically saying that you're going to see a decrease in that line item. I think there will be a decrease in certain elements of that line item. What I'm saying is you're not going to see the growth rates on that line that you've been seeing over the last several quarters. But not necessarily a decrease. A decrease in certain items, but not necessarily a decrease when you look at operating expenses in total. If that were the case, as we move through the year, the growth rates will decline.\nCraig Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.: Okay, thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: When we look at the rewards expense, it's basically a function -- the growth rate is a function of 3 things: It's the Billed business growth, whatever you do, whatever incentives you're providing or programs you're running during the quarter, and then in this quarter, getting change in assumption on the long-term redemption rate. Going forward, the way I'm thinking that we should model this and correct me if I'm wrong here is that we should see a really, at least on the margin is a function as the growth in the Billed business, that the change in assumption this quarter, the incremental somewhere between $165 million and $185 million was a one-time event?\nDaniel Henry: Generally, you would expect rewards to grow in line with Billed business unless we are increasing certain programs. Now so I think it's reasonable to expect rewards to grow with business, okay? However, what I would say is that we continue to refine our estimation process around the ultimate redemption rate. And to the extent either cardmember behavior changes or we evolve the program in such a way that we're increasing redemptions, in those cases, we would expect to see increases in expense when we identify those. So I think on an ongoing basis, we're always looking at our estimation process and continue to refine it as appropriate. I would point out that this line is both a combination of Membership Rewards, as well as our co-brand products. The other element that you didn't mention when you think about expense in the quarter is volume related to Membership Rewards. It's volume, it's the ultimate redemption rate and it's the cost per point. And cost per point during some periods will increase depending on the mix of redemption by customers. And in some point, it could decrease, again based on their behaviors or new redemption options that we put into the program. So that's the other factor that you need to keep in mind.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: If I could have just 1 quick follow-up. Is the test for the redemption rate a quarterly test or is that something you review annually?\nDaniel Henry: It's a quarterly test.\nRichard Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Great. Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Next we'll hear from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Just wanted to shift to the capital ratio comment that you had. You indicated a comment Tier 1 10% to 11% was really more in line with where you'd like it to be for your long-term goal. Are you anticipating any type of timeframe to get there? Is that something that you're targeting by year end?\nDaniel Henry: So I would say our target of 10% to 11% is where we are, absent further guidance from the regulators. When they finally come out with their rules, depending on where it is we may modify that. But in the moderate term, I would say it's 10% to 11%. This ratio will obviously move based on the matter of share buybacks we do. We could have periods where a certain amount of cash, we're required to take certain cash prior to the redemption of certain securitization and put it into restricted cash. The extent that happens, those type of things could impact the ratio in the short-term. If you think about share buyback, you should really think about the guidance we've given that we basically want to return about 50% of our earnings to shareholders either through dividends or share buybacks, plus we would have buybacks equal to the amount of capital that's raised through employee plans.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: But you indicated too that the ratio could be declined by about 80 basis points or so from your current 11.8%. Did I hear you right?\nDaniel Henry: Someone made the predictions that we're going to drop about 80 basis points next quarter. I'm just saying our moderate term target is between 10% and 11%, right. But that moment we happen to be at 11.8%, next quarter, we're going to have -- moving our balance sheet, we're going to have our share repurchases and we're going to have earnings. Whatever the composite of that is, is where we'll wind up. This could be above 11% or it might be in the 10% to 11% range.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: And you indicated your buybacks to start next quarter through this quarter so you're not waiting for anything from the Citi buffer. You also at one point indicated that you didn't think you were systemic risk bank does that assessment still hold?\nDaniel Henry: So we have heard back from the Fed, which had no objection to our plan that we submitted. We are certainly one of the 19 large banks in the U.S. although to the extent there are global significant banks, we don't believe we are 1 of those banks.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Okay, got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I had a question on the ultimate redemption rate change again. I'm just trying to understand how much of that change was a conscious decision for greater engagement versus some kind of structural change in the competitive environment. Could you just help us think about that, because all if equal, it would seem like you'd have less discretion to spend money elsewhere. And obviously, you're looking to take expenses down. So maybe you could just talk about that and then just how does the current redemption rate assumption track what your assumption is?\nDaniel Henry: So I don't think there is any structural change in the competitive environment. I think we have continued to look to enhance the value proposition of Membership Rewards to the extent we're successful in doing that. We're going to have greater cardmember engagement, to the extent we have greater cardmember engagement, we're going to have higher redemption levels. So I think as you think about how we deploy our resources, we do make conscious decisions about the amount we're going to allocate to rewards versus marketing, how much we're going to have in loyalty programs or acquisition of customers. So all of those things are similar levers and we make conscious decisions about in terms of how we're going allocate our resources at the end of the day.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: And then just on the redemption rate tracking currently tracking to your expectation?\nDaniel Henry: So the ultimate redemption rate is going to be based on cardmember behavior and we do a quarterly calculation where we're endeavoring to estimate what we think the ultimate redemption rate is going to be. If cardmember behavior changes, the estimate will change. And at times we do refinements of the estimation process, and that will result in potential changes as well. So it's a combination of all of those things that impacted the rate in this quarter and will impact the rate of the quarter going forward.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Dan, I hate to go back to cardmember rewards, but was there a step-up function this quarter like one time in nature such that you have like a build of the reserves, such a that it would start correlating a lot more of spending more towards the point made earlier? Or should we start thinking about this at a similar level relative to growth and discount revenue?\nDaniel Henry: Okay, so what the expense is in each quarter is a function of spend, ultimate redemption rate estimate and the weighted average cost per point. Those are the elements that drive expense each quarter, okay. The weighted average cost per point, we actually use the weighted average of the last 12 months as the best estimate for that, okay. Spend is going to be whatever our cardmember spend in a quarter. If the average weighted cost per point and the URR does not change for the quarter, then rewards should grow equal to the growth in Billed business, okay. In this quarter, we refined our methodology, and it resulted in a increase based on the behaviors of our customers in the ultimate redemption rate estimate from 91% up to 92% for our active participants, okay. So each quarter, it will be the same process that I just described.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: One other final thing, as you talked about expenses and potentially the growth rate of expenses changing, but you also referenced expenses relative to operating margins. Sort of commensurate with the revenue growth that you're anticipating from the investment spending. And in some of your prior presentations, you alluded to getting back to kind of pre-recession operating margins or certainly things that we've been talking about. Is that still a stated goal and what is kind of the timeframe for us to be thinking about that stated goal that we had in the past?\nDaniel Henry: So I think on average and overtime perspective, I think we want to be at historical margins. It's not a state objective, but I think that's basically where we want to get back to. Now the actual mix of expenses within those margins could change. We could decide to increase the amount that we allocate to or that we target for marketing promotion, or we could target to take that down. We could decide that from an overall perspective, the best thing to do is to increase the value proposition in our rewards programs. And then that would become a larger perspective -- a larger percentage, rather. So I think we're constantly looking at that and calibrating it to achieve the right returns on our investments and the right financial performance on average and over time in line with our stated objective of 8% plus revenue growth, 12% to 15% EPS growth and ROE of 25% plus. So those are all things that we use to calibrate the decisions that we make.\nJohn Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Do you have a target for when operating leverage will turn positive?\nDaniel Henry: So, just if you can tell me exactly what that calculation is?\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: So revenue growth exceeding expense growth on a year-over-year basis. I'm just trying to piece together, we've got operating expense slowing, we've got marketing budget which I guess is fairly discretionary, we've got presumably the rewards expense growing in line with discount revenues. But just when will that revenue growth line start exceeding the expense growth line? Is that also something that we could expect to happen at the end of this year and into next, or will that be different because of the trajectory of rewards and marketing?\nDaniel Henry: So I wouldn't do a forecast of revenue growth or expense growth going forward, although I would go back and say that the targets that I just alluded to in terms of EPS growth, which are on average and overtime, I think we've said that 2010 is a good base to think about in terms of achieving those targets on average amount of time going forward. So that would give you an idea of what our expectation is, both for revenues, as well as for EPS growth.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: And then just a cleanup question on tax rate, is the tax rate we saw this quarter what we should expect over time or what should we use as a long-term tax rate.\nDaniel Henry: I think our rate was 31%-ish, 32%? Okay, so I think we've said on average over time again, we would expect the tax rate in the 30% to 32% range. In particular quarters, there may be discreet tax items that would cause it to either be lower or higher, but that's about the right range, we should expect, 30% or 32%.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: I'd like to second the congratulations for Ron. I appreciate your help over the many years.\nRon Stovall: Thank you very much.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: The first question I have is you're obviously seeing the lending side of the equation stabilize much earlier than others. And I'm interested if you could give us any context as to what is supporting the balances stabilizing at these levels. Is it new card acquisitions that are coming in with balances, is it purely just more spending. Could you give us any context for what's driving that superior performance relative to the industry, please?\nDaniel Henry: Okay, so we are focused from a card acquisition perspective on charge cards and premium lending. So I think the nature of the customers we're acquiring is reflective of that strategy. And so they tend to be customers that may be more transactors in nature, may revolve to a lesser degree than customers did historically. I think you're seeing that in the pay down rates that I alluded to before. In March of this year, we're up about 30% compared to paydown rate of 27% in March of 2010. So I think we're having high quality acquisitions. Those customers are spending, you can see that. And the whole, I think, our customer base as well as others are tending to de-lever. And I think all of those things are coming into play. As you said, our customers, when recession was at its height, at the beginning of 2009, pulled back sooner, even though they had the capacity to spend and pay, they were cautious. Now those customers have come back very strongly. We saw our improvements in spending by our customers really move to very strong levels in the first quarter of '09. That's continued. And I think it's really the nature of our customer base, the quality of our customer base that it's causing us to move in advance of the rest of the industry on spending, on credit behavior, as well as from loan balances. Now the other thing you have to remember too is, we've changed strategy, we're not looking to balance transfers as a way of bringing customers on board, we're not using fees or rates. That's another thing that's coming into play. So I think what you're seeing on the loan side is very much a function of our strategy. Now how customer behavior will change over the next 24 months, we will have to wait and see. But I think all those things come into play in terms of what we're seeing in the loan balances.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: And as a follow-up, I don't want to beat the expense horse to death, it's pretty obvious that got a lot of flexibility in terms of how you manage expenses over time. What is a little less predictable or a little less manageable is really on the revenue side. And I'm wondering if you could give us any perspective on how you are looking at the investments that you have made, if you're feeling that the returns in terms of the revenue opportunity is coming in either in-line or better or worse than in-budgeted. Or how are you thinking about these investments if you can give us any context around when we would see the revenue side?\nDaniel Henry: So I think you are already seeing the revenue side. I think we're very pleased. We have, over the last 5 quarters, said we want to invest in part to drive near-term metrics. And in part to build capabilities that will enable the success of the company over the moderate to long-term. So when you look at our Billed business growth of 17%, I think that's a very clear reflection that the investments that we're making in cardmember acquisition and in our loyalty and rewards program are paying off. And those growth rates are not only terrific on a absolute basis, they're notably better than the rest of the industry. So I think that's very positive. I think the investments that we're making in terms of fee businesses, businesses that will generate fee revenues, I think we're making good progress there. We're pleased with the results to date. Investments in the digital space, Serve is a very good example. And we bought Revolution Money in January of 2010. We invested in building the capabilities over the next 15 months. We launched Serve in March of this year. We'll continue to build out the capabilities of Serve. So I think there are very tangible indications that our investments are paying off. Now revenue growth is 7% again. It's really the best in the industry. Now it is being impacted by the fact that loans are flat but they stabilize. So that's good. Our yields is at 9.1%. It's down to 10% last year, but we knew that. We expect that as the Card Act came in, that's exactly what would happen. Notwithstanding that, it's putting a drag on revenue growth. So we're cognizant of that, but there are a lot of very positive signs related to both the strategy that we put in place, the investments we've made, the execution on those investments and then the resulting positive output.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I wanted to ask two separate questions. As a follow-up to, Dan, you're just prior comment about the fee-based business making good progress. I think you said in the public forum that you were targeting, generating, I can\u2019t remember if it was $3 billion or $4 billion in revenue from those initiatives. Are you still comfortable with those targets? That's the first question. And then separately, I was wondering if you might be able to provide us an update on the DOJ litigation.\nDaniel Henry: Okay. So our target for $3 billion in fee revenues has not changed. And as I said, I think we're making good progress on that front. So there's no change there. As it relates to your second question, the main development on the DOJ front is that there was a hearing on March 2, and we had a schedule of discovery in terms of document discovery, expert discovery, filing of briefs and arguments. And the final pretrial conference is scheduled to be held in February of 2013. Now obviously, any of the parties could ask for an extension if they had good reason for that. But that's the update in terms of the schedule related to DOJ. I guess I'd also point out that despite that DOJ suit being out there, our relationships with merchants continue to operate in a very business-as-usual form. We continue to renew contracts, you can see by the discount rate that it continues to hold at 2.55%. So we view those all as a very positive aspects as we think about really the strength of our network, which is helping to enable the spend of our customers.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from the line of Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Dan, I just have a question on how we should think about revenue growth. So 7% year-on-year, you're pretty close to I think with your long-term target of 8% is. How should we think of it in terms of relative to Billed business? Because the gap is pretty wide. Should we expect that gap to narrow over time for Billed business to remain slightly higher than your revenue you grow over time? And then also if you could just remind us with respect to the overall economy, if you think that you can achieve sort of your long-term targets under current conditions or if you really need a pickup in GDP.\nDaniel Henry: Yes, I guess what I would say is that if GDP is around 3%, I think in normal conditions that we would be able to achieve our revenue target on average in over time. In this current environment, because we're coming out of a recession and the fact that we have a decrease in yield, that's a drag on the percentage on an aggregate basis. And I would look to fee businesses to help to contribute to the growth in revenues as those investments start to kick in. As you know, anytime we -- as I know, any time we make kind of BAU kind of investments in card acquisition, we have a very good ability to estimate what we're going to achieve. Anytime we do something new, which is some of what we're doing in the fee revenue space, and with Serve, there's a higher degree of execution risk. But we have, as I said before, we're making good progress in this area and I think fee revenues over time will be a contributor that enable us to achieve the revenue growth in excess of 8%. And if you look back over the last 10 years, we've been very successful with our investments. So we have taken share every year since 2002 through 2008. There's a slight dip in 2009, but we have very good share gains in 2010. So that's really another thing that's been contributing to our ability to outperform the marketplace. So again, we achieved 7% revenue growth in the quarter, with 0 growth in loans and a declining yield. So I think our ability to achieve 8 plus percent in revenue growth, assuming a reasonable economy, which I described as GDP of 3%, is very achievable.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: One last point of clarification on the capital ratios, when you say 10% to 11% Tier 1 comment, are you talking in terms of Basel III?\nDaniel Henry: So I've been talking really in terms of our current calculation. But even if we went to Basel III, it was 80 basis points lower. Based on our current numbers, we would be within that range. By the time Basel III actually comes into effect, hopefully we'll actually have specific guidance in terms of where the Fed would expect us to be. So we'll refine that more as we get the final rules and we get closer to the Basel III implementation. But certainly, we have terrific earnings power to create free cash flow. This quarter, we had $1,177,000,000 in earnings. Our dividend is only about $200 million. So we'll be showing off almost $1 billion in capital in the quarter. So if we needed to increase that percentage in a given period, we have a lot of wherewithal to do that.\nMichael Taiano - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Macquarie.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Dan, you had previously mentioned, apart from the $3 billion target in for fee-based revenues by the end of 2014, you previously indicated that in 2009, you generated about $800 million in fee-based revenues. So that suggests that you're expecting roughly a 30% compound annual growth rate over that period. Can you tell us what the 2010 fee-based revenues were?\nDaniel Henry: It's that number that we've disclosed. We will give I think some disclosures on this as we go forward. I don't think this is a straight line from $800 million to $3 billion, right? I think it requires heavy investment which we're doing right now in the first part of that period and then we'll get escalating results as we move through the period. So I don\u2019t have a specific disclosure on that, but I would say we're making good progress.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Okay, so there's no number that you can share for 2010?\nDaniel Henry: Not at this time.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Okay. And then just for a perspective so we kind of understand as we're moving forward, can we expect at some point to get kind of more granular insight into how each of the various fee businesses are doing as they kind of contribute to that overall target?\nDaniel Henry: So I think it would be fair as we move over the course of 2012 to '14 to figure out what the right disclosures are as an indication that we're actually making progress against our targets of 2014.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: And finally, if I could have just 1 last follow-up. There have been some concerns that some investors have expressed about your ability to continue to be able to command premium pricing on Amex spending in light of the relatively lower economics that the Serve product will generate. Can you just talk to that point and just discuss how you intend to handle any potential merchant pushback and different pricing for these different products, particularly at the time of contract, the renegotiation?\nDaniel Henry: Well I think these are two separate products, right? I mean as you think about it, our current products, our charge cards and lending products, and we have a certain set of economics attached to those. I think maybe that the customers that the Serve product will attract are people who today use cash or debit or prepaid. And those transactions will attract the different discount rate. But those are very different products meeting different customer needs. And I think merchants will view them as different in nature. So I think they both will operate, they both will meet the needs of customers in the marketplace but they're different customers. That's not to say that some of our current cardmembers may not decide to open up a Serve account, but I think they'll use them in different ways. So we'll see how the economic model evolves within Serve, but we don't think that it will create any additional pressure with merchants. I think with merchants for our charge and credit products, we negotiate with them all the time when contracts are renewed, and we agree on pricing based on the value that we bring to them over our network.\nBill Carcache - Macquarie Research: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Just to clarify I guess on the revenue side, I guess on the loan growth, you're 25% of revenue net interest income. This quarter is down 9% year-over-year. The margin really fell off in the second quarter. So I mean the comparison you established, slight bit of a low growth in 2Q '11 possibly or flat or slight loan growth, but you'll have pretty flat margins. So that by itself, probably gets you over the 8% revenue growth target?\nDaniel Henry: Well I'm not going to forecast what's going to happen in the second quarter, but certainly to the extent the yields, year-over-year start to equalize, which is going to happen in the very near future, that will be a factor that will be less of a drag on revenue growth that was last year or in this quarter. So I think that's a fair observation.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: And elected Loyalty Partners, what is the revenue of Loyalty Partner's into the one-month you had and what is the annual run rate, throughout the...\nDaniel Henry: So I think what we said is that last year, it was about $300 million. So you kind of use that as a guidepost in terms of what revenues in this quarter were.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Just 1 big expense item, and I....\nDaniel Henry: 1 month with Loyalty Partner in this quarter.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: And just 1 expense item, I know this is built into your 12% to 15%, and you have flexibility. But the comp expense is up 15% year-over-year, employees up 6%, and some incentives, I mean were there some unusual -- I mean we shouldn't expect comp expense to grow at a level that would be much above the employee growth rate, should we?\nDaniel Henry: Well I think in the normal course, you would have employee growth and you'd have year increases. I think that's what you think about as normal growth. In this particular quarter, the instance of compensation accruals we're making in this quarter are higher than the ones we made in the first quarter of last year, and there were just some other employee-related benefit items that grew at a slightly higher rate.\nRobert Napoli - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And it comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Dan, I was just wondering if you have a better sense of what the impact of CFDA might be on your business. And also if you hearing anything on the merchant settlement, it might indicate that they're moving towards credit interchange reduction?\nDaniel Henry: Well first, in terms of the CFDA, we have to wait and see. There's been a lot of discussion about exactly what they'll do until they're actually up and operational, which I think happens in the summer and they actually name the person who will leave that organization, we would know that. While we are certainly staying in close contact to the discussions in that area. So that's something that we'll have to just wait and see. Now as it relates to the merchant settlement, I guess not sure exactly which merchant settlement you refer to. So if you're referring to the Visa and MasterCard?\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: There's been some concern that as part of outside of a monetary settlement, there may be a business practice change with respect to credit interchange. I was wondering if you've gotten any indications that it might be moving in that direction or give any concerns around that.\nDaniel Henry: So I would say we don't really have any insights in terms of the Visa and MasterCard talks that they're having. So I can't shed any light on that.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc: Sure, thank you.\nDaniel Henry: Okay, so just before we end, as a couple of people have mentioned, Ron Stovall is retiring in 16 days. If you're sitting here, you could see him smile. So Ron has extraordinary knowledge, has been a terrific advocate for the company, but in a very balanced way, I think we're very happy about that. So I want to thank him for his significant contributions that he made. And I think you, the investment community will actually be in good hands going forward as Rick Petrino is taking leadership of the Investor Relations group and Toby Willard who has been a key part of that team and doing a traffic job will continue. So I congratulate Ron, but I have full faith in our team that we'll continue to be able to be responsive to your questions and your needs. So thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Welcome to the American Express Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.\nRichard Petrino: Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our Q4 discussion again. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1, 2 and 3 2012 Form 10-Q reports already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for the prior period that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick, and I'll start on Slide 2. So this is the fourth quarter summary of financial performance. So revenues came in at $8.1 billion, up 5% both on a reported and FX basis. If you exclude the $93 million of cardmember reimbursements that are contra-revenues, revenues would have grown 6%. Net income came in at $637 million. That's $0.56 of EPS. If you exclude the restructuring charge, MR reserve and cardmember reimbursements that we discussed last week, adjusted EPS would be $1.09. ROE was 23%. If you adjust it for the same 3 items I just mentioned, it would have been 26% for the fourth quarter. And you can see shares are declining, reflecting our repurchases. Moving to Slide 3. So this is a reconciliation from net income of $637 million down to income of $1.2 billion, which relates to the $1.09. So the first item here is the restructuring charge, and restructuring is part of staying ahead of the curve. It is designed to contain operating expenses and free up resources for growth initiatives. Our core business results continue to show the benefits of growth investments we've made over the last several years. We have increased share in a very competitive U.S. industry, improved risk management capabilities and introduced innovative products. We believe these fourth quarter actions will make our cost structure leaner and more efficient. Our aim is to grow operating expense less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014, freeing up funds to reinvest back into the many growth opportunities we have across the business, be it our core products, prepaid or mobile. Next is the Membership Rewards expense related to the refinement in the estimated ultimate redemption rate in the U.S. And third is cardmember reimbursements for issues that go back several years. The line items in the statement of income that these items are reflected on is clearly laid out on a chart in our 2012 fourth quarter earnings supplement. Moving to Slide 4. So this is the only slide we have on full year 2012. You can see revenues came in at $31.5 billion, up 5% or 6% on an FX-adjusted basis. Net income was $4.4 billion. That relates to EPS of $3.89. If we were to adjust for the items that I discussed before, adjusted EPS would be $4.40. And you can see the lower shares reflect the repurchase of 69 million shares during the year and the issuance of 10 million shares under employee plans. Moving to Slide 5. So these are our fourth quarter metrics. So billed business was $235 billion in the fourth quarter. That's up 8% from last year or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. In the third quarter, reported growth was 6% or 8% on an FX-adjusted basis. So billed business growth, very similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter. And our billings growth continues to be toward the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors. Cards-in-force and average basic cardmember spending growth also are similar to the third quarter. We grew proprietary cards 3% in this quarter. Cardmember loans growth was down slightly from the 6% we had in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 6. So this is billed business growth by segment. Total FX-adjusted growth moved from 8% in the third quarter to 7% in the fourth quarter. GNS, the yellow line, has moved up slightly to 12% on higher growth in Latin America. Global Corporate Services, the green line, moved down slightly to 6% growth as T&E spending grew more slowly than total billings growth. In the upper right hand, you can see that full year, we had billed business of $888 billion. Moving to Slide 7. So this is billed business growth by region. The U.S. growth slowed slightly from 8% to 7%. The other regions are either stable or growth was up slightly. JAPA, the green line, is up slightly. Australia's growth rate stabilized in the fourth quarter, and Hong Kong growth was stronger. EMEA, the blue line, also is up slightly, driven by higher growth in Germany and the U.K. Moving to Slide 8. So this is worldwide managed loans. The bars reflect the dollar amount of loans in each quarter, and the line is the growth rate. We now have several quarters where we've had growth around 4%, slightly down from 6% in the third quarter. So we are seeing growth in loans driven by our billed business growth. We are not using 0 balance transfers to grow loans. If you look at our competitors, November year-to-date, 73% of consumer acquisition mail offers included a 0 balance transfer offer. So in the fourth quarter, growth on spending on lending products was 9% while loans grow 4%, and we continue to see excellent credit quality. Moving to Slide 9. So this is revenue performance. So total revenues grew at 5%. You can see that in the bottom right, 6% excluding the cardmember reimbursement, some $93 million which were contra-revenues. Starting at the top of the page, discount revenue grew 6%, reflecting 8% growth in billed business, partially offset by a decline in discount rate, the impact of cardmember reimbursements and higher contra-revenue items, including cash rebate rewards. Net card fees reflect an increase in proprietary cards and higher average fees per card related to our premium products in U.S. Consumer and International Consumer businesses. Travel commissions and fees decreased 2% due to lower transaction-related revenue. Business travel sales declined 1%, while U.S. Consumer travel sales increased 9%. Other commissions and fees are up 5%, and that growth primarily reflects higher revenues at Loyalty Partner. Other revenues grew 4%. We had a larger gain on ICB shares in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year, although the fourth quarter gain on the ICB shares was similar to what we had in the third quarter. And we also had higher network partner fees in GNS. Net interest income increased 7%. Average cardmember loans are up 5%. Worldwide net interest yield is at 9.1%, up from 8.9% in 2011. The impact of cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter this year is why it is lower than the third quarter rate of 9.3%. Net interest yield also benefited from lower funding costs. Next, moving to Slide 10. So this is provision for losses. And here you can see that provision in the fourth quarter of this year is higher primarily because of a small build in reserves in 2012 compared to reserve releases in the fourth quarter of 2011, and you can see that on the bottom of this chart. Charge card provision decreased 11% compared to last year. We had a lower reserve build of about $19 million this year compared to a $50 million reserve build last year. This is partially offset by higher receivable levels of 5%. And the write-off in both periods are about the same. So basically, the lower charge card provision relates to a lower reserve build. Cardmember loan provision increased $247 million. This reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year, a reserve build in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $12 million compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of last year of $265 million, which was partially offset by lower write-offs this year. Write-offs this year were $346 million, and that compares to $386 million last year. So again, the change in the reserve is primarily driven by reserve releases last year or we had a slight build this year. So provision is going up while credit metrics remain stable, and you'll see that on the next several slides. So Slide 11 is charge card credit performance. And on the left chart, you can see the U.S. consumer write-off rate has ticked up and down slightly over the past several quarters. But I would view this as basically stable over this period. On the right side, you see the International Consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio, and the same thing is this is stable. So for charge card, relatively stable metrics over this period. And these are all historically -- at historically low levels. Next, going to Slide 12. So this is the lending credit performance. So these metrics also continued to be stable. You can see on the left-hand side the write-off rate has ticked down slightly, but it's basically stable over this period. In December, the U.S. managed lending write-off rate was 2.1%. The 30-day past due improved slightly in the quarter, but again is basically stable over this period. These metrics are also at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rates but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest. Slide 13. So these are our lending reserve coverage metrics. So you can look at reserves as a percentage of loans, reserves as a percentage of past due and principal months coverage in both the U.S. and, at the bottom, worldwide. These metrics are all very similar to what we saw in the third quarter, and we think they're appropriate given the risks in the portfolio. So next is Slide 14. So this is looking at expenses now. So total expenses increased 18%. You can see that on the bottom right. However, if you exclude the 3 items mentioned on Slide 3, the restructuring, the MR reserve and the cardmember reimbursements, adjusted growth in operating expense would be 3% and for total expense would be 2%. Marketing and promotion is 2% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011 but remain at very healthy levels, as you'll see on the next slide. Cardmember rewards increased 27%, primarily driven by the $342 million expense related to the refinement in the ultimate redemption rate estimate in the U.S., and I'll discuss that in 2 slides. Excluding this item, adjusted expense grew 2%, a slower growth rate than spending on MR products, partly due to a lower weighted average cost per point in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2012. Total operating expense increased 15%. However, when you adjust for the fourth quarter 2011 Visa proceeds and the fourth quarter of 2012 restructuring and cardmember reimbursement charges, the growth rate is 3%. Now in most quarters, we have small reengineering charges that we don't separately highlight. If you were to further adjust the fourth quarter of 2011 for its restructuring charge of $49 million, the adjusted growth rate is 5%. I will discuss the operating expense line in a few slides. Moving to Slide 15. So this is marketing expense. So marketing expense was $722 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to $735 million in the fourth quarter of '11, down slightly but still healthy. On the left side, you can see marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues on an annual basis. Our objective is for marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues. On the right side, you can see the percentage by quarter. In the fourth quarter, the percentage was 8.9% of revenues, and it varied over the quarters in 2012. But as you can see for full year, it was 9.2%. This level, we believe, can drive our business momentum. So next is Slide 16. So this is a historical look at the ultimate redemption rate for current enrollees worldwide. While we have refined our estimate prices -- process twice in the past 4 years, the primary driver for the higher ultimate redemption rate is higher cardmember redemptions as we have enhanced the program. A data point that supports this is that at the beginning of 2009, 45% of U.S. current enrollees had made at least one redemption. That percentage, so the number of current U.S. enrollees that have made at least 1 redemption, has increased to approximately 60% at the end of 2012, a clear reflection of the increased redemption behavior by current enrollees. Next is Slide 17. So this is operating expense, and you can see in the bottom right that it increased 19%. Excluding the restructuring reserve, the impact of cardmember reimbursements in operating expense for the fourth quarter of '12 and the Visa litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of 2011, adjusted operating expense was 3%. Now if we look at salaries and benefits, it increased 24%. But excluding the $369 million of restructuring reserves that resulted in expense on this line, adjusted expense was flat with the fourth quarter of 2011. Professional services, occupancy and equipment and communications all grew modestly. Adjusted other net increased 38%. If you exclude the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements from this line, adjusted expense increased 21%. This increase reflects a litigation-related reserve release, or basically a credit, in the fourth quarter of 2011 as well as an impairment of a cost method investment in the current quarter. Overall operating expense adjusted growth was 3%. Moving to Slide 18. So this is operating expense growth over the past 9 quarters. The green line is the growth in operating expense. The blue line is growth in revenues. And the dotted green line is operating expense, excluding litigation settlement proceeds, and in the fourth quarter of 2011, the restructuring reserve and cardmember reimbursements on the line. So I'll make several points. The growth rate in 2010 and early 2011 was a result of our strategy to invest in the business utilizing credit releases and the settlement proceeds. In 2012, we stated our objective was to grow operating expense at a pace slower than revenue growth. Adjusting for the items I just referred to, we were successful at this in 2012. This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense. Our aim now is to grow operating expense at an annual rate of less than 3% in both 2013 and 2014. The 2012 operating expense, excluding the restructuring charge, will be our base. Looking at Slide 19. So these are expenses as a percentage of revenues. So this is adjusted expenses. And in this case, by adjusted, we mean to exclude credit provision. So on the left side, you can see 5 years of history. On the right side, you can see the past 5 quarters. In 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2012, the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements that are in the fourth quarter of 2012. The adjusted percentage in the fourth quarter is 70% and 71% for the full year of 2012. As you can see, in 2012, we made substantial progress reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through revenue growth; and second, our plans to contain operating expense growth. Next is Slide 20, capital ratios. You can see that the tier 1 common ratio is 11.9% at the end of the fourth quarter, down from 12.7% in the third quarter of 2012. We generated $700 million in capital in the quarter, $600 million from net income plus $100 million from employee plans. We distributed $1.2 billion in capital, $1 billion in share repurchases, and this is in line with our capital plan and our 2012 CCAR submission, and $200 million of dividends. In addition, risk-weighted assets increased seasonally as accounts receivable and loans increased in the quarter. Tier 1 common ratio of 11.9% keeps us at -- with very strong capital ratios and well-above required benchmarks. Next is Slide 21, which is our total payout ratio. So this is the percentage of capital generated returned to shareholders. On the left-hand side is the past 5 years. On the right side, the 4 quarters in 2012. Our share buybacks and dividends were in line with our capital plan and 2012 CCAR submission. We continue to make [ph] strong capital ratios while buying back 4 billion of shares in 2012 and currently paying a $0.20 dividend per share per quarter, and dividends in 2012 totaled $900 million. Moving to Slide 22. So this is a liquidity snapshot. Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. You can see that the funding maturities are $6.6 billion (sic) [$16.6 billion], and excess cash and securities were $6.1 billion (sic) [$16.1 billion] at 12/31/2012. So we were $500 million shy of our objective, and this is a result of accounts payable decreasing faster than we had forecasted, therefore consuming cash. By the first week in January, excess cash and securities exceeded the funding maturities over the next 12 months. We continue to have a strong liquidity position. Slide 23. So this is our retail deposits by type. And you can see that we increased direct deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter to $19.4 billion, and total deposits increased $2.7 billion in the quarter to $39.7 billion. The increased deposits funded in part the seasonal increase in higher accounts receivable and loans on our balance sheet. We continue to be committed to increase direct deposits over time. Next is Slide 24. So this is a chart that shows ABS and unsecured debt issuances over the past 3 years and an estimated range of potential issuances in 2013. This is in line with our funding strategy to maintain a diversified funding profile. So we will continue to use both ABS and unsecured funding channels, in addition to retail deposit program, to meet our refinance and business growth needs in 2013. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. While our fourth quarter results were impacted by 3 items, we feel that the trends in our business metrics are indicative of the underlying strength of our business. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the uncertain economic environment. In the quarter, spend growth continued to be healthy in a very uneven economy. Fourth quarter billings growth rates were relatively consistent with the prior quarter despite the negative impact of Hurricane Sandy. Our billings growth continues to be towards the upper end of the range among our large issuing competitors. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpaced the industry, leading to 7% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates remain near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 5%, up slightly on a reported basis from last quarter, and consistent on an FX-adjusted basis. The growth reflects the impact of a weak economic environment but is still significantly better than many other issuers. Excluding the items disclosed last week and last year's Visa settlement payment, adjusted operating expense increased by 3% in the quarter versus the prior year. We continue to focus on controlling operating expenses as evidenced by the restructuring program announced last week. We are now aiming to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next 2 years, and we will seek to use a portion of the savings to reinvest in the business. We will measure this off of the 2012 base that excludes the restructuring charge. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks in line with the authorizations under the 2012 CCAR submission. Our capital ratios remain strong and, despite the impact of the 3 items in the quarter, are generally higher than forecasted in our 2012 capital plan. Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. So thanks for listening, and we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll open the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Dan, can you talk about whether you're seeing any evidence of competitors pulling back on their investment spending, particularly with the benefits from reserve releases having largely abated and the large bank issuers still not really seeing any balance growth?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think, Bill, if you look at card mailings really in this quarter and last quarter, they're down from where they were earlier in the year. What other investment actions they're taking, we don't have great visibility into. I would comment on that we continue to be very focused on operating expense, so that we can have additional resources to invest in the many opportunities we have, both in our core business and mobile and across all of our businesses. So we can -- remain very focused. And actually quite frankly, part of the reason for our restructuring charge was to stay ahead of the curve and to ensure that we had the resources we need to invest in the business, even though it's a relatively uneven economy.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: So just to make sure that I'm interpreting that correctly. So is the way that you're thinking about the travel services restructuring, is that kind of a source of funds that's going to allow you to continue to invest in better growth opportunities in other areas? And then maybe along that -- along with that, if you could also talk about your pecking order of investment opportunities and how attractive you see them today versus, say, over the course of the last couple of years, how they've changed?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So this was not solely a business travel restructuring, right? I think business travel is a large piece of the restructuring, but the restructurings are also taking place in our servicing operations. And we are having other reductions in staff groups, basically areas that are not generating revenues. Business travel is an area where we are restructuring. It's an important business to us. It's an important adjacency to our Corporate Card business. It allows us to deepen our relationships with Corporate Card clients. And so while business travel hasn't been a significant generator of revenues for us, we do continue to look at ways continually to reengineer the business. The reason that we've taken a bigger step in business travel as far as restructuring is that we now have a new leadership team in place who proposed turning up the dial on our reengineering efforts in response to the changes that we're seeing in the business landscape. And we decided to implement their proposal. But that's not the only place that we're reengineering. We do it on a regular basis. And we have done really a terrific job in our servicing areas to improve quality, as you've seen, where we continue to win the J.D. Power award, and at the same time, adopt to changing in the marketplace. So we've invested, say, in the ability to take remittances electronically. Over 80% of our remittances are received electronically in 2012. Many people are changing the way they want to interface with us. So for instance, we've invested in apps to allow people to communicate with us either through smartphones or tablet servicing applications. In fact, we had contacts through those 2 means increase to 5 million apps downloaded 5 million times compared to 2.6 million times in 2011. So we're constantly reengineering both in business travel, in the servicing and in other parts of our business.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. If I may ask one last question here, can you give a sense of what percentage of your volumes comes from customers who would be directly impacted by the threshold -- the new threshold limits after the tax law changes?\nDaniel T. Henry: So it's hard to say. The last time we saw a large tax increase was back in '93. At that time, there were a lot of other things going on, but we didn't see an impact on volumes in that period. Back in '93, billed business grew at 10% and in '94, 13%. Now it was truly a different economic environment, and GDP was more in the 3% to 4% range, but we didn't see it have an impact then. The other thing that I'd point out is U.S. consumer is an important part of our business, but our business is very diversified. We have large Corporate Card business, large international business. We have GNS partners around the world. So it's hard to predict what, if any, impact we're going to have from the tax law change.\nOperator: We will open the lines of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just wanted to clarify if I could. The expense base, if you took the $23.141 billion of total expenses, backed out the $802 million charges in the fourth quarter, that's your base, you'll grow by less than 3%?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I have to look at the numbers...\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just looking at Page 6 of your...\nDaniel T. Henry: The only thing that we're going to back out, we're going to take operating expense as we define it on our slide for the year. And we're going to back out the $400 million restructuring charge. That's the only adjustment we're going to make. And then going forward, we will compare to that number.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And also the rewards charge, the cardmember rewards charge too, yes?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So this is not -- so when you look at this, it's not marketing, it's not rewards. It's just the -- if you were to look at Slide 17, the -- this is what we're defining as operating expense. So in this quarter, it's $3.7 billion. I don't know what the annual number is. But I think the annual number, as defined here, and subtract the $400 million restructuring charge, that will be our base.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then, I mean you returned over 100% of capital generated this year, and your tier 1 common of 11.9%. Would you anticipate being having the flexibility as excluding -- assuming you don't make acquisitions, to do something similar? And what is your target tier 1 common?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we have said our target is 10%. We have been above that level for the past couple of years. So at the moment, we're staying [ph] in the range that we are today. We have not completed our Basel II work, that will not be done for some time now. And we want to see whether there's any impacts that come out of that. We need to complete that work. And at that juncture, if there were no impacts, we would probably tend to take it down from where it is today. So from a target perspective, that's how we think about it. This year, we returned 98% of capital to shareholders. I think in our CCAR submission, we will have a similar philosophy that we had this year that if we're not utilizing the capital to support growth in the balance sheet for acquisitions, that we will be inclined to return it to shareholders. And the fact that we have a very strong capital position is helpful on that. I think it's also helpful that last year when the Fed did their stress analysis, we didn't see our capital ratios drop anywhere near what the other -- many of the other banks did in that review. So I think all those things contribute to having the type of flexibility that we want from a capital perspective.\nOperator: We will open the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I just had a big-picture question. I was wondering if in this type of macro environment, you guys think you could hit your on average and over-time targets, because it seems like we might be in this environment for a little bit.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I think that when we set our target of 8% revenue growth, we assumed it was a normal economy with GDP at the 10-year average, which is 2.7% or so. At -- GDP at 2%, it becomes difficult to hit the 8%. Discount revenue is 50% of revenues. And while our billed business has held up, performed well in this environment compared to competitors, this is a pretty good linkage between GDP and what our growth rates have been. Over time, if you look at real GDP, our growth rates have been between 3x and 4x that number. So if we have billed business growth in the high-single digits, then hitting 8% overall growth becomes a challenge. So in this quarter, we did have good growth in card fees. It was up 6%. We did have good growth in net interest income, up 7%. And some of our other fee business lines had mid-single-digit growth rates. So we'll strive to be a growth company in a slow-growth environment. But achieving 8% is challenging with GDP in the U.S. where it is.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I guess just one follow-up. I mean you guys are kind of returning a little bit more capital than your target suggests as well, and you do have some operating leverage kind of levers. Could you just speak to that as it ties into that discussion?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, we always are open to acquisitions. Although as you know, we've achieved our growth and the share gains that we've experienced over the last several years through organic investments, and likely that'll be the major driver. We remain open to acquisitions if the right one comes along with the right returns. Certainly, the extent that we're able to increase our operating leverage and control operating expense, then that frees up more investment dollars to put into the many opportunities that we have across our business, and that could help to generate additional revenues as well. This quarter, we actually saw Loyalty Partner, which was an acquisition, start to contribute to revenue growth. The other thing is that the share buybacks that we're doing are giving us good improvement in terms of reducing the shares outstanding, and that gives us a lift in our EPS calculation. So we balance all those things against each other as we go forward.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill.\nChristopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: One question on the previously stated goal of getting to $3 billion in fee revenue by the end of 2014. Does anything change with last week's announcement related to some of the cardmember issues there, or also just as you commented previously a moment ago about the economic environment makes some things more challenging?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I don't think any of the items that we identified last week will affect our ability to do fee revenues. Certainly, regulators across the industry are looking closely at all products that are offered to cardmembers. I think we're going to continue to look at opportunities to expand services that we offer to cardmembers and merchants. At this juncture, we don't have a plan to change our $3 billion target. We are about halfway through the time frame and still think it's appropriate, although I would say that $3 billion is an ambitious target given the uneven economy. And there's a lot of work to do, but we're moving forward on a number of fronts. I think Loyalty department is a good example of building fee services. I think the early returns that we're seeing on Bluebird in the reloadable prepaid space is another example where we think we can be successful. So certainly, the economy does have an impact, but we're going to continue to see if we can grow fee services as we go forward.\nChristopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: Okay. And then just one question about your comments about the tapping into rewards by cardmembers that, back in 2009, only 49% had regained rewards. If I take a glass half full perspective, that seems to me to suggest that you might have had a newer cohort of cardmembers back in 2009 who hadn't just gotten to the point where they did redeem rewards. Is that the wrong way to think about it or...\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think -- so it was 45%.\nChristopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division: 45%, sorry.\nDaniel T. Henry: I wasn't clear. That's okay. I don't think that our cardmember base has changed radically. Obviously, we've added a fair number of cardmembers since 2009. I look at that increase as an increase of engagement of the people who are in the program. And I think that increase in engagement is heavily influenced by the enhancements that we've made to the program, expanding the options people have, giving people the opportunity to redeem with fewer points or using Pay with Points. So I think those are all things that have contributed to the increased engagement, of the number of people who have redeemed. And I thought it was useful just in terms of thinking about another data point that demonstrates that it is the higher level of engagement that's driving the URR.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I think as you've indicated, obviously the restructuring is going to help you at least slow some of the growth of OpEx. But you'll look to take at least some of those benefits and reinvest it, I guess, presumably in marketing and promotion. Can you talk about how those potentially offsetting factors might impact the pace at which you revert to that longer-term ratio of expenses to manage revenues of 68%, 69%?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think -- so that percentage includes both marketing rewards and operating expense. And I think we want to be focused on operating expense growth levels and achieve our target of less than 3% growth over the next 2 years. We're going to take a piece of that and reinvest it back in the business. So that could be marketing and promotion, or it could be on the operating expense line as well, depending what we think is going to give us the best return. But it will be a piece of what we save, what we reinvest. And therefore, I think it'll actually continue to increase the leverage in this calculation and enable us to continue to head back to where we were. So part of it is to help with leverage and part is to enable higher levels of investment.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Is that 69% level realistic for 2013?\nDaniel T. Henry: 60...\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: 69%?\nDaniel T. Henry: I'm not sure what the 69% is.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Of the -- your expenses to manage revenues?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I don't think we've set a target for next year. We were at 71% for the full year of 2012 and at 70% in the fourth quarter. So if we're successful on operating expense, you might expect that to decrease. I don't think we disclosed an exact amount. Certainly, it wouldn't take us all the way back to 67%, but I think we can continue to make progress towards that goal.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no other questions in queue.\nDaniel T.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 and Q2 2012 10-Q reports, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2012 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides including -- included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. And I'll start on Slide 2, the summary of financial performance. So total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7.9 billion. That's an increase of 4% from a year ago. On an FX-adjusted basis, that's 5% growth. If we look back to the second quarter, reported revenue growth was 5%; FX-adjusted, 7%. So there's a slightly lower growth rate in revenues in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Pretax income was $1.9 billion, 9% growth. Net income came in at $1.3 billion or 1% growth. So net income is growing at a slower pace than pretax income, and that's due to a lower tax rate in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted EPS came in at $1.09. That's an increase of 6%. So EPS is growing at a faster pace than net income due to our share buyback program. Return on equity is 26%, slightly above our target of 25%. And shares outstanding decreased by 4%, and this is also related to the share buyback program. So moving to Slide 3. These are the third quarter metrics. Billed business came in at $220 billion. That's 6% higher than the quarter a year ago, 8% on an FX-adjusted basis. If we compare that to the second quarter, in the second quarter, we had reported billed business growth of 7% and 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. So the third quarter billings growth rates were slightly below the second quarter by approximately 100 basis points, which seems consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry. Total cards in force grew 6%. That's a growth of 2% in our proprietary cards, which is consistent with what we've seen over the last several quarters, and a growth in GNS cards of 13%. Average basic cardmember spending grew at 4%, and this is reflective of strong customer engagement. Cardmember Loans came in at $61 billion. That's a growth of 6%. In the second quarter, we had growth of 4%. If we move over to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by segment. And we see a slight decline across each segment in terms of growth rates. If you look at GCS, the green line, which is Global Corporate Services, it previously had a growth rate above the company average over the first half of 2012, and it has declined at a slightly faster growth rate to move more towards the industry average. And we've seen this slower growth rate primarily in T&E categories. If you look at Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region. And again, here we see a slight decline across each region, although a slightly faster decline in JAPA. And within this segment, we saw a slowdown in the growth rate in Australia, and that's having the largest impact on that region's growth. If we move to Slide 6, so this is a new slide. The bars are the dollar level of loans in each quarter, and the line is the growth rate in loans compared to the prior year quarter. So while Cardmember Loan growth rate has gradually increased over the past several quarters, loans at $61.8 billion this quarter are well below the peak levels of $77.1 billion that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loan growth of 6% in the second quarter compares to 8% growth in spending on lending products. If we move to Slide 7, so this is revenue performance. And if we look at total revenue growth, which is in the bottom right-hand corner, came in at 4%. That'll be 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. If we compare that to the second quarter, reported revenue growth was 5% or 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. So this quarter, we are growing slightly -- at a slightly slower pace than in the second quarter. Discount revenue is driven by a 6% increase in billed business offset by higher contra-revenues, primarily cash back rewards. I also note that the average discount rate decreased slightly to 2.53%, and that compares to 2.54% in the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012. And as we've discussed before, it's being driven by pricing initiatives, mix and volume pricing. If we look at net card fees, increased 2%. And this growth matches the growth in cards in force. If we look at travel commissions and fees, it decreased 3% and is reflecting a 6% decline in worldwide travel sales, again reflecting lower T&E spending. Other commissions and fees declined 4% but was flat on an FX-adjusted basis. Other revenue is up 8%, and it primarily reflects a $30-million gain on the sale of ICBC shares. Net interest income growth was 6%, reflecting a 4% increase in average Cardmember Loans and slightly higher net interest yield. Moving to Slide 8, provision for losses. So the provision increased by $230 million. At a high level, we are seeing lower reserve releases partially offset by lower write-offs. So looking at Charge Card provision, it increased 9%. So this reflects a growth in receivables of 6% compared to last year. Credit metrics, as we'll see in a minute, are relatively stable. We had a reserve build in the third quarter of this year of $17 million, and that compares to a $27-million release last year. So modest changes in reserves. Cardmember Loan provision reflects loans growing 6% compared to last year. The delinquency rate is flat compared to the second quarter, and we continue to see declines in the write-off rate leading to a reserve release in the quarter. But as you can see on the slide, reserve releases this quarter of this year were $88 million compared to $421 million in the third quarter of 2011. So this has the effect of increasing provision year-over-year. And it was partially offset by lower write-offs. Write-off dollars in this quarter were $328 million, and that compares to $427 million in the third quarter of 2011. So provision is increasing while credit metrics are either stable or improving. If we move to Slide 9, so this is the Charge Card credit performance. And on the left, you can see the U.S. consumer charge write-off rate. They ticked up slightly in the first quarter of this year but have now ticked down slightly this quarter. I would view this as stable performance over the last several quarters. The right chart is international consumer and Global Corporate Services. As you can see on the chart, the net loss ratio is stable. And also note that these are historically low credit metrics. If we move to Slide 10, this is lending credit performance. And on the left-hand side, you can see that lending write-off rate continues to trend down in the quarter. Within the quarter, each month was basically stable at either 2% or 1.9%. Our view is that we are at or near a low point for the lending write-off rate. Our 30-day past due billings percentage trended down slightly in this month to 1.3%. And as I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but to achieve the best economic gain where we make investments. These metrics are at historic lows and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. Moving to Slide 11. This is our lending reserve coverage. And so for both the U.S. and worldwide, reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as write-off rates and 30-day past due rates improve. Reserves as a percentage of past due have trended down as well for the same reason. Principal months coverage have ticked up a bit, primarily due to the low level of write-offs in the quarter. We think reserves are appropriately stated based on our credit reserve models. Looking at expenses, Slide 12. So if you look at total expenses at the bottom right, total expenses are 2% lower than in the third quarter of last year, and that'll be 1% lower on an FX-adjusted basis. Adjusted to exclude litigation settlement payments of $70 million in the third quarter of 2011, expenses would be down 3%. I will cover the individual lines on following slides, but I would note that our effective tax rate is at 33% this year compared to 28% in the third quarter of 2011, when we realized certain foreign tax credits. Moving to Slide 13. So marketing expense on Slide 12 indicated that marketing expense was $764 million in the third quarter of this year compared to $757 million in the third quarter of 2011. So that's only a 1% increase. So you could ask a question, is that a sufficient increase in marketing to drive our business growth? In fact, we have high levels of spending in both quarters. You can see marketing as a percentage of revenues in this quarter was 9.7%. We have indicated that we think marketing at 9% of revenues will enable us to drive business growth. So we are investing at healthy levels to drive future growth. If we move to Slide 14, so this is cardmember rewards expense. So cardmember rewards expense, as set forth on Slide 12, in the third quarter of this year was $1.496 billion. And that compares to $1.565 billion in the third quarter of 2011. So rewards expense is 4% lower than it was a year ago. As you can see from the chart, this is a combination of higher expense in the third quarter of this year related to higher MR rewards earned in the current period and higher co-brand expense -- that's the blue section of the bar -- but lower rewards expense related to the change in MR liability for points previously earned. So the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2012 is lower than the increase in the URR in the third quarter of 2011. The net of these factors is lower rewards expense in this quarter compared to a year ago. The increase in the URR in the third quarter of this year is more in line with historic levels. The higher increase in URR in the third quarter of 2011 resulted from increased redemptions in that period. So let me remind you that for co-brand products, the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward. We pay the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability. On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Reward program and have a balance sheet reserve, which was approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011. So let's move to Slide 15, and let me remind you how the 2 elements of MR expense are calculated each quarter. So at the top, for points earned in the period, we took a look at total spending on products with the Membership Rewards feature, as well as any bonus points related to that spending, and we multiply it times the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average cost per point calculated for that quarter. The second piece is expense for points earned in previous periods. And when we have a change in the ultimate redemption rate or the weighted average cost per point, we apply those to all points outstanding at the beginning of the period. And that's the green portion of the bar. And it happened to be a small amount in the third quarter of 2012. Now while -- as we have said many times, rewards and loyalty programs continue to be a major competitive advantage for us. They drive billings, they have significant positive impacts on credit quality, and they result in closer, longer-lasting relationships with our cardmembers. We periodically evaluate the process for estimating the ultimate redemption rate and refine this process from time to time in response to changes in cardmember behavior and other factors. We currently have a review of our U.S. ultimate redemption rate estimation process underway. This review should be completed by the end of the year and will likely lead to a fourth quarter charge. As you know, our current ultimate redemption rate is 93%, a very high assumption for any consumer loyalty program. As with any such program, there are always going to be some breakage when participants leave the program without redeeming all the points they have earned. And as I said, the review of our ultimate redemption rate estimation process is not yet complete. I don't have any estimate to offer you today, but I did want to let you know that we have this process underway. Moving to Slide 16. So this is operating expense performance. And as you can see in the lower right-hand part of the chart, operating expense in the third quarter of this year is 2% lower than the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted to exclude the litigation settlement, it would be 4% lower than the third quarter of 2011. So this is clearly delivering on our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues. Looking at salaries and benefits, it is lower by 5%. This is benefiting slightly from FX, and in the third quarter of 2011, included higher reengineering costs. Our employee count this year is consistent with our employee count in the third quarter of last year. You can see that professional services are flat. Occupancy and equipment is up 5%, reflecting higher data processing costs. And adjusted other is lower as a result of expense related to legal exposures booked in the third quarter of 2011. Now in this quarter, we established incremental reserves for customer refunds within adjusted other net, as well as several different revenue P&L line items. These reserves were not the primary driver of year-over-year variances in any of the single P&L line items that they hit. Earlier this month, the company announced that we had reached settlement with several regulatory agencies. Reserves were established in prior quarters for a substantial portion of these fines and estimated cardmember refunds. We are continuing our own internal review and also cooperating with regulators in their ongoing examination of add-on products in accordance with an industry-wide review. Let me move to Slide 17. So this is a new slide. We used it at the August Financial Community Meeting. So the green line is the growth in operating expense, the blue line is the growth in revenues, and the dotted green line is the growth in operating expense excluding litigation settlement payments. So let me make several points. The growth rates in 2010 and early 2011 were the result of our strategy to invest in business utilizing reserve releases and the settlement proceeds. In 2012, we stated our objective to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years. In the fourth quarter of '11 and the first and second quarter of 2012, excluding the settlement proceeds, we grew operating expense slower than revenues. This quarter, adjusted operating expense and reported operating expense are lower than they were in the third quarter of 2011 and are growing slower than revenues. This demonstrates our ability to effectively control operating expense. Moving to Slide 18. So this is expense as a percentage of revenues, and it shows adjusted expense. Adjusted expense excludes credit provision. On the left-hand side, we see 5 years of history, and on the right-hand side, the past 5 quarters. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top line revenue growth; and second, through expense flexibility, which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth. Moving to Slide 18 (sic) [Slide 19], capital ratios. Tier 1 common ratio came in at 12.7% this quarter, which is similar to where we were in the second quarter of this year. We generated $1.4 billion in capital this quarter, $1.3 billion from net income plus $100 million from employee plans. We distributed $1.2 billion in capital, $1 billion in share buybacks and $200 million in dividends in the quarter. Risk-weighted assets increased somewhat due mostly to higher accounts receivable and loans. Our Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks. Moving to Slide 20, the total payout ratio. So this is a percentage of capital generated return to shareholders. The left side is the past 5 years, and the right side are the past 4 quarters. Our capital distribution plan allows for up to $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012. Over the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased $3 billion. We are maintaining very strong capital ratios while making these distributions. Moving to Slide 21. So this is a liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. We have $18 billion in excess cash and marketable securities, and the next 12 months of funding maturities is $16 billion. Moving to Slide 22. So this is our U.S. retail deposits by type. So we increased total deposits in the quarter by $1.2 billion up to $37 billion. Direct deposits increased by $1.3 billion, and third-party CDs decreased slightly. We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time. So with that, let me conclude with a few comments. Given the uncertain environment, we feel positive about our financial performance, including our ability to continue to grow EPS in the third quarter in the absence of settlement payments and with significantly lower reserve releases. Spending growth continues to be healthy despite the uneven economy. Third quarter billings growth rate was slightly below the prior quarters, which seemed consistent with the broader pattern of decline seen recently by others in the industry. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, leading to 6% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year. Revenue growth of 4% or 5% on an FX-adjusted basis slowed somewhat versus prior quarters and reflects the impact of a weaker economic environment. This stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year declines. In the quarter, we demonstrated notable expense discipline with operating expense declining 2% versus the prior year. This is consistent with our plan of growing operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future. This was evidenced by marketing and promotion expense representing 9.7% of revenues this quarter, which is above our historic average of 9%. Our strong capital strength was also displayed this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 86% while maintaining very strong capital ratios. Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just in terms of billed business, can you give us a sense of how it progressed throughout the quarter? I know that it was 7% at the Analyst Day on a days-adjusted basis, and it obviously came in a little bit stronger than that. And then second, just in terms of the European franchise, it was up 3%. In the quarter, can you give us a sense of how that looked by country? Did you see any weakness beyond Spain and Italy?\nDaniel T. Henry: So as you said, we disclosed that on an FX and days mix adjusted. It was 7% in July. So we're up slightly from there. So obviously, the last 2 months were a little stronger than July. But I would say it was pretty even over those 2 remaining months. So there's not a trend going in either direction. In terms of Europe -- sorry, we had some background noise there. In terms of Europe, I think it's slightly slower growth than we saw last quarter. Notwithstanding that, it is down slightly but still at 3%. So again, we're seeing some slowdown, really, across Europe, so no major change in terms of how the various countries are performing on a relative basis to each other.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just in terms of -- can you just give us a little bit more color on the review of the IRR [ph], what drove it? What are the some of the key changes in your estimates that lead you to believe that there could be a charge taken?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. The -- I think in the normal course, we periodically think it's appropriate to review the estimation process. It's generally driven by behavior changes by customers or as we collect more information. So in the first quarter of 2011, we made a change in the estimation process. Previous to that, we had only used attriter information, people who had left the program, to estimate the ultimate redemption rate for the active participants. At that juncture, we started to incorporate information from active participants. And so after that, we thought we would monitor it, and we thought it was appropriate at this juncture to do an evaluation of the estimation process.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And if I could just sneak one last question in, in terms of the add-on products, can you give us any sense of what percentage of revenue this is? And have you made any changes to the products that you're offering? Have you shut down any of the selling of any of these products?\nDaniel T. Henry: So like everybody else in the industry, we know that regulators had a concern about them. So we stopped marketing earlier in the year, and we'll no longer offer Account Protector or ID Protect products as of December 31 of this year. And I'd point out that these products are not a significant source of revenue to us.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Back on that URR question, I was just wondering, have you guys considered possibly making changes to your programs, such that to influence the URR lower? I mean, or is it -- is there something that precludes you from doing that, like competition and market share loss? And then, secondarily, I was just wondering on the Walmart partnership and others. I was just wondering what the P&L implications are, just so -- I assume that there's some kind of revenue share agreement. I mean, do those get accounted for in the marketing line? And -- or are they contra-revenue items?\nDaniel T. Henry: So Membership Rewards, we view as being a competitive advantage to us. As I said, they are an important part of driving billings. It also is a way for us to have a very close relationship to our customers. So it's a key element. It's not the only element. Certainly, cardmember benefits and superior servicing are all part of our value proposition, but Membership Rewards is a program that we think is the best in the industry. We actually think, to the extent we enhance the program and we have higher redemptions, that, that will have a very positive impact on the long-term health of our business. So at this juncture, we're not thinking of any initiatives -- wholesale initiatives to change the value proposition and drive the ultimate redemption rate down. If it continues to increase and drive billings in the future, then we would view that as a positive. In terms of Walmart -- so Walmart, we will, from that product, earn certain discount rate at the prepaid discount rate. We also will earn some float on the balances. There are no rewards costs related to this. There may be some minimal credit-type losses. There are actually no credit losses, but there could be some fraud losses. And really, what we need to do is grow this so that we can scale this and take advantage of what is a relatively low, fixed-base cost related to this product. So that's what I would say in terms of what you should expect in the future in terms of what lines it will hit.\nOperator: We will go next to Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Dan, as we get closer to the next CCAR process after a year in which you didn't really deploy any significant capital on acquisitions, is there anything you can share with us about what type of payout ratio might be a reasonable request in light of your strong capital position?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think last year, when we made our request, we wanted to remain [ph] flexibility so that if we were to do acquisitions, that we had built that into the submission that we had made, and also have the ability to distribute a significant portion of earnings if we didn't do acquisitions. And I would think we would structure our submission in a similar manner this year to give us flexibility in terms of what we do into 2013. And I think the fact that we have a strong capital base and the fact that we fared very well in the severe scenario that the Fed selected and had our capital drop to a much lower degree than most others, I think, are all contributing factors that put us in a position to actually make that type of submission.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, got it. And another question. Your loan growth has really been consistently better than the rest of the industry over last year. To what do you kind of attribute that outsized growth relative to peers? And also, kind of what do you think the implications are for credit going forward?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think we saw in -- throughout 2009 -- the flutter [ph] of 2009, '10 and '11 that we improved sooner on the credit side than most of the industry. And I think loan growth, as we were in 2011, was probably being impacted by the fact that people were deleveraging and we were seeing paydown rates increase over that period. But over the last 4 quarters or so, we've seen our paydown rates stabilize more. And as you know, our paydown rates are significantly higher than the competition. But the fact that those paydown rates are not going up, I think, is a contributing factor to the growth rate in loans gradually increasing over time. And as you know, we are very focused on Charge Card but also premium lending, and so I think all of those things are contributing factors to the growth we see in loans.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And any implications in there?\nDaniel T. Henry: In credit? As you know, our credit metrics are at historical lows. As we think about where we go from here, we want to be thoughtful in terms of growing the business -- growing the premium business. Obviously, as you bring on new accounts, they have a somewhat higher risk profile just because they're at an earlier tenure in their life. And quite frankly, I've said this before, if you were to give me a choice of bringing in a group of customers that were going to have a 3% write-off rate, but had better economics compared to a group of customers that had a 2% write-off rate and lower economics, I would pick the group with the 3% write-off rate. Because again, we're not endeavoring just to have a low write-off rate, but good economic decisions when we do our investments.\nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I had a couple of questions. So first, back to the URR and just trying to continue to understand the trajectory here versus -- what are you finding when you look at -- you said you started looking at people that are staying in the program versus people that are leaving. How much higher is the redemption rate of those staying in the program versus those you found who have left? And secondly, if I could follow up on Loyalty Partner, we spent a lot of time discussing that when I visited you guys recently, and I know the growth in Germany and India is outstanding and you're coming to Mexico. But when you put that in a broader context of the additional $3 billion in fee income over 5 years that you had suggested, I think it was 3 Financial Community Meetings ago, where are we in that progress?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So in talking about the ultimate redemption rate, in the first quarter of 2011, we moved from using strictly data from people who had attrited to estimate the ultimate redemption rate to using that data plus information related to current participants, and we thought that would give us a better estimate. So that was kind of the change that we made at that juncture. The work we're doing now in terms of reviewing the estimation process is we're looking at whether we can enhance the segmentation of the information so that we can have a refined estimate that's enhanced. So that's the reason that we are looking at that. I fully recognize that saying that we're going to have a charge isn't particularly helpful to you in terms of understanding the amount. But at this juncture, we haven't evolved the models to a sufficient degree to have a reliable estimate. But I guess, in terms of trying to frame it for yourself, 2 things that you may think about is, first, as we disclosed in the annual report, if there was a 100-basis-point increase in the URR -- this is not a forecast. I'm simply quoting from the annual report. If there was a 100-basis-point increase, then, too, we would have a $330-million increase in the liability and there would be a charge to P&L in that period. I guess the other data point that I would give you, that we haven't disclosed before, is that if we had a 100-basis-point increase in the URR, that would have an impact of increasing annual expense by approximately $40 million. So that's in terms of just dimensionalizing it. Hopefully, it's helpful. Now in terms of your second question related to fee-based revenue progress, so we continue to expand the services we offer to cardmembers, merchants and other customers. There has been no change to the target that we put out there. We're about halfway through our time frame and still think our target is appropriate, although $3 billion is an ambitious target in an economy that remains so uneven. There's still a great deal of work to do, but we are moving forward on a number of fronts. Our emphasis will be on organic growth, but targeted acquisitions, such as Loyalty Partner and Accertify, may also play a role if we see the right opportunities. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Then we'll go next to James Freeman (sic) [James Friedman] with Susquehanna.\nJames E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Could you share some observations or comments with regard to the fee-based revenue, if you might have an update in that regard?\nDaniel T. Henry: So fee-based revenues is -- basically, the update is what I just said a moment ago. We continue to expand our services. We're about halfway through the time frame that we laid out to hit the $3-billion target. We recognize that it's a very ambitious target, given the economy. And we have great deal of work to do, but we're moving forward. I think we'll primarily get it through organic initiatives, but we may do targeted acquisitions as well.\nJames E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So in that regard, Dan, are you still comfortable with the targets that Ken had set forward a year or so ago?\nDaniel T. Henry: We think that target, which is to be at a $3-billion run rate as we exit 2014, continues to be an appropriate target.\nJames E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, one last one if I could sneak it in. So could you share some observations about APAC? I know it's not huge, but it was a little clunky. Were there any specific observations in markets like Australia?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So Asia Pacific, yes, so I think we -- so Australia is a big market for us within the Asian market and we have seen a decline in business there, particularly in the T&E segment. And we think that's probably a reflection of the fact that China is slowing down and Australia's economy has some pretty close linkages to China. So that's the biggest impact that we're seeing that is influencing the slowdown in the growth rate in billings in that region.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Dan, given the trajectory of loan growth and spending growth that you're seeing, can you just give some commentary around whether you expect spending growth and loan growth to cross, as you look ahead, such that basically loan growth overtakes spending growth? And then secondly, when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to reserve building?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I would not -- I don't want to forecast here, but I think loan growth is driven by 2 things: one, it's the growth rate in spending on lending products; and then the second aspect is customer behavior and whether they are still in a mode that they want to kind of de-lever, in which case, we're going to see higher paydown rates. Or at some juncture, should they move to a space where they're more comfortable and aren't focused on that, in which case, we could move to a spot where the growth in loans is very similar to the growth in spending on lending products. But there's lots of factors that play into that. Certainly, we have never ever had a target for loan growth. So loan growth is simply an outcome of the products we put out there that allow customers to revolve if they choose to and then how that customer utilizes the balance. But it emphasized that we are very focused on premium lending. We are not engaging in balance transfer, and we are looking to acquire customers that are higher spenders. We also have a focus on the fact that there are customers out there who are very good customers for us, are high spenders and carry balances at other institutions. And I think we'd be very interested in acquiring those balances. So certainly, just like Charge Card, premium lending has very good economics, and it will continue to be one of our focuses going forward.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And when does the loan growth that you're seeing lead to some reserve building that -- we've been seeing kind of releases overwhelm everything else, but is that something -- can you give us some color on when you expect that to change?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think, as we grow the business, we have always maintained the same types of credit requirements. Although certainly, as we look to get deeper penetration into premium lending, you bring on new customers. And any time you bring in a cohort of new customers, at least in the first 2 years of their life, they tend to have higher credit losses. So that could be one element of it. And again, we -- as I said before, we don't target loan write-off rates. We target good economics. Obviously, the percentage of people who are in that lower-tenured group could be a factor, then obviously the economy. If the economy continues to be strong as we grow our business, you'll probably see less of a movement. If we see some deterioration in the economy, that'll obviously influence it as we go forward.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And finally, if I can just do one last one, and going back to the fee-based questions, can you just clarify for us whether you consider bluebird, Serve and just prepaid in general to be part of your fee-based initiatives? And are revenues from prepaid, I guess, included in that fee-based revenue target that you put out there?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think certain elements would be. So to the extent we get discount revenue on bluebird, you could look at that as it's a fee, because it is a fee. And certainly, other fee elements related to Serve would fit there. To the extent we have interest income on float, I wouldn't consider that to be a fee. So it may -- certain elements in the product will be fees and others will not. But certainly, they would be part of what we're looking to in terms of achieving our target over time.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, and I'm sorry, but just to be clear on that, so the volume that you're going to get on Serve and bluebird, that's going to get thrown into discount revenues and that will drive fees, but the fees on that will count as part of the $3-billion fee-based revenue target.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, it is. And I think it's logical because there's really no credit risk associated with those fees. So I kind of view it a little different than we might discount revenue related to either charge or lending products.\nOperator: And we now have a question from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Could you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing in the decline in T&E spending? Is it fewer transactions? Is it lower prices on hotels or airline tickets? I noticed there was an increase in airline spending, about 2%, I think, FX adjusted. But I'm wondering if there's economic slowdown occurring in more than just Australia.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I would say that we are seeing lower T&E spending compared to other categories pretty broadly. It was a contributor to Australia. It also was a contributing factor to the slowdown in growth rate for Global Corporate Services. And I think we see large corporations, in particular, being a little bit conservative here and seeing a drop in spending among some of our larger corporate clients. So it's pretty -- I think it's pretty broad-based.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And spread geographically as well.\nDaniel T. Henry: Spread geographically as well, yes, and in some lower levels of transactions. But notwithstanding that, when you consider all those negatives I just said in that sentence, we still are managing to have good business growth on an FX-adjusted basis of 8%.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Right, okay. And then I think you referenced higher cash rebates. Can you just give us an idea of how much those are as an offset to discount revenue line?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, it's not an item that we separately disclose. It is one of the items that represents the difference between the growth in billed business and the growth in discount revenues. And I guess it's a reflection of the fact that our cash-back products are being successful in the marketplace, so that pleases us in terms of that product category.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And then finally, could you just clarify what you were saying about the regulatory and litigation reserves? It sounds like you didn't take anything additional in third quarter. Is that to say that you don't -- and I guess, you don't anticipate, or it's not a problem, not estimable [ph], what's related to the protection...\nDaniel T. Henry: So the majority of the payout we had under the regulatory order had been previously accrued. However, in this quarter, as we continued to do our own ongoing reviews, we did accrue amounts related to those reviews. So they were variable enough to mention but not so large that we would provide the dollar amount.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And I guess, could you give us a sense if they were more or less than a year ago in the third quarter? So was that...\nDaniel T. Henry: So in the third quarter of last year -- I think in each of the quarters that we've had, I think they've been manageable numbers.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: You have a big P&L, but just for the sake of...\nDaniel T. Henry: That's a good thing.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes. But for the sake of kind of making sense of this quarter's expenses versus last quarter, can you just, since you don't want to tell us the amount, give us a sense of the size?\nDaniel T. Henry: As I said, I think if you went back to the fourth quarter through now, there has been some amount in each quarter but none in any quarter that kind of crosses our threshold for disclosing the amount.\nOperator: Your next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: It's been pretty quiet on the DOJ case in 2012. I was just curious, as you look out to '13, do you expect to see any procedural-type moves? Or would you expect it to be quiet again in '13?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think what we're expecting is for discovery to be completed sometime early in 2013. And then after that, there'll be some time that elapses before we actually get to the next stage in the process.\nOperator: Then we'll go next to Chris Brendler with Stifel.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Could you just give us -- sort of turning back to one of the earlier questions on the $3-billion target for fee-based revenues, I guess I'm not sure. At this point, it's been at least 1 year, almost 2, since you laid out those goals. I'm just wondering, what's going well? What's not? It seems like -- I would have thought we'd get a little more detail on Serve and how that's progressing. The bluebird product seems like a very compelling offer. It could be a big part of that pie should -- as you seek to achieve that $3-billion goal. Can you give us any detail on what the major components of that revenue target were and where you stand today in any way, shape or form?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I -- there's certainly a broad set of initiatives. Certainly, Serve and prepaid reloadables would be elements where we would expect to contribute to our target. Loyalty Partner is an acquisition that we've discussed with you. We would think that's another notable piece of the pie. I would say, though, that if we were to sit here 3 years ago and think about the progress that would've been made in alternative payments and wallets and the like, you probably would've thought we were further along than we are today. So that's not a comment about American Express, specifically, but really about the industry. We continue to see a fair amount of press releases but not necessarily a fair amount of product that's in the marketplace. And the other thing, as I mentioned, is this is a pretty uneven economy. So it makes the achieving that target all the more challenging, but we do have a number of projects that are under way. And we continue to look at other initiatives as we go forward over the next 2 years, as we head towards the latter part of 2014.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, a follow-up question on the credit card business. The lending margin was up this quarter. I didn't exactly -- understand exactly what was driving that. It wasn't like a huge increase but it looked, by my calculations, to be mostly on the top line yields, a nice little bump in the interest charges you're getting on your lending accounts. Anything driving that? I mean, your lending growth has been relatively impressive. I know it's a byproduct of your spending strategy. Just trying to think about what's causing the yield to go up at the same time the loan growth is picking up.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, it's -- so as you say, it's only up slightly. It could be a little bit related to revolve rates but not a huge move in revolve rates. So we continue to watch it and make sure that the mix we have is right. Certainly, just a change in mix among products can also have a slight increase in terms of -- increase or decrease, depending on which way it moves. So we watch it closely. We've said that we want that number to be around 9% and that's what it's been largely over the last several quarters, slightly higher this quarter but not by a huge amount.\nOperator: Then we'll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe we could get you to dimensionalize some of the asset growth, the lending products growth. You kind of pointed out that spending growth is better than the lending growth and that there's a number of factors that are driving that. But could you, in any way, provide us with some sense as to whether this is an increase in traction for the premium lending strategy or if this is just the willingness of existing card members to increase their borrowing?\nDaniel T. Henry: So it's hard to tease that out, to be quite frank. We are focused on premium lending. We have developed products to drive in that direction. As I said before, we recognize that there are some of our cardmembers who we know very well and we think have good credit who have balances elsewhere. That's certainly one of the things that we are thinking about. We're staying away from balance transfers and those kinds of initiatives, so we're not going there. And as I said before, we have never had a target for loan growth. It's an outcome of putting products in the marketplace as a design to drive spend and then the consumer deciding to utilize that. And how much they want to utilize that in part will be impacted by lots of things, including how they feel in terms of their confidence and where the economy is going. So there's lots of small moving parts within there. But there's not one overarching driving force that is impacting loan growth. And you could see that it's been a very gradual increase over time. And the fact that is the biggest is that 1 year ago or more, we were really seeing an increase in the paydown rate. And that was holding down loan growth effectively, and that has really -- it's increasing a little bit, but it's really stabilized over the last several quarters. So in terms of a change, I would say that's probably the largest contributing factor.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe if you could discuss in any way the decision to essentially rebrand Serve with a much bigger American Express prominence. I've found that to be quite interesting. I don't know if there's a thought that it just wasn't getting enough traction as an independent brand, and it just needs to effectively ride on the coattails of American Express. But if you could provide some sense as to what drove that decision.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think all new products evolve over time. And I think as a company, we came to the realization that our brand has a lot of attributes which are important to people who would use the Serve product or a reloadable prepaid. We do stand for trust, security and servicing. All those things are important when you think about a product like those. And so the decision was made to make it more prominent, so people who are purchasing those products recognize the linkage of Serve to the American Express family.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And is there any -- I mean, is it essentially targeting, from an aspirational brand perspective, a different demographic now? Or is it still the same and it's just a function of gaining more traction?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think -- obviously, people who are utilizing the reloadable prepaid, in particular, are a different group of customers than some of our premium products. But I think many of the attributes of our company and our brand are important to that customer group as well. And we think we have a platform in Serve, which is what reloadable prepaid is running on, and so we want to leverage that. And we think we can put products out there that can be very competitive in the marketplace.\nOperator: That will come from Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.\nMichael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: So just wanted to follow up on the bluebird question. So it seems like the obvious rationale here is to push more volume onto Amex's network. But I guess, are there some secondary benefits as well? So in other words, from a data standpoint, do you benefit from getting access to a different demographic? And does that help you with some of your other businesses? And would it also potentially help you on the acceptance front as well?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I'd say yes to all of those things, right? So I think it does push more volume onto our network. We think that is a very good thing. We think we can achieve good economics. We also see it as a large market today, I think over $300 billion. And it's forecasted to grow at, I think, 12% to 13% going forward. So it's a growing market. We have the capabilities and skills to be successful here. And so we viewed it as a good opportunity and also helping to grow to -- contribute to our growth in fee businesses.\nMichael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on -- a lot of talk about the fiscal cliff here coming up and just wondering, does that affect your guys -- your planning at American Express in terms of the timing of marketing and your ability to maybe -- if there is a larger impact than expected, to ratchet back on maybe some of your marketing spend early next year?\nDaniel T. Henry: So in our planning, we always have a base-case plan, and we have been scenarios. If things were to be better, we know exactly what we'd do. And if things were to be worse, we know exactly what we're going to do. So we will monitor this closely. But at the moment, we're focused on our base plan but do have these other scenarios in case we need to react quickly. Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.\nRichard Petrino: Thank you. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2011 10-K and Q1 2012 10-Q report, already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the second quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com, we have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I'll start on Slide 2. Total revenues net of interest expense came in at $7,965,000,000. That's an increase of 5% compared to last year. On an FX-adjusted basis, it's an increase of 7%. Income from continuing operations was $1,339,000,000. That's an increase of 3%. EPS from continuing operations came in at $1.15. That's 7% increase compared to last year. The difference in growth rate between EPS and income from continuing operations are the share buybacks that we've been doing. If you go 2 lines down, you can see that the diluted shares outstanding are down 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And return on equity came in at 27%. So moving to Slide 3, these are our second quarter 2012 metrics. Billed business comes in at $221.6 billion. That's 7% higher on a reported basis and 9% higher on an FX-adjusted basis. And throughout, you'll see that FX is having a larger impact on reported results than normal because of the strength of the U.S. dollar. If we were to look back at billed business growth, just to see a trend, if you went back to the second quarter of 2011, on an FX-adjusted basis, we had growth of 15% in billed business. That moved to 13% in the third quarter of last year, 11% in the fourth quarter. It ticked up to 13% in the first quarter of this year. However, it had the benefit of leap year and came in at 12.6%, so round that up. So I view that more similar to the fourth quarter at 11%. But in this quarter, we're 9%. So we are seeing a slowing in the growth rates over, really, the last 4 quarters. So cards-in-force are up to $100 million, up 6% from last year. GNS cards are growing at 15%, and proprietary cards are growing at 2%. We again see good growth in basic cardmember spending, which illustrates the high level of customer engagement that we have. Cardmember loans are $61 billion, that compares with $60.1 billion in the first quarter of this year and 4% growth compared to the second quarter of 2011. Worldwide travel sales increased 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. So moving to Slide 4, this is billed business growth by segment, FX-adjusted. So each business really had a similar slowing in billed business growth for the quarter. Each decreased about 3% or 4%, so really broad-based slowing in the growth rate. GNS continues to be the highest growth rate at 13%. If we move to Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region, again, FX-adjusted. And here again, you can see that each region has a similar slowing in the billed business growth rate, that ranges from a decline of 2% to 4% and, again, is broad-based. And as you'd expect, EMEA has the lowest growth rate but still had positive growth at 4%. Just a little information for countries within EMEA, Germany had a growth of 5%, U.K. grew at 4%, Italy was flat with last year, and Spain decreased 5%. JAPA continues to be the highest-growth region. So moving to Slide 6. So this is providing some information on billed business in international currencies. So we're providing this because of the impact that foreign exchange was having on the reported numbers. So just to take you through the slide, obviously, these are several of our major countries that we operate in. The first information there, so looking at the euro, for instance, the 5% to 7% is the approximate range of billed business in the euro compared to total billed business. For Australia, it's 5% to 6%. If you go down to the next line, this is really the year-over-year change in the foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar. So in the second quarter of 2012, the strength of the U.S. dollar drove a 2% reduction in our billed business growth rate. So as you know, in periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, volume metrics and revenue growth rates are negatively impacted when translated back into U.S. dollars, while inversely, expense [ph] growth rates benefit from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As we have estimated in our 2011 annual report, the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar related to overseas operations for 12 months would be about $175 million. So that's an annual amount if there was a 10% impact. And as you can see for the numbers on this slide that impact is in aggregate less than 10%. So in general, it's our policy to hedge the P&L one quarter out. Slide 7. So this is lending billed business, which is the solid line, the growth rate in lending billed business. And the dotted line is the growth rate in managed loans. So we still have a gap. We have a growth rate of lending billed business being higher at 9% compared to managed loans, which is growing at 4%. But the gap continues to narrow. Now paydown increased quite a bit in 2009 and 2010 but has stabilized in recent quarters. In the second quarter, the trust paydown rate was 31.5%, and that's well above industry average. And as I'll speak to in a few minutes, our credit is behaving very well on loans. So moving to Slide 8, so this is revenue performance. So total revenues grew at 5%. It's not on this slide, but on FX-adjusted basis, it grew at 7%. So starting with discount revenue, it grew at 5%, and this reflects 7% billed business growth, offset by higher contra-revenues including corporate incentive payments and higher cash rebates. Average discount rate on the second quarter of this year was 2.54%, which is flat with the second quarter of 2011, although over time, we still expect the average discount rate to decrease slightly due to pricing incentives and mix change. If we look at the next 3 revenue lines: net card fees, travel commissions and fees and other commissions and fees, on a reported basis, they're basically flat, but on an FX-adjusted basis, they are growing at between 3% and 4%. So if we look at other revenues, that increased 21%, and that includes a $30 million gain on the sale of a portion of our ICBC investment, a favorable revision in the estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques in international markets, and higher royalty payments from our GNS partners. Looking at net interest income, it increased 4%, and that's driven by 4% growth in loans. And our net yield is the same this year as it was in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in 4% net interest income growth. So moving to Slide 9, so this is provision for losses. Credit continues to perform very well. However, provision increased 29% as lending reserve releases are well below what we saw in the second quarter of 2011. In charge card, we had higher write-off dollars in the second quarter of this year compared to last year, and that was offset by higher reserve releases in the second quarter of this year than last year, all these -- although these are much smaller amounts than what we see in lending. But the net of that is that the charge card provision is flat, as you can see on this chart. Now in lending, we had lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year. The write-offs this year were $370 million compared to $511 million last year, so write-offs are $140 million lower in this period, so that would drive provision down. However, we had lower reserve releases, as you can see on the chart, and therefore, the benefit of reserve releases were about $230 million less than last year. And as a result, the lending provision is $100 million higher than we had in the second quarter of 2011. So moving to Slide 10, so these are charge card credit metrics. And as you can see on the left, the U.S. consumer and small business group had higher write-off rates in the second quarter of 2011 at 2% compared to 1.5% in the second quarter of last year. And that's why on the prior chart, we had higher write-off dollars in charge card. But I will note that the 2% is lower than the 2.3% in write-offs that we saw in the first quarter this year. International Consumer and Global Corporate products, for the right chart, you can see that credit continues to perform very well, and these are -- all of these metrics are at historically low levels. Next, I'll take you to Slide 11. So these are lending credit metrics. And on the left, you can see that the write-off rate decreased from 3.1% in the second quarter of 2011 to 2.2% in the second quarter of this year, and it's also down 10 basis points from 2.3% in the first quarter. So in the second quarter of this year, if you look at it by month, in April, the write-off rate was 2.4%. In May, it was 2.2%, and in June, it was 2.0%. So we have an improving trend in the quarter. If you look at the right side, this is 30 days past due, and this is also improving. So it improved from 1.6% in the second quarter of last year to 1.4% in the first quarter of this year, and 1.3% this quarter. So I'll just remind you that our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate but achieve the best economic gain when we make investments. But these metrics are at historic low levels and represent best-in-class credit metrics in the industry. Slide 12. So this is lending reserve coverage. You can see that both the U.S. card and worldwide reserves as a percentage of loans continue to come down as the write-off rates and the \"30 day past due\" rates improve. So the percentage now for the U.S. card is 2.6%, and worldwide is 2.5%. Reserves as a percentage of past due are similar this quarter to the percentages that we had in the first quarter of this year, and that's true for the principal months coverage as well. So for those people who can hear the thunder in the background, if you're not in New York, it's a big lightning and thunder storm here. So the reserves, we think, are appropriate based on the credit models that we use to set reserves. Moving to Slide 13, so this is expense performance. So here you can see that total expenses increased 4 -- 2% and on an FX-adjusted basis, which is not on the slide, would have increased 4%. If you exclude the Visa/MasterCard settlement payments of $220 million that we received in the second quarter of 2011 and which were 0 this quarter, total expenses would have decreased by 2%. So I'll cover each of the individual line items on this slide and subsequent slides, but I would point out that the effective tax rate this quarter of 29% reflects the realization of certain foreign tax credits this year. And the 27% in the second quarter of '11 reflects the impact of favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax items. A normal tax rate for us would be in the low 30s. Looking at Slide 14, so this is marketing and promotion. So on the prior slide, we saw that in the second quarter of this year, marketing and promotion was $773 million. And that's down from 3%, from $795 million in the second quarter of 2011, but it is up from $631 million in the first quarter of this year. So we have said that our target for marketing promotion generally is to be around 9% of revenues so that we can drive growth. In the first quarter, when marketing and promotion was only 8.3% of revenues, we said we had a plan for full year marketing promotion to be approximately 9%. In this quarter, we increased marketing promotion to 9.7% of revenues, and we are continuing to invest in the business at healthy levels to drive growth, and this puts us on track to achieve our plan of approximately 9% -- for marketing to be 9% for the full year of revenues. If we move to Slide 15, so now we're now covering cardmember rewards expense. So cardmember rewards expense for this quarter was $1,463,000,000, and that's down 9% from $1,613,000,000 in the second quarter of 2011. Now the blue section of this bar represents MR points earned in the current period and co-brand expense. I remind you that for co-brand products, the co-brand partner has the obligation to deliver the reward. We pay the co-brand partner each month for the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability. On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and had a balance sheet reserve of approximately $5 billion at the end of 2011. The green section of the bar represents Membership Rewards expense related to points earned in previous periods due to an increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate or a change in the estimate of the weighted average cost per point. The green section in 2002 -- the green section in the second quarter of 2011 represents an increase in the ultimate redemption rate based on customer behavior and an increase in the weighted average cost per point in the second quarter of 2011. Now you can see that there is no green section in the second quarter of 2012 as we had a modest increase in the ultimate redemption rate, much low -- in the second quarter of this year, much lower than the increase in the second quarter of 2011. This quarter is much closer to historical levels of an increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the quarter. But we did have an increase in that we created an expense in the quarter, but it was offset by a reduction in the weighted average cost per point in this quarter, which reduces expense in the quarter, and the 2 items net to approximately 0. Slide 16, operating expense performance, and we have been very focused on this area. On a reported basis, total operating expense increased 10% in the quarter. But if you exclude the Visa/MasterCard litigation settlement proceeds that are included in the second quarter of last year but are 0 this year, it would have been a growth of 2%. Now salaries and benefits decreased 4% compared to last year. And that reflects the fact that in the second quarter of '11, we had a $48 million reengineering charge, and in this quarter of 2012, we had the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Our total employee count was approximately 64,000 and is relatively consistent with the prior year and last quarter. If we look at professional services, it's lower by 5% as last year had higher levels of technology costs. If we look at occupancy and equipment, it's up 14%, and this reflects higher data processing costs related to software licenses and some higher rent. If we look at adjusted other net of $422 million in the second quarter of '12, it increased significantly from $92 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily reflecting the Visa/MasterCard settlement payment received in 2011. In addition, the increase includes accruals for refunds to customers as well as investment impairments. As to the customer refunds, we are discussing matters with our U.S. banking regulators, including those mentioned in the 10-K. Based on those conversations and our own ongoing internal reviews, we have made some changes to our CARD practices at our 2 banking subsidiaries: Centurion Bank and FSB. The expense for these items is largely reflected in adjusted net other in this quarter. Moving to Slide 17. So this is 8 quarters of information on operating expense levels. And we are at operating expense levels that we believe will enable us to drive business growth. Going forward, we will continue to implement our plans to contain operating expenditures. As you can see, operating expense was similar in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter. Now I'm not making a forecast here, but if operating expense stays at the current level, the growth rate for the full year adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds would be in the low single-digits, and there's no change to our objective of growing operating expense more slowly than revenue growth over the next 2 to 3 years. Slide 18. So this is expense flexibility over time, and this slide shows adjusted expenses as a percentage of revenues, and adjusted expenses excludes credit provision. So on the left side, you can see 5 years of history and on the right side, the past 5 quarters. So both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2011 show improvement compared to the quarters in 2011. And while the second quarter rounds to 71%, it is slightly lower than in the first quarter. Over time, we expect this rate to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top-line revenue growth and, second, through expense flexibility, which includes our plans to contain operating expense growth. Moving to Slide 19, so these are our capital ratios. Our Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of 2011, that's not on the slide, was 12.3%. It increased to 13.4% in the first quarter of this year as share repurchases did not start until mid-March, after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan. In the second quarter, we built capital with $1.3 billion of net income and $200 million related to employee plans. And as planned, we made capital distributions of $2 billion, $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $200 million in dividends, resulting in Tier 1 common moving to 2.8%. The Tier 1 common ratio of 2.8% puts us in a strong capital position and well above required benchmarks. Moving to Slide 20, so this is total payout ratios. The left side, you can see the ratios for the last 5 years, and on the right, for the past 4 quarters. In the first quarter of 2012, as I just mentioned, we didn't start share repurchases until mid-March. So we only repurchased $200 million in the first quarter of this year. The capital distribution plan allows for $4 billion in share repurchases in 2012, and we repurchased $1.8 billion in the second quarter to bring our year-to-date repurchases to $2 billion, so half of the allowed repurchases at the midpoint of the year. Slide 21 is our liquidity snapshot. We continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet the next 12 months of funding maturities. So we have $16 billion in excess cash and marketable securities, and the next 12 months of maturities is $15 billion. So moving to Slide 22, so this is U.S. retail deposits. As we had limited cash needs in the second quarter and we issued $2.5 billion in unsecured debt and asset-backed securitizations, we allowed deposits to decrease in the quarter by $1.7 billion, but we remain committed to increase direct deposits over time. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Given the uncertain environment, we feel positive about our financial performance in the second quarter, including our ability to continue to grow earnings in the absence of settlement proceeds and with lower reserve releases. Spending growth remained relatively strong, albeit at a slower pace than recent quarters, and we continue to grow faster than most of our large issuing competitors despite a more difficult prior-year comparison. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, with net yields comparable to the prior year, leading to 4% growth in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates improved to new all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense increased as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year than last year. Our revenue growth of 5% or 7% on FX-adjusted basis reflects the benefits of our spend-centric mode and stands in contrast to many other issuers who still face year-over-year revenue declines. In the quarter, total expenses were well controlled at only 2% growth or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in the card base while continuing to build capabilities for the future. Marketing and promotion, though down slightly year-over-year, represent 9.7% of revenues, up from 8.3% last quarter. In addition, we are continuing to move forward with our plans to grow operating expenses more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years. We also wanted to remind you that starting in the third quarter, the impact on operating expense growth rates of losing the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds will decline significantly. Our capital strength was also on display this quarter as we were able to elevate our year-to-date payout ratio to 83% while maintaining very strong capital ratios. Looking ahead, we recognize that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. So thanks for listening, and we are now going to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: I wanted to inquire about performance on billed business so far in July. And also, if you could comment on -- just looking at domestic billed business, seasonality would dictate growth, link quarter around the 10% range, we're a little off from that this quarter. I was wondering if you could discuss any possible specific places where it might have weakened or if it was just general?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think we're not going to comment on July to-date numbers. I would say, though, that in the second quarter, the growth rate that we saw in June was very comparable to the growth rate that we saw in May. In terms of categories, I would say that we probably saw slower growth in T&E categories than we saw in other categories. But really, the changing growth rates that we saw, as I illustrated on the slides, was really across all of our business lines and really across all geographies. So yes, I would say it was pretty broad-based.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: And if I can ask one follow-up. Regarding the top line, you had mentioned incentive payments as an offset in discount revenue. We've heard that from you guys a couple of times now. Is there any way that we could think about modeling that? And is it worth our time to figure out how to model that as an offset to pure discount revenue?\nDaniel T. Henry: So modeling always assumes that the future will be the same as the past, if you use historical information. We have had, over the last several quarters, higher levels of incentive payments. Those are based on new agreements with many of our large corporate clients. That is a business that has very high levels of profitability for us. So despite the higher level of incentive payments, sometimes which are triggered by new agreements, sometimes triggered by corporate customers just spending at higher level. And again, we think they are effectively worthwhile investments because it is a business with very good profitability. But the levels that we have from period to period will kind of depend on the growth in their spending and when contracts are removed.\nOperator: And next we'll go to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Dan, just a follow-up on the prior question. Just in terms of the spend volumes, are you seeing any changes in terms of spending patterns, both here and internationally, whether it's moves from discretionary to nondiscretionary, were there any changes throughout the quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I don't know that there was big shift between discretionary and nondiscretionary. I guess I would just point out that last year in the second quarter, we grew 15%. I don't know that any of our competitors grew at that level. So to the extent you have that kind of growth, when you come to the next year, it's just a higher challenge in terms of growth rates. So given those higher comparables, I think our growth rates remain healthy and are reflective of the fact that the investments that we've made over the past couple of years continue to pay off.\nRyan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on the capital, so you've now repurchased $2 billion for the year, and I'm guessing some of this quarter was a catch-up from last quarter, but how do we think about for it over the next 3 quarters, given what your CCAR allotment is? And I know you've talked in the past about having some safer acquisitions, but it seems like we've been pretty quiet on that front. So I just want to think about how we should think about the path over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And second, now that we've gotten the NPR from the regulators, any sense of what the all-in Basel III capital level looks like?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So as you say, from the balance of the year, we have approvement based on our submission to buy back $2 billion more through the end of the year. We could afford to do modest levels of acquisitions and still buy back $2 billion more. If we had acquisitions at higher levels, then we would moderate the buybacks accordingly, which is, I think, very consistent with what we've said our plan would be as we to go through the course of this year. So no really -- no change there. In terms of new Basel information, what I remind you of is that we have our ratios calculated under Basel I, right? We are still in the process of developing what they would be under Basel II, so we don't have that information yet. But the impact in this quarter of going from Basel I to Basel III is approximately 30 basis points. It varies from quarter-to-quarter, but has generally been in the kind of 20- to 80-basis-points range, depending on quarter. This quarter it was about 30 basis points.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Dan, I hope you could talk a little bit about, post the MOU merchant settlement, if you can kind of remind us what you allow in terms of surcharging and what the potential impact might be going forward?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So I think, as most people know, we were not party to that litigation. That lawsuit was filed against Visa and MasterCard, and they control about 70% or 80% of the market. A fundamental legal difference is -- between us and Visa/MasterCard is that they have market power. The courts have recognized this and determined that they used that power improperly. American Express does not have market power. We continue to believe that there's no merit to the separate merchant cases that we are involved in, and we believe that we have strong legal defenses. Now as it relates to surcharging, surcharging is not consumer-friendly. The terms and conditions within the settlement agreement that deal with surcharging are very complicated. So given that complexity, we think it's too early to know what the impact of the rule changes might actually have in the marketplaces, but we obviously will monitor the situation and respond appropriately. Now we've seen different reactions in different international markets where surcharging is allowed by law. In Australia, some merchants have introduced surcharging. It was first allowed there back in 2003, and we've been able to respond effectively and continue to operate successfully. In contrast, in the U.K., we've seen very little evidence of merchants surcharging, and that was first allowed by the Thatcher government many, many years ago. The other thing I'd point out and you should keep in mind is that in the United States, there are 10 states that have laws that prohibit surcharging, and these states represent about 50% of our U.S. billings volume. So the Visa/MasterCard rule change doesn't change the terms of our contracts with merchants. We do not prevent merchants from surcharging, but we do continue to require parity treatment so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at point of sale. And by parity treatment, I mean that if a American Express cardmember is surcharged 100 basis points, any other credit card that is presented would be charged -- surcharged the same 100 basis points.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I was -- you pointed out in your earlier remarks that the total cards-in-force have been growing quite a bit more in the network partner area, I believe you stated 15% versus 2% proprietary. Can you dimensionalize maybe the differences in the customer base for network partner card versus the proprietary card? What you expect in terms of spend on a partner card versus a proprietary card, anything that we could -- let us maybe better forecast the overall growth on that line.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So GNS partners, when we speak to them, their products are targeted to their more affluent customers. That's really the design of the product. It's designed to encourage spending, so they are more affluent customers. Now I would say that the average spend within GNS partner customers is lower than the average spend in proprietary American Express cards. But we see the GNS business as a terrific business for us in that it brings more cardmembers into merchants, so it makes the American Express network more relevant in more markets. And often, these are customers that we would not be able to reach other than through the GNS partner relationships. Today, GNS has grown over the years to be a important contributor to income. Now while the dollar profit that we earn on each dollar of GNS-billed business is lower than what we earn on a dollar of proprietary billed business, it requires very little capital, and so the returns are good. The other thing I'd point out is that some of the -- that many of the GNS partnerships operate in both -- some markets are developed markets and some are developing markets, so you need to take that into consideration as well. But net-net, we think it is a good business overall in terms of the contribution and mix.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes. And so, just as a follow-up, I guess we just need to think about how that's going to impact the discount revenues versus overall spend. Also, I -- if I remember correctly, the network cards are mostly on a credit card platform versus a charge card platform. Is that correct?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I mean, so their products and our products run on our network, right? The cards that the GNS partners issue are often credit cards, so that's a difference. But they run on our -- they don't work -- run on a different network. It's the American Express network.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And maybe just if I could get one last one. On the refunds that your -- that you took the charge on for in the quarter, can you expand on that at all? We've seen some other peers that have taken similar charges, and I guess I'd just like to better understand what those refunds are.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So these are -- relate to certain changes that we've made in our CARD practices, and the changes generally relate to items around either pricing, exposure or collections. So that's a -- that gives you a little bit more flavor in terms of the changes we're making that led to the refunds that we're making to customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just as you pointed out, billed business during the quarter slowed across the board and across all platforms. So I'm just wondering, you also reiterated the desire to kind of continue to generate positive operating leverage. Just curious how much flexibility there is if we assume a further slowdown in billed business, given the global economic outlook, how much room there is to still continue to cut costs or accelerate the decline in costs?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think when we talk about our desire to contain operating expense, it's really a long-term view. So it's not just related to this quarter or next quarter or related to a potential slowdown. I think it's really a desire to create operating leverage so that expenses are growing at an appropriate level that enable us to have the investment dollars that we desire so that we can drive business over the long term and achieve our financial targets on an average and over time. So the whole notion of operating leverage is really designed as a long-term objective and not necessarily related to a short-term slowdown. We also could react if there was a severe short-term slowdown the way we have historically when there's been a recession. But I would think of those as really, really 2 different types of focuses on operating expense.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. So I mean, given -- assuming a modest slowdown in billed business growth, you'd still expect to generate operating leverage?\nDaniel T. Henry: It's our goal to continue to generate operating leverage from where we are today, yes.\nScott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, and you mentioned before M&A, if you do anything that's, I guess, not large, you still have limited buyback as well. Where are you seeing -- I mean, you haven't done anything recently, but where are you seeing the opportunities and where are you focused on M&A?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I think M&A, we would focus on what I'd describe as kind of bolt-on acquisitions, not very large acquisitions. They would be to enable us to achieve our strategic business objectives and/or be in something that's a very close adjacency. Loyalty partners is a good example of that, where they had a coalition loyalty platform in -- primarily in Germany, but in several other countries, we have a significant amount of loyalty experience and we have global reach, and we thought that was a very good combination. And we'd generally be in areas that would generate fee business going forward. So those would be the general parameters of what we're endeavoring to achieve.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just want to get a little more color, if you can, Dan, on the spending trends. I believe you said that June levels were similar to May levels, and it's a little early to get into July. But just looking at the June and May, I was under the impression that your last public update in June call, I think it was, guided to 9% to10% billed business growth through May. So I'm just trying to reconcile how it slowed all the way down to 7% with just the month of June if June was in line with May. Do I have those numbers right?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think you have the numbers right. But the 9% to 10% that we related to April and May were FX-adjusted.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. So right in line, then.\nDaniel T. Henry: The comparable number is 9% for the quarter.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Got it. Right in line, okay. And then the second question would be on the expense side, just getting a little more color on the HR costs, salaries and benefits line. The first time you've had a negative growth rate there since '09. I think you did call out the reengineering, but even if I adjust for reengineering, it's still down on a year-over-year basis versus up 7-plus percent in the first quarter. Anything else that helped cut costs this quarter on a personnel side? Is it lower bonus accruals that go along with this lower spending, or anything else that was one-time in nature that helped the OpEx growth slow so much on the PL -- personnel line?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think if you back out the reengineering, you kind of get close to flat. And then really we were helped, as all the expense lines were, by FX. So if you look at total -- I don't know if it's exactly in salaries and benefits, but on the total, it took the growth rate from total expense to the growth rate from 2% up to 4%. So if you had a similar relationship on salaries and benefits, it would be up about 2%, which is in the realm of what you would expect if you have a constant employee base. And what we had in this quarter was similar to what we had in the second quarter of last year in terms of total number of employees.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one final one on the spending side again. Some of those growth rates you gave us for some of the countries within the eurozone. Any color you can give us on how much those have changed and how much of a slowdown you're seeing in countries like Spain or Italy or Germany?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. I think we gave last quarter similar numbers, and I would venture to say that the countries in Southern Europe, if I remember correctly -- let's see, I actually have some data here, so let's see. So I would say each of the countries decreased by 2% or 3%, not much different than what we're seeing overall. Spain decreased a little bit more than that compared to last quarter. I think we said Spain was up 2% in the second -- first quarter this year. So not wide variation, other than Spain. Basically the same kind of trends that we're seeing across the world.\nOperator: And next we'll go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Dan, I believe you said that in the past that you think the 12% range is conservatively the Tier 1 common level that you see Amex operating at, given the uncertainties surrounding Basel II. 12% seems kind of high to me, but I wonder if you can just give us some updated thoughts there in terms of what the right Tier 1 common ratio is that we should be thinking about as your target level going forward.\nDaniel T. Henry: So initially, when we're coming out of the recession, we said we want to be at least 10% or 11%. I think over the course of the past couple of years, we've had good capital generation. And really, in 2011, we kind of increased from that 11% range up to the 12% range, because in our submission to the Fed in January of '11, we only asked for $2.3 billion of buybacks on the assumption that we were going to use half of the capital generated to do acquisitions, which would mean we'd do $2 billion in acquisitions. In fact, that year we only did $1 billion. So we effectively wound up as a result of that of retaining another $1 billion, and that took us from 11 up to 12%. I think we taken artificially high in the first quarter because we couldn't do share buybacks in the first quarter of '12 until our plan was approved. That was in the middle of March. So I'd expect to see us to trend back towards where we were at the beginning of this year, which was 12.3%. We think our submission was appropriate in terms of the levels of buybacks that we requested. And the fact that the Fed approved that level, I think, is a demonstration of our financial strength and flexibility. So this will evolve over time, and each year, we'll probably get better insight in terms of where we want to be. And as we move forward with the work that we're doing on Basel II, which we may not have better insights until we get to 2014, but when we get those better insights, we'll have a better sense of where we want just to settle in. Now the other thing, I think, that's important is not just a raw number that your Tier 1 common ratio is, but if you look at the stress test and see where your ratio is after that stress, may start to become even more important. And certainly, if you look at the data from this year, you can see that based on the stress test that the Fed decided the assumptions on, we had very limited drop in where the Tier 1 common was in that stress, which was different than many others. So I think people start to look at that. And that will be something we'll have to consider when we ultimately set where we decide to hold Tier 1 common ratio.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And as a follow-up, can you talk about what happened with the bluebird product at Walmart? If you just give a little bit more color there? And I believe you guys have talked about the -- converging all of your prepaid offerings under one platform. I believe that was the Serve platform. Can you update us on where we are on that and whether that's -- bluebird had anything to do with that convergence?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we do have a plan to move our reloadable prepaid product onto the Serve platform within the next couple of quarters. That doesn't have anything to do with bluebird, but it is a excellent use of the Serve platform for business that we think will be growing, and a business where we think we have a very good product in the marketplace compared to the competitions. So as it relates to bluebird, American Express and Walmart have a great partnership. Our work together on bluebird has moved to a new phase, and we continue to test different points of distribution and marketing messages while also collecting and analyzing feedback for customers who took part in our pilot. And at this time, it wouldn't make sense to speak about any future plans with bluebird, but we appreciate your interest around the bluebird project.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Have you got any specific plans to reduce the cost per point and how to think about that as we go forward?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think the cost per point is something that we're focused on just in terms of -- so the offerings that we put into the program are designed to create value for our customers. We have over 100 different options within the program that are part of what make it an excellent program. And certainly, as we think about adding customers and options, we do think about the overall costs to us. So it's a balance between value to our customers who participate in the Membership Rewards program and the cost of the program in terms of the overall economics of the products that we offer. So for years, we've been focused on the cost per point and endeavored to manage it, and we will continue to do that as we go forward. In this period, it was really not a result of changing the offerings within the program. It was really driven by customer behavior and a change in mix. So in this quarter we just had a shift in mix, really, away from the amount that was being redeemed for airlines compared to what we have had in prior quarters. And that's what really drove the weighted average cost per point down in this given period.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: And I know you said before that you don't strive for the lowest loss rate, but rather kind of an economic answer. But could you talk a little about why you've got kind 50-, 60-basis-point increase in charge card losses in the first half of this year versus first half of last year?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So our strategy is to focus on growing spend products, so those would be charge cards, as well as premium lending cards. So as we strove to grow the charge business, to see write-off rates go up a bit is perfectly fine with us as long as we're attracting customer groups that have good long-term economics. And as you know, when you're bringing a lending customer, sometimes it takes 12 to 24 months before the portfolio seasons because people can make minimum payments. In charge card, on the other hand, it's a pay-in-full product, so you see it a lot more quickly. So I think that's part of what drove the increase that we saw through the first quarter. On the other hand, we continue to get focused on what's taking place within our portfolio. And I think that focus is what enabled the write-off rate actually to come down in the second quarter compared to the first. But still, all-in, these are very low write-off rates. And if we can drive the right economics and acquire the right customers, having write-off rates being higher than where they are today are perfectly fine.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. Just one last very quick thing, and that is the ancillary products that you mentioned in -- are those sold through a third party, or do you sell them directly?\nDaniel T. Henry: So which ancillary products?\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: The ones that you're talking about having customer rebates before.\nDaniel T. Henry: I -- so I know -- so I don't know the specific answer to that question. I know we have been focusing on them, and I suspect that at least a portion of them, I think, are sold through our proprietary process. But I don't have a specific split between what's proprietary and what might be with third parties.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to the line of Mike Taiano with Telsey Advisory Group.\nMichael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: So I just wanted to make sure that I understood your question -- the answer on the surcharging question. So as I understand it, so if Visa and MasterCard were to charge, let's just say, 2% -- or if merchants were to charge 2% on a Visa/MasterCard transaction, your rules would not allow merchants to charge a higher amount than that, even if your cost of acceptance to the merchant is higher?\nDaniel T. Henry: Our provision does not prohibit surcharging but requires that the surcharging be on a parity basis so that our cardmembers are not discriminated against at the point of sale. So if someone was charging 2% to our customers, then our contracts would require that any other credit card that's presented would be required to have the same surcharge.\nMichael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Okay. So it's -- they would then have to charge MasterCard or Visa cardholders the same as they're charging you and not vice versa?\nDaniel T. Henry: No. So our contracts cover our cardmembers, right? The Visa and MasterCard rules cover theirs. So if a merchant has a contract with us, it requires that our cardmembers be charged on parity, as I just described, with what -- and that other credit card companies -- other credit cards that are presented would have to have the same surcharge.\nMichael P. Taiano - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Okay, got it. And then just one follow-up on a -- I saw you guys are adopting the EMV standards. Was just curious what you think that impact will be if there is a additional costs that you'll have to incur later this year or early next year on that?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we're going to start issuing cards that have EMV enabled, and we will convert cards over, over a multiyear period. So the cost of doing that will not be in 1 or 2 quarters but would be over a several year period.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: The -- just a comment on the long-term growth model revenue and earnings growth model, if you can. I mean, obviously, your targets are at least 8% revenue growth and 12% to 15% earnings growth. And I think ken suggested looking at 2010 is kind of a base. As we look forward to 2013 and '14, it doesn't seem like the economic trajectory is going to change all that much from here. It certainly doesn't feel like it today. But are you able to -- do you feel good about being able to hit those targets? I mean, you're blowing out your return on equity target pretty significantly. But can you hit those -- the revenue and EPS? Do you feel confident in those targets?\nDaniel T. Henry: So on average and over time, I would think about a 10-year cycle, not a 3- or 4-year cycle. And clearly, in times where economic growth is slow, you would expect to have slower billed business growth in those periods than when you had a robust period. So when we say on average and over time, I think we've looked at it an extended cycle. And over that cycle, I think we're confident that we can achieve those levels, we can achieve our financial targets.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then on spend growth, I mean, your -- you had Continental. How much of an effect has Continental's switch to United had on your billed business?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we had a fair number of initiatives in place last year when the Continental contract expired. We actually were very pleased in terms of what we are able to achieve in terms of retaining customers through those initiatives at the end of the day. And what I would point out is I don't have any specific data on how many customers we may have lost, but what I would say is over the past year, we have continued to build share in the U.S. So in total, we've continued to be successful in the marketplace when you look at the overall population of people who could -- who are using credit and charge cards. And these days, that's our aim is to be successful in terms of financial results and continuing to be able to compete successfully in the marketplace.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then just a last question on Serve, if I could. If you could give some update, I mean, you've invested -- I mean, American Express has invested at least several hundred million dollars to date in Serve, and I know that we haven't seen as many new relationships being announced recently, but when can we get some -- I mean, some information on how successful Serve is being? It seems looking at your numbers and the growth of fee income, it really still seems to be pretty irrelevant, and it's hard to forecast any benefit from that significant investment that you've been making over these last several years.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So I think -- last year was the year we wanted to sign agreements with other businesses that would put Serve in the path of their customers. This year, it's all about getting customers onto the network, and that's what we're focused on. So that's our focus now. In terms of Serve, we are seeing some successful uses of Serve. Certainly by putting our reloadable products on Serve, if we didn't have that platform, our ability to issue the product would have been hampered. We have also entered into agreements in China with Lianlian, where the basis of that is that Lianlian is going to use the Serve platform as part of their mobile pop-up process. So we are seeing spots we're able to use it. I don't think we're at the point yet where we would release financial information, but we continue to make progress against the objectives that we have set for ourselves.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And then I guess as that relates to your fee income targets, I mean, it seems like you're still quite a ways away from hitting your targets on fee income, and it seems like you need to make acquisitions to grow that. Or are you disappointed with the level of fee income growth that you've been able to generate, given the aggressive target?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So our target is to exit, I think, 2014 at a $3 billion run rate. Last year, we had $1.3 billion in fee income. So we continue to make progress in the fee area and against that target. So to the operator, I would say I'll take one last question.\nOperator: And that would be from Brad Ball with Evercore.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Dan, what was the amount of the accrual for refunds in the quarter? And had you accrued any in prior quarters?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we did have an accrual back in the fourth quarter, which we mentioned at that time. As it relates to the accruals in this quarter, we don't plan to disclose the exact dollar amount. We felt that the cost in this quarter were important enough to mention, but not large enough to quantify.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: The adjusted other rose by $110 million year-over-year. Is most of that driven by this accrual?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I would say that there were 2 items that contributed to it. It was this accrual as well as investment impairments that drove it. So those are the 2 big items that are in the increase.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then separately, you continue to show spending on lending products that are growing faster than your overall loan growth, and at the same time, you've got historically strong credit quality. And I'm just wondering when will you start pushing a little harder on loan growth and driving up your net charge-off ratio to a more economically reasonable level? At down at 2.2%, it just seems too low to drive the kind of returns and spending volume growth that you have the potential to get here.\nDaniel T. Henry: So we have never had a target to grow loans, and I don't anticipate that we will in the future. Our focus is to make investments that have good economic returns over time, and they are currently focused on charge card as well as premium lending. So to the extent customers want have the ability to lend and we have the right credit quality, then we want to put investments up against both charge and premium lending, and to the extent we're successful, we will -- may see loan growth increase, but we don't have any specific targets for loan growth. We really target our investments for the greatest economic return over time.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And what would you say is a normalized net charge-off rate?\nDaniel T. Henry: A normalized charge-off rate. So that's what we're going to have to wait and see, all right? So over the past 10 years, it was about 4.5%. So I feel pretty confident, not going too much out on a limb, that it will be less than that going forward. But exactly where it will go from here will be very dependent on both our strategy as well as customer behavior at the end of the day. All right. All right. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and have a good evening.\nOperator: And, ladies and gentlemen, this call will be available for replay after 7 p.m. today through 25 July at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now like to turn the conference over to Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.\nRick Petrino: Thank you. Welcome, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. Before I turn it over to Dan Henry, I want to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements, including the company's financial and other goals, are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2010 10-K report already on file with the SEC. In the first quarter 2012 earnings release and earnings supplement, as well as the presentation slides, all of which are now posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We have provided information that describes certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the company and the comparable GAAP financial information. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will start on Slide 2. So revenue net of interest expense for the quarter was $7.6 billion. That's 8% higher than the first quarter of last year. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue increased 9%. Net income came in at $1,256,000,000. Diluted EPS is $1.07, that's up 10% from last year. And our return on average equity is at 27%. The decrease in shares outstanding that you see is a reflection of our share buyback program. Moving to Slide 3, which are our metric performance, billed business came in at $211 billion. That's an increase of 12% year-over-year and 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. So this year, actually, we have a benefit, we think, from leap year, an extra day. So I would characterize our growth as generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2011, which had growth of about 11%. Cards-in-force is up to 98 million. That's a 7% increase from last year. Cards issued by GNS partners grew 16%. Proprietary cards grew 2%, and so we're up about 1.3 million cards compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.  Average basic card member spending is up 10%. That's continued high engagement by our customers. Loans came in at $60 billion. That's up 4% as it's growing gradually, although I note that spending on lending products is growing faster. And travel sales are up modestly. If we move to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by region. So each region is up modestly, reflecting, I think, again the fact that we had a leap year this year. Excluding that, the growth rates by region are reasonably stable with the fourth quarter. Europe had a growth rate of 6% in this first quarter. In Northern Europe, the growth rates were higher. Germany, for instance, grew at 8%. The U.K. also grew at 8%. Southern Europe was somewhat weaker, low single-digit growth. Spain, for instance, grew at 2%. The growth in each region is similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Moving to Slide 5, so this is billed business growth by segment. So the red line is the total company, and that's at 12%. GNS is the yellow line and continues to be somewhat above the average for the company, and it grew at 17%. International Consumer is the light blue square line, and it's slightly less than the company average coming in at 9% FX adjusted. And that was influenced by the lower growth rate in Europe. U.S. Consumer is the dark blue diamond line, and Global Corporate Services, the green triangle. Here, growth rates are similar to the total company.   Moving over to Slide 6, so this is lending billed business compared to managed loan growth. So the solid line is the growth rate for spending on lending products. The growth in spending on lending products is in line with the overall growth rate in billed business. The dotted line is the growth rate in loans. So we continue to see a difference in the growth rate on lending spending and ending loans, though this gap is narrowing. The relative ratios of growth rates going forward will be a function of lending customers' behavior in the future. I would note, and this is not on the slide, but I note that the net interest yield on loans was 9.2% this quarter, and that's the same as the first quarter of 2011. Slide 7 is revenue performance. So discount revenue increased 9%, and that reflects 12% growth in billed business. While we had a 2-basis point decrease in the discount rate from 2.55% in the first quarter of 2011 to 2.35% this quarter, and this is driven by our strategy to increase penetration into everyday spend categories, as well as the mix of spending. It was also impacted by the relatively faster growth in GNS, and as you know, GNS, a portion of that discount rate we share with our GNS partners. It's also impacted by higher contra-revenues, including volume-related incentives to corporate customers and higher cash back rewards. Card fees grew in line with the growth in proprietary cards-in-force. Travel commissions and fees reflect slightly higher sales and slightly lower commissions and supplier revenues. Other commission fees are 10% higher, primarily reflecting the full quarter of Loyalty Partner. So we have 3 months in this quarter. Last year, we just had one month, and that's partially offset by lower foreign exchange conversion revenue.  Other revenue increased 22%. So this reflects higher royalty revenues from GNS partner and also reflects the benefit in revision of our estimate for un-cashed TCs in international markets. Net interest income is up 6%, and this is driven by a 4% increase in card member loans. So total revenues grew at 8%. This is a reflection of our spend-centric model and enables our growth rate to be faster than our issuing competitors. Slide 8 is provision for losses. We could see that the Charge Card provision is $178 million, 10% lower than last year. So the write-off rate is up slightly as we are growing our business, but still at very low levels compared to historic numbers. But the write-off dollars in the first quarter of 2012 are higher than what we had in 2011, and that's offset by lower fraud and the fact that we had a $14 million reserve release in the first quarter of 2012 compared to a reserve build of $35 million in the first quarter of 2011. Turning to the lending provision, that came in at $212 million, which compares to a credit of $120 million in the first quarter of 2011. The write-off rate is lower in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, and you'll see that in a couple of slides. So we have lower write-off dollars in the quarter. And as you can see on this slide, reserve releases this quarter were $194 million and that compares to $725 million in the first quarter of 2011. And that difference is really driving the higher provision year-over-year. Improvement in the delinquency rate again this quarter and improvement in the migration rate is what drove the reserve release this quarter. Moving to Slide 9, so this is Charge Card credit performance. So the write-off rate in the Charge Card portfolio have increased slightly, both sequentially and compared to last year, but again remains at near historic low levels. Despite the higher write-off rate in USCS, the delinquency rate remains stable and our reserve coverage of delinquencies also remains stable. International Consumer and Global Corporate Services is up slightly, but again here, at near historic lows.  Moving to Slide 10, so this is lending credit performance. So the lending write-off rate is at 2.3% this quarter, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2011 and notably better than the first quarter of last year. The lending 30-day past due improved slightly sequentially to 1.4% and compares favorably to the 1.9% in the first quarter of 2011. These are both at historical low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. Moving to Slide 11, so this is a chart related to lending reserve coverage. So U.S. Card Services and Worldwide, reserves as a percentage of loans and reserves as a percentage of past due were less than we had in the first quarter of 2011, and that's driven by improved credit performance and are both approximately the same or slightly lower than what we had in the fourth quarter of 2011. Now principal month's coverage was 15.9x in the U.S. and 15.8x worldwide in the fourth quarter of 2011, and they have both moved to 14 months coverage in the first quarter of this year. So this calculation, as you take write-offs in the quarter, you divide by 3 to get a monthly average and you divide it into the reserve balance.  So write-offs in the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2011 are about the same. But reserves in the first quarter of this year are lower, driven by the improvement in delinquency rates and improved migration rates that I've discussed before. So we move to Slide 12, so this is our expense performance. So total expenses increased 4% or adjusted for the Visa and MasterCard settlement were flat in the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2011. Marketing and promotion decreased 11% from last year. In the quarter, marketing and promotion, as a percentage of revenues, was about 8.3%, and this is below the historical level of 9%. Our plan for the full year is for marketing and promotion to be approximately 9% of revenues. However, as we've said in the past, we will adjust marketing spend depending on economic conditions. Membership Rewards expense decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2011, reflecting greater membership rewards and co-brand card-related expense on spending volume in the quarter, but was more than offset by lower increases in the membership reward ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. And I'll discuss this in more detail on the next slide.  Card member Services increased 35%, reflecting increased cost associated with benefits recently provided to U.S. card members, including statement credits for travel fees for Platinum and Centurion card members, the Delta Companion program and lounge access. I'll discuss operating expense on Slide 14.   The effective tax rate of 29% compares to 32% in the first quarter of last year, and this lower rate reflects a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits. So now we look at Slide 13, which is comparing card member rewards expense in the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011. Now as you saw on Slide 12, rewards expense is 7% lower in the first quarter of 2012, and you can see that on this slide as well. So card member rewards expense includes the cost of co-brand products and Membership Rewards. I'd like to remind you, for co-brand products, the program partner has the obligation to deliver the reward, repay the co-brand partner each month the amount we expense and have no balance sheet liability. On the other hand, we are responsible for delivering the rewards earned under the Membership Rewards program and have a balance sheet reserve for that. At year end, that was approximately $5 billion. So Membership Rewards expense is a function of 2 elements. The cost of points earned in the quarter and expense for points earned in previous periods if the estimate for the ultimate redemption rate changes.    In this chart, the blue section includes the co-brand product expense and the MR rewards expense for points earned in the quarter. The green section represents MR expense, Membership Rewards expense, related to points earned in previous periods due to the increase in the estimate of the ultimate redemption rate. You can see that the green section of the bar in the first quarter of 2012 is significantly smaller than in the first quarter of 2011.  So the more moderate increase in the ultimate redemption rate is resulting in lower total rewards expense in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011. In 2012, we continue to see increased customer engagement in the Membership Rewards program, resulting in a higher ultimate redemption rate estimate, but at a rate of change more in line with historic levels prior to 2011.  So I'll move to operating expense on Slide 14. So total operating expense grew 13%. Excluding the impact of the Visa/MasterCard settlement, which was a credit last year, adjusted operating expense increased 5%. So salaries and benefits grew 7%, reflecting merit increases, higher incentive-related compensation and higher benefits-related costs.   Professional services increased 4%. This is due to higher technology costs and higher third-party agent commissions, which relate to signing smaller merchants, offset by lower collection costs. Occupancy equipment increased 11%, and this includes costs associated with Loyalty Partner and higher data processing costs.   Adjusted other, net decreased 16%, primarily due to a reclass, and we're reclassing a benefit related to cross-currency funding hedges in the period. So I'll move to Slide 15, again, talking to operating expense. So this slide provides 8 quarters of history on operating expense. At $3.1 billion in this quarter, we believe this is the level of operating expense that will enable us to drive business growth. Going forward, we will continue to implement our plan to contain the operating expenditures. When we think about 2012, you should also be mindful that the first quarter of 2011 was the low point for operating expenses in 2011 as you can see on this chart. You can also see that operating expenses were similar in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Now I'm not making the forecast here, but if operating expenses stay at the current level, the growth rate for the full year, adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds, would be in the low single digits. Our objective over the next 2 or 3 years will be to grow operating expenses more slowly than the growth in revenues. Moving to Slide 16, so this is regarding expense flexibility over time. So this slide shows adjusted expense as a percentage of revenue. Now adjusted expense excludes credit provision. On the left side of slide, you can see 5 years of history, and on the right side, the past 5 quarters. So adjusted expense, as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of this year, continues to come down from the historically high levels that we saw in 2010 and '11. Over time, we expect this ratio to migrate back towards historical levels in 2 ways: first, through top line revenue growth; and second, through expense flexibility which includes our plan to contain operating expense growth.  I'll now move to Slide 17, which are our capital ratios. You can see that Tier 1 common ratio increased to 13.4% from 12.3% at year end. We generated additional capital through net income and employee plans, and at the same time, risk weighted assets decreased, mostly due to lower loan levels. Share repurchases did not start until mid-March, after the Fed completed their review of our capital distribution plan. As we continue to execute against our plan to return capital to shareholders and potentially pursue acquisition opportunities, we would expect that that Tier 1 common ratio would move down in subsequent quarters.   Slide 18, our payout ratio. So this is the total payout ratio, and the bars represent the percentage of capital generated that we return to shareholders. On the left side is the last 5 years, and on the right side is the past 4 quarters. In 2011, which is the middle of the chart, we returned 56% of capital to shareholders, and this is in line with our stated objective of returning approximately 50% of capital generated to shareholders. So the Fed has reviewed our 2012 capital distribution plan, along with 18 other large bank holding companies, including the operating performance of all 19 banks under stressed economic conditions. We believe the results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and our balance sheet. For example, our minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio, a measure of balance sheet strength, was the third highest among all 19 banks. While looking at measures of operating performance under these stressed scenarios, we were best in class among the 19 participants.   Our capital plan is to return capital to shareholders. Our capital plan of returning capital to shareholders is both through our dividend, which we increased to $0.20 per share per quarter from $0.18, and we'll also use share repurchases in an amount up to $4 billion in 2012 and $1 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Next is Slide 19, a liquidity snapshot. So we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet 12 months of funding maturities. We have $20 billion of excess cash and securities. The next month of maturities is $13 billion. So this is larger than our normal excess and has been driven by the seasonal decline in loans in the first quarter, continued strong growth in our direct deposits, which you'll see on the next slide, and an unsecured debt issuance at the end of March under favorable capital market conditions. So Slide 20 is our U.S. retail deposits by type. As we have limited cash needs in the first quarter, total retail deposits increased only $20 million. You can see that on the right-hand side of the chart. We did increase direct deposits by $1.2 billion. You can see that on the left side of the chart, while third-party CDs decreased by $1.1 billion. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. Results for the quarter reflect the continuation of the positive business trends evident during the last several quarters, as well as continued execution against our plan to migrate towards historic expense to revenue ratios. Spending growth remains strong and we continue to grow above the average rate of our large issuing competitors despite difficult prior year comparisons. Given the challenging global economic environment, we are pleased with the strength of international billings growth, including in Europe, where we saw a modest increase in the growth rate. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year, with net yield comparable to the prior year and lending growth and a growth in net interest income of 6%. At the same time, lending loss rate remains stable near all-time lows. Despite very strong credit performance, provision expense did increase as lending reserve releases were significantly lower this year compared to the prior year. Our strong billings growth, the growth in net interest income and higher other non-interest revenues drove revenue growth in line with our on average and over time target of 8%. Our revenue growth, which reflects the benefit of our spend-centric model, stands in contrast to many other issuance that still face year-over-year revenue declines. In the first quarter, strong revenue growth was paired with well-contained total expense growth to generate strong earnings. We are still investing in the business, and these investments are driving higher average spending and growth in our card base, while enabling us to build capabilities for the future. In addition, we are continuing to implement our plan to grow operating expense more slowly than revenues over the next 2 to 3 years. Looking ahead, we recognize that the year-over-year comparisons will continue to be difficult and that we will not have the benefit of the Visa/MasterCard settlement proceeds or significant credit reserve releases, but we continue to believe that our business model is well positioned for the challenges ahead. In fact, the results of the recent Fed stress tests further demonstrate the unique aspects of our model and highlights its inherent flexibility and the ability to generate capital even under severe stress assumptions. We have started our share buyback program, increased our dividend and maintained flexibility as we considered balancing acquisitions and share buybacks.   Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to the first line of Nomura.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: It's Brian Foran. I wonder if you could -- maybe just given how things are evolving in Europe, any color or thoughts you have on more recent customer behavior there? Are you still seeing the improvement you saw hold up or are you seeing starting to weaken again?\nDaniel T. Henry: So the fourth quarter, we had loan growth -- not loan growth, billed business growth that was kind of in the mid-single digits. What we're seeing then is that we had stronger growth in the northern part of Europe. We had somewhat slower growth in the southern part of Europe. The U.K. was performing more in line with what we saw in Northern Europe. Actually, that trend has continued into the first quarter. So we had overall growth in Europe of 6%, stronger in Northern Europe and the U.K., a little less so in the south. So I would say the trend in the first quarter was very comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. So some stabilization.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I guess I don't know if it's something you can comment on, but do all those comments carry through to April as well or things evolve since then?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, absolutely the last couple of weeks, so we're not going to comment on April at this time.\nBrian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then the follow-up I had was, I realized Charge Card performance is very strong in a historical context, but just any more color on why loss rates are trending up over the past 4 quarters? Anything you're observing in the data?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So the overall growth rate is 12%. We actually have very similar growth rates in lending and charge, so they both are seeing very strong growth. The tick up that we saw up to 2.3% in the first quarter this year is really a pretty minor tick up, and at 2.3% represents very low levels compared to what we've historically seen. We did notice that and we took a close look at delinquencies. And so delinquencies this quarter stand at 1.9%. And that's exactly the same delinquency rate that we had in the fourth quarter and very comparable to what we had last year. So we don't have a concern about where write-offs are. In fact, it's our expectation, as we grow the business, that we would expect to see some tick up over time in the write-off rates, both potentially in charge and in lending. But when that will happen will be dependent on the growth in the business and customer behavior. So bottom line is that tick up is not a concern to me.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Citigroup.\nDonald Fandetti: Moving on to the regulatory environment, I mean, clearly, your fundamentals are great. If you could just talk a little bit about maybe the CFPB and what kind of interactions you've had with them and what they might -- where, if any, concerns you might have from the regulatory side?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, we started to engage with the CFPB. They are, I think, on site at this juncture. They're just starting their work. So I think it's going to be some time before we have findings from them or reports from them. The findings that the FDIC has had, which we disclosed in the 10-K, they have shared those with the CFPB. We have not heard back from them on any reaction to that. They're a new regulator, so like everyone else, we're going to have to wait and see exactly what their observations are. But we have started to engage with them. We have a number of new regulators from [indiscernible] the bank holding company. The Fed was a new regulator for us. We have worked very hard with the Fed to establish good relations. We think we've been successful at doing that. Our plan would be to do the same exact thing with the CFPB, to be open with them and listen to any observations that they have.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And just real quickly, it looks like there was a reclassification of card fees out of net interest income. Can you talk a little bit about that?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So this is -- sorry, I was getting a little help there. So there were some card fees that came with bank holding company. We decided should be included in interest income. Upon further review, we have decided that we should put it back into card fees. So there's no change in revenues at all or the economics or the bottom line. It's just a classification of what revenue line that it's on.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And what kind of card fees were those?\nDaniel T. Henry: It's just the annual fee that we get on lending products, and there was an interpretation of a certain accounting rule that we thought would cause us to move, to split the card fees and put a portion up in interest income, but I have decided that, that is not where we should put it, and so we've really just reclassed it back. Simply low economics. There's no impact on the total revenue line or on the bottom line. And we restated the prior year.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Just 2 things. Could you tell us was there any effect on expenses because of the extra day for leap year? Is it really just the revenue effect?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I would have answered that question no, but this is like more of an issue that we should really get into here, but we actually do accrue some salaries kind of on a day basis, so there might have been a slight impact on salaries and benefits as a result of that. But I don't think there's any large impact at all here. Since you have another day of spending, you get it on the revenue level. Rewards will be an example to the extent you have more billed business, you're going to have some more rewards.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And then can you just clarify what the adjustment for the Traveler Cheque liability was, how much that could be? And then you do note in the supplement expenses for Enterprise Growth? Can you give us a sense of how much that is in the quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, so Travelers Cheques, to the extent that there are travelers cheques that are sold in the U.S., if customers do not redeem them, we sheet those to the States. So there's no income related to that. However, for travelers cheques that are sold outside of the United States, other countries do not have a stringent law. And so we estimate how much of those travelers cheques will not be redeemed. We actually pick up an estimate of that at the time we sell the travelers' cherub. We then step back and look at history and to see where the things are performing the way they have historically done. In a recent review this quarter, we realized that in fact fewer of those cheques were being encashed if they were older, and so we simply revise our estimates of the amount that will not be encashed. And there was a credit in this quarter related to that.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And about how much was it?\nDaniel T. Henry: So it's small enough -- it's a big enough number that we should mention, but not a large enough number that we'd give the dollar amount.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Less than a $0.01 a share? Less than a $0.05 a share?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I'll just say, we wanted to know it, because it's not inconsequential, but it's not significant. In terms of Enterprise Growth, we haven't disclosed the exact amount we're spending there. We do think that it represents a very good, an important opportunity for us. And so we are investing against those initiatives. At this point, they are investments that aren't generating large amounts of revenue. Anytime you start a new business, you need to continue to calibrate. Some things work less well than you thought, others better than you thought. And we shift our investments accordingly. So we are making notable investments in Enterprise Growth because it's a terrific opportunity. But again, the final number that we disclose.\nDavid S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Right. I figured I might as well ask because you have it in the supplement. And then can you just give us a sense of what we should expect for the tax rate for the balance of the year?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think the tax rate, absent any specific credits in the period that occur, is generally in the low 30s, 31%, 32%. And then to the extent there's a credit like we had this quarter, that benefit will be reflected in the rate. So without any item like that would be in the 31%, 32% range.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of John Stilmar with SunTrust.\nJohn W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just real quickly, Enterprise Growth seems to be certainly the buzzword around American Express. Can you talk to us about a little bit of advancements that you've made in the quarter and what sort of roadmaps and things we should be thinking about in terms of announcements or progress or really frankly numerical -- numbers trying to come up to the surface in terms of progress that you've made on Enterprise Growth?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, I think, our whole businesses is kind of a buzzword, right? So our core business is performing exceptionally well, as you could see by a strong billed business, very good revenue growth, excellent credit performance. And the digital space, which is where Enterprise Growth is, is also a big factor in our core business. So we are doing a significant number of things in the core business. I think you can see the things that we've done with small businesses. I think we've done a number of initiatives with Facebook and Twitter, in Serve, but also in our core business. We're also enabling our customers that want to interact with us from a servicing perspective online to do that. We're also enabling people who want to acquire cards to do it online. So digital and American Express is a buzzword. We think it's important that we think about transforming the company because digital will be a big part of the future. As we've said, it's actually a big part of today. Digital spending is, last year was $130 billion of our $800 billion. So it's an important part of things that we're thinking about and investing in. Within Serve and Enterprise Growth, we are also investing there as I said. So some of the progress we're making as we've said is, we were very focused last year on signing distribution deals. And this year, it's all about executing against those distribution deals so that we can bring customers on to the Serve platform. We're very focused on that, and we haven't at this juncture decided on sharing metrics. At some point in the future, we will. And we'll really, you mentioned revenues, and again, I think this is an area where, of investment, revenues will flow more in the future. But to your point, we're not just investing without monitoring and assessing how we're doing. And so we do have guideposts out there that we're very focused on in terms of what we're achieving and what parts are being successful and which ones aren't. And as I said before, we will calibrate our investments accordingly. But we do think we're accomplishing very positive things.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Brad Ball with Evercore.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Dan, I have a quick follow-up to that. Can you give us a sense as to what portion of billed business growth came from online and mobile?\nDaniel T. Henry: We don't do that by quarter. But as I said, $130 million of the $800 million last year was digital online. And last year, we saw the digital growth at 22% of billings. So billings on the Internet were up 22%. I don't know the exact number for this quarter, but I strongly suspect it's, in all likelihood, growing at a faster rate than the average.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So faster than the 12% or 11% adjusted for the leap day?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I haven't actually seen the number, Brad, but I would think that it probably is. Very strong growth.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And then just as a follow-up to that, a point of clarification. So you have board authorization and approval from the Fed for a buyback of up to $4 billion this year and up to $1 billion next year, but you talk about returning 50% of your capital to shareholders. So those amounts would exceed that 50%. So are those numbers just out there as sort of upside ranges? And if you don't exhaust the full $4 billion this year, is there a need to carry over into next year? How does that work?\nDaniel T. Henry: So our overall philosophy here is to retain 50% of capital generated to grow the business, either supporting growth in the balance sheet, you need capital to do that, or for acquisitions. And to return the other 50% in the form of either dividends or share buybacks. To the extent we do less acquisitions, then we wanted to have the flexibility to do share buybacks. In 2011, we requested $2.3 billion of buybacks on the basis that we'd do about $2 billion in acquisitions. At the end of the day, based on the opportunities we saw, we did $900 million in acquisitions. And as a result, we've built over $1 billion of capital that we haven't planned on. So we made the submission this year. We did it on the basis that we would have the flexibility to do acquisitions if we identified the right opportunities, but also asked for a buyback amount of $4 billion in the event that we didn't do the planned level of acquisitions. So you're right, if we actually do $4 billion of share buybacks, we will be returning a significantly higher percentage of capital generated to shareholders. But it's really a trade-off between acquisition spending and buybacks. The less we do in acquisitions, the more we do in buybacks. The more we do in acquisitions, the less we do in buybacks.\nBradley G. Ball - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And if you don't exhaust the $4 billion, would it carry over into next year or are you back into the submission process in January of next year so you have to see what the Fed will approve?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I have not asked them that question, but I would assume that if we do less than $4 billion, there's not a carryover. We would do a submission next January and then that will become effective, whatever that plan is will become effective after the approval, which would be mid-March, I assume. And what you're allowed to do in 2013 will be based on the plan you submit and whether the Fed does not object to that plan. So I don't think there's a carryover except if you didn't do it, you may wind up with higher capital going in, which might give you greater flexibility in your submission.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Question on expenses, on clarity, and then tie that to growth because, I mean, over the last several years as American Express laid out very well, you were investing very heavily the benefits from lower falling credit losses in the Visa/MasterCard payments. Now you talked about the $3.1 billion of expenses in the quarter, Dan, Pages 15 and 16, and I mean I think -- and while it's clear you're going to grow expenses slower than revenue, it sounded like that $3 billion was -- as you were suggesting, that was going to be kind of a steady run rate for the year. And then, I mean, just as that ties to growth, you had -- I mean, you grew 8% historically. You've said at least 8% revenue growth is what American Express had targeted prior to the downturn. Can you still get this? Can you still drive the revenue growth with pulling back on the investment spend? So 2 questions.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, okay. So we knew all along that, as you said, we were spending at higher levels in 2010 and '11. And that was helping to drive growth. But at the operating expense level that we have, which is higher than we had in the beginning of 2010 or in the first quarter of 2011, at this level, we think we have sufficient resources to drive growth going forward. So it's higher than it was back in those periods, but we think it's a level that is appropriate and would enable us to drive revenue to achieve our on-average and over-time targets. So that's our perspective. We're going to control them well, but we think we have the resources.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And the $3.1 billion this quarter through the year is, I mean, were you suggesting on Page 15 that -- I mean, I wasn't totally clear and you pointed out last year was lower in the first quarter then grew. Are you -- I mean I think it sounded like you might be suggesting that the $3 billion was going to be kind of a run rate for this year before you grow next year or did I misread it?\nDaniel T. Henry: So it's going to be -- not to give a forecast, all right, so I don't want to do that. As you know, we don't do that. But I was simply making the observation that if operating expense continued at the current level and you adjusted for the Visa/MasterCard proceeds and then you took that number and compared it to last year, that you would have low single-digit growth, right? So I wasn't saying exactly what it's going to be, but I was trying to illustrate if it was at that level what the growth rate would be, which is in line with we've talked about being -- containing operating expense growth. But we do believe that at that level, that we have the resources necessary to continue to grow the business and achieve our on-average and over-time financial targets.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: So there's one follow-up on the one, I mean, quarter overall look very impressive, but the one number that surprised me that was weaker was the travel number, travel growth. And it seems like all the data, market data we look at on travel spend look like very strong growth, MasterCard and Visa giving out some very strong cross-border spend numbers. Is there a -- within GSS, the commercial business, was there a significant client loss? Or what happened to your travel business that doesn't match with the market data and the competitive data we've heard?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so I think sales were actually up slightly, but commissions were down a bit and supplier revenues, which are an important part of the economics, sometimes are lumpy. And they were down a little year-over-year. So sales, again, I guess are the key thing in this discussion about just volumes and they were off low single digits. But that's the travel experience. I don't think we had major losses that I'm aware of, but those are the volumes that we were at.\nRobert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Because it looked like you lost some share, but you're not sure why.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I wouldn't comment on share, it's more kind of a client by client is what you're doing when dealing with corporate clients, but certainly, sales for business travel were lower than what we experienced in billed business and our Card business. So that's a fair comparison.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: Wanted to ask you about the Membership Rewards costs. In the fourth quarter, you made a comment discussing roughly 78 basis points as a percentage of billed business ex-GNS to think of for that cost, and that we can think of that for '12. In the first quarter, it was up around 81 and I was curious if you're still thinking about that level for the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, for the year to average out or should we be thinking about that a little differently? And additionally, can we expect going forward dividends to grow at a rate similar to earnings which I believe had been your history prior to the recession?\nDaniel T. Henry: So let me answer the second question first. So that's exactly right. So we think about that we want to have dividends at a certain relationship to income and we kind of keep it in the 17% or 18% range. So if net income increases, then we would stay with the same philosophy and increase dividends to be in line with that percentage that I talked about, 16%, 17%, 18%. So that's exactly right. And as you point out, I mean, you can calculate the numbers. It was 78% -- 78 basis points in the last quarter and 81 basis points in this first quarter. So it's really somewhat dependent on what's happening with the ultimate redemption rate. And if you look over time, if you had, if you look at the schedule, if you look back to, say, the second quarter of 2010, many of the quarters are between this 78-basis point range and 81 basis points. The only time it's really gone above that were in the quarters of 2011 where we had higher growth in the ultimate redemption rate in each quarter than we have seen historically. So in this quarter, the ultimate redemption rate growth was more similar to the historical levels that we saw prior to 2011. But where it goes is going to be totally dependent on customer behavior. As we've said, the ultimate redemption rate goes up when we see redemption levels go up -- if we see redemption levels go up, that's greater engagement to the long-term health of the franchise. That's a very good thing. It puts some expense in the quarter, but it's very good for the long-term health of the franchise.\nCraig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division: So it sounds like we should think about a range similar to what you said, 78 basis points to 82 basis points or so at least for this year.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I didn't say exactly. You said -- but I did give you those data points.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Question on the share repurchase. I was just wondering, as far as like timing and the M&A pipeline, I was wondering, I mean, could you just talk about that pipeline and how we should model in the share repurchase to the extent that there are opportunities available? And you guys may not kind of push the lever too hard on share repurchase. And then secondarily, on top line growth, I was wondering if you could just talk about billed business growth going forward. It seemed like you guys had some decent momentum in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, but the comps obviously get tougher as the year progresses. How confident are you that you keep that momentum going? And then just finally on the top line growth, can you just talk about the contra-revenue items as well? Are there any big kind of contra-revenue items that we should think about and how they trend over the course of the year?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So starting with share buybacks and acquisitions. So as you know, we have not relied on acquisitions to drive our growth. It's been primarily driven by organic growth and our investments in our business. Our philosophy is to do what I refer to as bolt-on type acquisitions, where we either acquire a capability that we can leverage within our existing business or acquire near-in adjacencies that are fee-based in nature. Loyalty Partner would be a good example of that. So our philosophy is that we want to take a look at acquisitions that fall within those parameters. If we see good acquisitions with good economics, then we're going to make those acquisitions. But if we don't identify acquisitions that meet our criteria, we're not going to do them for the sake of doing acquisitions. So what we actually do in 2012 will be calibrated by the opportunities we see and the assessments we make of the economics. We see good acquisitions, we'll do them. If not, we'll use the capital to do share buybacks. Now in terms of billed business, we think we have had excellent billed business over the past 2 years. Certainly, excellent compared to the industry. We've had 9 quarters in a row where we've had double-digit growth in billed business. Certainly, really excellent compared to the industry. And we continue to believe that we have sufficient resources to continue to drive strong growth and have business momentum going forward. So I think where we're constructing our plan is to continue to drive spend, focus on our spend-centric model and to be successful in the future in terms of taking share as we have been over the last decade. In terms of contra-revenues, so contra-revenues include cash rewards. As I mentioned, those are up this quarter. We issued recently a new product that was a cashback product. That higher reward level would indicate as being successful in the marketplace. We do give volume incentives to certain corporate customers. So to the extent they're hitting higher levels of spend, that's a good thing economically, but it is a contra-revenue. We also have, sometimes, signing bonuses that go in the slide. This quarter, that wasn't at a higher level than we've seen historically. And for the other impact on the relationship between billed business and discount rate is GNS, right. So GNS is a terrific success story. We share a part of the revenue with our partners. We keep some to ourselves. That has the impact of bringing down, creating a gap in that relationship. So those are the largest items that are impacting the difference between billed business and discount revenue within our P&L.\nOperator: You do have a question from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRichard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: The one item in the expenses that was a little bit surprising directionally was the occupancy and equipment. And the reason I say that is, it's my recollection that this is the quarter where the Greensboro shutdown actually goes into effect. Was there any lingering expense associated with Greensboro or is this net of that shutdown, and the other facilities that you added actually more than offset it?\nDaniel T. Henry: So it really doesn't have anything to do with Greensboro. The things -- the costs we were going to incur related to that, that were people related we accrued upfront. There are no notable Greensboro expenses in here. We have largely wound that down at this juncture. So that is not a factor in this quarter. So you're asking me if that was lower because we don't have Greensboro, is that the question?\nRichard B. Shane - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm sorry you got muted out in the middle of that, but my question is I'm surprised that occupancy went up this quarter on a year-over-year basis. It was the only expense where you didn't really show a degree of operating leverage. So I'm curious with that coming out. What the incremental expense was?\nDaniel T. Henry: I got you, okay. So Greensboro is not a large factor here in the year-over-year comparison just from a occupancy cost perspective. The reason it's up is Loyalty Partner is part of it. So we had, again, 3 months in here for their occupancy as opposed to only 1 month last year. And we do have some -- so this is occupancy and equipment. So the equipment part is we do have some higher data processing costs, which are just related to the higher volumes that we're experiencing and the fact that we continue to invest in capabilities. So those are the things that are the main drivers of the increase of 11%.\nOperator: And you do have a question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: We've got a follow-up question on your capital plans. By our estimate, under the plan, you have the ability to pay back up to about 100% of earnings. Given that you're already sitting on a pretty large capital cushion of in excess of $2 billion and loan growth has been moderate and M&A has not been that big of a part of your business recently, was there any thought of asking for a payout in excess of 100% so you could start to draw down some of that cushion?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think if you look at schedules that investment banks have put together, we probably are at the high end in terms of what we requested in terms of buybacks. We were sitting at 12.3%, right, at the end of last year in terms of Tier 1 common. So for the moment, that's a comfortable place to be. We don't know what all of the final rules will be as relates to what capital we'll be required to hold. In addition to that, we are still in the process of looking at Basel II, so we don't know completely what impacts that could potentially have on us. Well we simply go from Basel I to Basel III. There's not a big impact there. We've disclosed those numbers, but we've yet to complete our work on Basel II. Once the rules are completed and we have a full assessment of the impact of Basel and the ultimate rules that are out there, we'll think about exactly where we want to settle. But we didn't contemplate asking for higher buybacks to actually take the ratio down beyond what our plan that we submitted was.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. If you -- if M&A was a meaningful part of your plans for this year, would you still contemplate potentially using the full authorization and bring your ratio down in that course?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think if we did a modest level of acquisitions, we would probably tend towards the higher end of the $4 billion range. If we do higher levels of acquisitions, then we would bring the $4 billion down correspondingly.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Ken Bruce with Merrill Lynch.\nKenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My question relates to several that have been asked, but would like to maybe get you to step back for a second and give us a sense around the expense management. How long do you think it will take for your adjusted expenses to get back to the historical norm? Obviously, there's a couple different things that can ultimately drive those down. But I'm wondering how long you think they're going to remain elevated before you get down to that 67% level?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, okay. So we said we were going to head back towards those levels, right? And in that calculation, provision is not an element. So to the extent going forward, provision is a lower percentage of revenues than it was historically if that were the case. Then really to kind of achieve the kind of margins we want, you wouldn't have to get all the way back to 67%. So we'll calibrate things based on both of those factors. I think we've made very good progress to date. We've gotten back to 71% in this quarter. So I think we're making very good progress. I won't forecast exactly what the ratios will be going forward, but as you intimated in your question, we can really get there 1 or 2 ways, right. We can get there through very good containment of expenses and we can also get there by good revenue growth. And to the extent we get good revenue growth, then we actually have more flexibility in terms of the level of operating expenses that we have. So we want to calibrate all these pieces together so that we have strong growth with the right margins and the right returns for shareholders. So I think you consider all those things as we move forward. But we think the progress that we've made is good and we think we have thoughtful plans in place as we go forward.\nKenneth Bruce: Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, when you look at the new businesses that you're investing in, I think you've made some comments in the past that those are very decent margin businesses. They may look different than your historical business. Your margins in the quarter were down 23% and change I think from 24%. Do you think that, at some point, your pretax operating margin begins to drift higher or do you think -- what would you kind of say is the stable level when you look at your new business investments beginning to actually kind of kick in?\nDaniel T. Henry: It's a little hard to assess since we have to actually see exactly what the structure is for revenues. We've run scenarios, and in those scenarios, we have good economics associated with those. But exactly how that whole space will play out will take honestly a couple of years to do and we'll see what margins we have. We think about financial returns, we think about growth, we think about margins, we think about return on equity. So the total economics across all those metrics could be somewhat different or similar to what we have today and we'll have to wait and see exactly how they play out. But we think it's a sector that will have high growth in the future. We think we have the capabilities to be successful in that space, and we think the returns will be good. And concerning all those things are the reason that we're making the investments in that space.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Dan, I was looking at the slide, I think it's Slide 12 that had -- 13 actually that had the rewards expense. And the green part of the bar that represented the increase for points previously earned, you had mentioned that, that was $188 million in 2011. So if you were to subtract that, the total amount for the first quarter this year is only less than 6% higher. So I guess, how do we kind of square those numbers given that you've got 12% growth in Charge volume and you're saying that there is some increase in the liability on top of that?\nDaniel T. Henry: I think the green bar for the first quarter of 2011 actually has 2 pieces in it. One, we revised the estimation process in which we -- under which we actually did the ultimate redemption calculation. That was the $188 million. Also in that quarter, just in the normal course, based on the behavior of the customers, the ultimate redemption rate increased for that as well. So the green bar includes both of those pieces, not just the $188 million.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And also on the Slide 11, on credit, you've gone from 16 months coverage of principal down to 14. And that's kind of a concurrent measure, not a prospective one. So I would assume that you're not going to take that all the way down to 12 if receivables are growing and there's potential for dollars of losses to go up at some point in the not-too-distant future. How much room do you have to take that 14 down or from the standpoint of the reserve at this point?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes. So for us, this calculation was really just an outcome of how we set reserves. So we don't target a particular level of coverage. We set reserves. We have a migration model that we look at using history. If there are a need for specific reserves with something that's not captured there, we include that. We have some higher reserves for TDRs. So that is what drives where we set reserves, not this metric. This is simply an outcome. It's one that people follow, so we've provided, but it's not a driver of how we set reserves. Reserves are going to be driven by the behavior of our customer, what delinquencies are, what the migration rates are. So that's what's driving our reserves.\nMoshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: All right. Does that essentially mean your migration says that dollar losses are coming down in the future?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, not in the future, right. So if you look at this quarter, the migration rates were better in this quarter than they were in the fourth quarter of 2011. We're using history, right. We're using a certain period of history to help guide us there.  Okay. So thanks, everybody, for joining the call, and good evening.\nOperator: Thank you.

All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss the solid results across our businesses that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013. Our performance in the quarter reflected healthy billed business intense revenue growth, a continuation of credit metrics being at historic lows, disciplined controlled operating expenses and as a result, solid earnings performance.  Since this quarter does mark the end of the full year, I will be discussing our full year results, which we are also pleased with, as they help illustrate some important trends. During the quarter, we made several significant announcements in particular around signing new GNS partnerships and reaching separate settlement agreements with our merchants and regulators. In addition, we helped support small business entity for the fourth consecutive year. I will discuss some of these initiatives in more detail later on the call. I would say that there was some complexity to understanding our financial results this quarter. While the merchant settlement is the most significant new item, we also have a number of previously disclosed items that make the year-over-year comparisons more complex, including last year\u2019s fourth quarter items, the sale of our publishing business at the beginning of October and the few other specific items which I will walk you through as I discuss our results. To begin with the summary of our Q4 results, you can see on Slide 2 that FX adjusted billed business growth was 9%. Given our spend centric business model, this was in the primary driver of our FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%. Both of these rates of growth are modestly above our full year growth levels, reflecting the uptick in the economy and our business that we saw as 2013 progressed. This level of revenue growth combined with our continued strong operating expense control this year drove net income to $1.3 billion in the quarter. This was up sharply from the prior year of course due to the items we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our strong capital position allowed us to continue our share repurchase efforts, over the last four quarters we have spend $4 billion buying back shares, which cumulatively resulted in our average shares outstanding declining by 4% versus the prior year. To more meaningfully review the impact of these solid operating results and our share repurchase efforts on EPS, it\u2019s important to realize that year-over-year comparisons are impacted by the three items recorded during the fourth quarter of last year, as well as this year\u2019s merchant settlement. Regarding the settlement which we announced in late December, it resulted in expenses that lowered fourth quarter EPS this year by approximately $0.04, adjusted for this merchant settlement this year and the three items from the prior year, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter increased from a $1.09 to $1.25. These solid results helped bring ROE for the period ending -- for the period ending December 31st to 28%. Overall, we feel good about our performance in the quarter, especially considering the continued moderate pace of the economic recovery. Turning now to the full year results for 2013 on slide three. For context, as we enter 2013, there are number questions about our ability to grow revenues and earnings per share in a slow growth environment. As you recall, billings and revenue growth have slowed over the second half of 2012 and there were concerns about the impact of tax increases and the microeconomic environment on our card that were base. In fact, 2013 did turn out to be a year of only modest economic growth. While we are encouraged by the recent strong sequential increase seen in the U.S. GDP growth rates, it is important to remember that the year-over-year increase in U.S. GDPs are in the first three quarters of 2013 was just 1.3%, 1.6% and 2.0%. It is this year-over-year increase that relates historically to our billed business growths. Given this challenging economic environment, we were please to be able to generate FX adjusted billings growth of 8% over the full year and FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%. Importantly, both of these metrics exhibited improving trends over the second half of 2013. Another key focus of our organization during 2013 was on disciplined control of our operating expenses. On our fourth quarter earnings call last year, we disclosed our goal of growing operating expenses excluding the Q4 \u201812 restructuring charge at less than 3% annually during 2013 and 2014. We more than met this goal during 2013. The strong control over operating expenses has enabled us to fund greater investments to grow our business and resources to meet our growing compliance demands, and to have increased financial flexibility in the face of a slow growth environment. You will recall that at our financial community meeting in February of last year, we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and overtime earnings targets in a variety of economic environment. Given the slow growth GDP environment we experienced this year, our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance. We were able to drive full year EPS of $4.88, which was 25% higher than last year. Our EPS has now grown at a 13% to compound annual growth rate since 2010 in line with our on average and overtime target to grow earnings per share by 12% to 15%. Over the same multi-year time period, our revenue CAGR has been 6%, well below our on average and overtime target of 8%, we generally feel positive about this performance given the slow growth economic environment.  I would also remind you that back in 2010 there were concerns about the growth potential of our existing card businesses, particularly in an environment with lower levels of consumer spending and borrowing. Since that time, however, our performance has given us greater confidence in the continued growth prospects of our card businesses. Let\u2019s turn now to the more detailed trends starting with billed business on Slide 4. Our billings growth rate remained healthy given the economy and improved slightly on a reported basis from 7% in Q3 to 8% in the current quarter. Billed business overall grew by 9% on an FX adjusted basis, so it\u2019s consistent with the prior quarter.  The USCS segment, which constituted about half of worldwide billed business, saw growth increased from 8% during Q3 to 9% in Q4. Open small business volumes have been a particularly fast growing part of our U.S. business and ended the year having achieved four consecutive quarters of double digit growth.  As many of you know, we will be featuring a discussion on our open business as one of the topics at our upcoming financial community meeting.  We were also pleased to see a modest uptick in growth rate in our GCS segment from 7% to 8% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to see particularly strong volumes in GNS, which grew by 16% year over year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS volume growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region, powered by strong growth in China and Japan. Looking at billed business by geographic region on Slide 5. Consistent with our focus on expanding our business globally, total international volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company and were up 11% year over year on an FX adjusted basis.  Billed business growth within the U.S. region also improved from 8% to 9% during the current quarter. EMEA continues to be our slowest growth region given the lower rates of economic growth within Europe.  Moving on to loans, the other key revenue driver. We continue to see steady growth in loan balances as shown on Slide 6. Worldwide loans grew by 3% versus the prior year, up from 2% last quarter. Our growth rate in the U.S. was 4% which is up slightly from Q3 and continues to outpace the industry average.  Putting it all together down in the revenue slide, you see on Slide 7 that overall revenue growth was 5% on a reported basis and on an FX adjusted basis was 6%. Consistent with our spend-metric model, this revenue growth was primarily driven by higher discount revenue from increased spending volumes.  Secondarily, revenue growth was aided by net interest income increasing 11% versus the prior year as we experienced lower funding cost year over year along with the increase in average loan balances. The sale of our publishing business depressed the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth by approximately 1% during the fourth quarter. For this quarter, this impact on total revenue was largely offset by the greater amount of card member reimbursements recorded in the prior year. Going forward, the loss of publishing revenue in and of itself will depress total revenue growth by a similar percentage point or a little less over each of the next three quarters.  You see on Slide 7 that the two biggest components of our revenues -- discount revenue and net interest income as well as total revenues were all stronger in the fourth quarter than in the full year, reflecting the modest sequential strengthening we saw in the economy and our business.  Turning now to provision where overall our credit metrics remained at all time low levels. Looking at the metrics highlighted on Slide 8, you can see that worldwide lending write-off rates, which were already at historically low levels, declined further during the fourth quarter and remained best in class. The delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter.  Now as a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics when we make investments. Therefore at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase from today\u2019s historically low levels.  Slide 9 shows that our lending reserve coverage levels also remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter after considering the normal seasonal increase in loan balances. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. Finally, as you can see on slide 10, for the full year, provision increased by 6% as the benefits from reserve releases were smaller during 2013 than they were in 2012. While write-off rates have continued to improve and are at historic lows, the rate of improvement in 2013 was slower than what we experienced during the prior year. In the fourth quarter, provision was lower by 17% this year, which is somewhat out of pattern with the full year results as we benefited from a modest reserve release in this year\u2019s Q4 which is a modest reserve build than in a prior year Q4. Turning now from the revenue side to the expense side on slide 11, story gets a bit more complex because of the three items we recorded in Q4 2012 and the merchant settlement this quarter. As of this, I will walk you through each individual line item in subsequent slides. I would make the overall comment that a key to our 2013 results was maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly within operating expenses. This allowed us to achieve solid financial results, while continuing to invest for both our current and future customers. One item I would like to talk about while still on slide 11 is the tax rate. You see that our tax rate during the quarter was 34%, a bit higher than we\u2019ve been trending and expecting. As we closed the year, the final geographic mix of where we generate income came in a little less favorable than we\u2019ve been expecting and drove the higher rate for the quarter. This brought the full year effective tax rate to 32.1%. Let me now start the more detailed expense discussion with operating expense since controlling operating expenses to make our business more efficient has been key to providing additional resources for growth initiatives, and by any measure our teams did a great job this year of more than meeting our ambitious operating expense goals. Slide 12 shows you some of the details of our operating expenses during both the quarter and the full year. And clearly a number of individual lines here were impacted by specific items both this year and last. So, I won\u2019t take the time to go in all of those details but I do want to call out two items. First, other net expense in the quarter includes approximately $66 million of expenses related to the merchant settlement I discussed earlier in which we announced on December 19th. As part of the settlement, we agreed to pay a reasonable attorney fees up to a maximum total of $75 million plus up to $4 million to notify merchants of the settlement terms. A small portion of these costs were accrued for in prior periods, resulting in a net impact of $66 million in the fourth quarter. Second, I would note that sale of our publishing business depressed operating expense growth by little more than 1% in the quarter. So putting it all together on slide 13, you see that excluding the Q4 \u201812 restructuring charge, full year 2013 adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year and remained well below our commitment to grow operating costs at less than 3% annually during 2013. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving our goal of having operating expenses grow by less than 3% again during 2014. So moving to rewards expense, a key source of value for our card members. After excluding the cost of the enhancements to the URR or ultimate redemption rate estimation process for U.S. card members in the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted rewards expense were like 13% during the quarter as illustrated on slide 14. This 13% growth rate in adjusted rewards expense is somewhat higher than the volume growth in our MR and co-brand products due predominantly to two items, a benefit in the prior year due to a decline in the weighted average cost per point and an increase in current year quarter due to an enhancement in the URR estimate process in our largest countries outside the U.S. With this enhancement, the global URR will remain at 94%. As a reminder, loyalty and reward programs are one of our major competitive advantages. Based on their success, we have expanded them during the last few years to offer broader opportunities for cardmembers to earn and redeem points.  Turning then to Slide 14 in our marketing and promotion line where significant amount of our investments in growth are. You see expenses up 12% in Q4 as we took advantage of opportunities to invest in the business while still delivering solid EPS growth.  We were pleased to be able to invest more in this area as the economy and the business strengthened as the year progressed. We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace, including those for new customer acquisitions.  During the fourth quarter we were particularly pleased to support the Fourth Annual Small Business Saturday. Momentum for this event continues to grow led by local businesses around the world. During the current year we supported Small Business Saturday in six countries, including the launch of the event in Australia, Israel and South Africa.  Importantly this event helps us build relationships with all businesses across both our merchant network and our cardmember base. This is critical to both the continued strength we see with small business cardmembers and our continual efforts to expand small business merchant coverage. So more broadly, we believe that we continue to have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our card businesses and from newer initiative. These opportunities exist across our existing card business -- these opportunities, excuse me, across our existing card businesses include increasing our penetration of B2B, middle market and small business spending continuing to deepen our relationships amongst affluent customers, continuing to expand our reach to a broader segment of consumers and expanding our merchant network particularly among smaller merchants.  While all of these areas represent sizable opportunities within the U.S. market, we believe that the long-term potential of these opportunities is even greater internationally where our relative share position today is still significantly lower than it is in the U.S.  As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we also target a portion of our investments for longer-term opportunities, including many initiatives in the digital space. Over the past several years we have increasingly focused our efforts on two large initiatives: reloadable prepaid, our products that help you move and manage your money as well as our Loyalty Partner rewards coalition program. Both of these efforts continue to ramp up, and we believe that they provide significant opportunities for growth. This growth, however, will occur over a longer period.  Last, a common theme across all of these new initiatives is that they improve our ability to reach new customer segments and help make our brand more inclusive.  So given the breadth and depth of opportunities that we have which are financially sound, one of the challenges we have is how to balance our investments with our performance against our on average and over time financial targets. As I mentioned earlier, you did see us increase our investment spending in the latter half of 2013 as the economy and our business improved. Historically this approach has led to fluctuations in our investment levels over time. For example, during 2010 and 2011 our operating and marketing expenses increased as a result of our strategy to re-invest a portion of the Visa MasterCard settlement gains and the benefits from improving credit performance back into growing the business. We are completing our planning process for 2014 currently and well as always, be thoughtful and prioritized which investments we will fund. Of relevance here are our plans to create a joint-venture to accelerate the transformation of our global business travel division.  As an update, the negotiations for the joint venture continue to advance as we had planned. Our best estimate for closing date remains the second quarter 2014. Upon closing, it is expected that our partners will infuse a $700 million to $1 billion capital contribution into the new joint venture. American Express would contribute the assets of our business - travel business. As a result, we would expect to realize a meaningful P&L gain upon the close of the transaction. This could offer us some additional financial flexibility during 2014. So turning now to capital, our strong capital position and the sizeable amount of new capital we generate through net income each quarter provide significant flexibility. This allows us to balance the capital needs in our businesses, our desire to remain strong capital ratios and the potential for significant capital returns to our shareholders. The benefits of our strong capital position were on display all year as we returned 81% capital generated in the year to shareholders. We did this while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratio year-over-year as you can see on slide 16. As usual, you do our capital ratios decline slightly sequentially during the fourth quarter due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2014 CCAR process earlier this month and we will expect to hear back from the Fed about our submission in March. Like the rest of the industry, we have worked hard to continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes which supports this critical effort. While it is too early to know how this process will play out for 2014, I will say personally that going through this planning process for the first time has furthered my own confidence and the strength of our business model and capital structure. Part of the strength has been our continuing efforts to evolve the mix of our funding sources which you can see on slide 17. We have worked hard to improve the diversity of our funding sources by driving a significant increase in the contribution from deposits over the last several years. At this point, we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward. Overall, our liquidity position remained strong and we continue to hold enough cash to cover our next 12 months of funding maturities. Turning to other events of the last quarter, let me first make just a few more general comments on the two settlement announcements we made the financial aspects of which I have already touched on. During the quarter, we announced that we agreed to settle two antitrust class actions filed by U.S. merchants that challenged specific provisions in the company\u2019s card acceptance agreements. The settlement agreement if approved will address certain merchant concerns while helping to ensure that American Express card members are treated fairly at point of sale. We also expected to limit the company\u2019s exposure to future legal claims and ensure that any credit and charge, surcharge on American Express card transactions would be no more than the surcharge charge on competing credit for charge card products. The settlement is presently under-review by the court. Some of the merchants that have cases pending against the company have objected to the settlement. Any objections or concerns will be considered by the court as it determines whether to approve the settlement. During the quarter, we\u2019ve also announced that we had reached settlements to resolve previously disclosed reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several discontinued products that were previously offered to card members. Marketing of the products included in these settlement was discontinued more than a year ago. Most of the card member reimbursements have already taken place and most of the cost associated with those reimbursements, as well as the fines were provided for in prior periods. The regulatory environment has evolved significantly and has heightened the focus that all the financial companies must have on their controls and processes. We take our regulatory obligations very seriously. As we have discussed, we continue to scrutinize and improve our card practices, regulators wants companies to be clear, transparent and fair to their customers, a goal that is very consistent with our own objective. As previously reported, American Express continues to conduct internal reviews designed to identify issues correct them and ensure that our products and practices need a high standard of quality. Before I conclude, I wanted to touch on one other item that has been getting a lot of attention. The recent data breach at Target. We continue to work closely with Target and law reinforcement on the investigations and we are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves. We have sophisticated monitoring systems and internal safeguards in place to protect cardmember accounts and to detect fraudulent activities. We have the appropriate broad controls in place on affected accounts and are continuing to take targeted actions as needed. We have seen minimal exposure thus far.  The closed loop is a big advantage for us, especially in situations like this. Our relationships with cardmembers and merchants represent one of the reasons why our fraud rates are the lowest in the industry.  So in summary, coming back to our financial results, we feel very good about our overall performance in the current economic environment. During the quarter we saw healthy billings growth and modest growth in loan balances which drove FX adjusted revenue growth of 6%. This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics, disciplined control of operating expenses, and a strong capital position allowed us to generate a healthy growth in EPS while still investing in the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace. Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) First, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries - Barclays: So with the stock having traded up a fair amount recently and also revenue growth still kind of below target, does this increase your interest in all and using excess capital to do acquisitions versus buying back stock here?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think when you look at the company\u2019s history, we have selectively used acquisitions over the years when we see an opportunity to either enhance our capabilities or build upon an existing strength of the company in an area. And certainly as we think about our long-term strategies, we are always looking for opportunities to do that.  All that said, when you think about our policies on using our capital while on average and over time we\u2019ve said we will return about 50% of our capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and use the other 50% for other growth initiatives or acquisitions. Acquisitions are the kinds of things that you can\u2019t really predict and you really need to be very thoughtful about when you find the right opportunity. And when we don\u2019t have those opportunities, we\u2019re very committed to returning capital to shareholder and that\u2019s what you saw us do in 2013.  And so when you think about the future it\u2019s very hard to predict and I think our commitment is to be thoughtful about anything we do on the acquisition side and be very consistent in returning capital to shareholders when they\u2019re are not opportunities that we think are great opportunities on the acquisition side.\nMark DeVries - Barclays: And then just to follow up, I was hoping I can get you to quantify what you meant by meaningful P&L gain from the closing of the JV and comment on whether you included that in your capital plan submission?\nJeff Campbell: So two separate questions. So the size of the gain -- I will tell you, beyond saying it will be a material gain, there are still so many moving pieces as we work through the last part of this, that I am probably not comfortable giving you a number. I would point out that if you think about the math it\u2019s pretty simple. If the partner puts in $700 million to $1 billion, we\u2019ve got 50% ownership and re-contribute our assets, that will define the value, if you will, of what the joint venture will be worth and then what gain will drop out will be a function of what is on our books as we contribute the business travel enterprise to the joint venture.  So it will be a material gain. I can\u2019t really give you a range today. As we thought about our CCAR submission what I would say to you is that what we convinced ourselves though and made the point of to the Fed in the submission is that in any circumstance, even though there is still a range of outcomes here, we would see that the transaction will be accretive or positive to our capital ratios. And so while we can\u2019t quantify, it\u2019s all upside and then we built our CCAR submission on an assumption that it would be neutral to positive. But we didn\u2019t -- the way these things work, we want to build a share repurchase plan based on the certainty that it would happen.\nMark DeVries - Barclays: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we will go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Yeah. Following-up on that last comment, I guess when we think about your CCAR submission, are you anticipating, just keep a -- targeting a flat capital ratio and basically paying out consistent with what you did in 2013? And then could you have built in a contingency that upon the sale if that were to happen, you would use that excess capital towards capital management activities? And then I guess, secondly, just on the tax rate, could you just tell us how we should think about the level going forward? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: So on CCAR, I would say, we certainly did not build in a contingency. I don\u2019t think that really fits with the way the CCAR process have evolved to thus far as run by the fed. More broadly, when we think about our CCAR submission, we clearly do a tremendous amount of work internally and have a tremendous amount of discussion and debate amongst the management team and with our Board of Directors. And it is really all aims are trying to balance the views of our regulators, the views of our shareholders and our own views about the strength of our capital structure and our future performance. I think that leads you to what we submitted and I don\u2019t want to get into the details of what we submitted. But I think our history would show that we are pretty committed to consistently being shareholder friendly. We believe that our capital structure is strong and within that set of thoughts, we submitted what we thought was a very balanced submission and we\u2019ll see how it goes. On the tax rate, geographic mix does vary a little bit. If you look over the last few years, our tax rate has consistently been in the low 30s, but it\u2019s varied a little bit between about 30% to 32% on a full annual basis. And we don\u2019t necessarily see anything that we learned this year that suggest we will be outside that historical range. Beyond that, probably is a little hard to predict exactly what will happen in terms of the mix and other items next year.\nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKen Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Good evening. Thank you. Could you spend a little time and may be discuss some of the seasonal factors that impact the discount rate. You\u2019ve had several fourth quarters where you have a significant reduction in discount rate. It tends to snap back in the first quarter. Can you just remind us what those seasonal factors are if you can quantify them that would be helpful as well?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. It is probably tough to specifically quantify, but the basic trend is pretty simple. If you think about the fourth quarter, you have a little spurred upwards in retail spend and a little decline in some of the more business-oriented spend. And that mix shift is quite consistent each year and drives the discount rate down very, very modestly and that\u2019s why you see it pop back up in Q1.\nKen Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And are there are any other just either pricing or deal related factors that are more first quarter seasonal or fourth quarter seasonal that impact then?\nJeff Campbell: No. No, it\u2019s really just that simple mix shift..\nKen Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And maybe just lastly, you had mentioned that you\u2019re going to balance out essentially the gain that may be taken from the sale of the Business Travel. I just want to make sure I understand this right. So basically, you\u2019re going to look to keep your investments at an elevated level in terms of just driving future growth. But you\u2019re possibly going to have some of that fall of the bottom line, is that the way to think about the balancing act that you have got to look out there?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I want to be a little careful because this is a potential joint venture. I think the point I was trying to make in my prepared remarks is we have a long track record of being very thoughtful about how we balance our on average and over time financial targets, with steadily investing in the many growth opportunities that we see. And it is certainly possible that as we get into 2014 and as we execute on the business travel joint venture, you may see an elevated level of investments depending on how all the final economics work out. And we will be as we always are thoughtful about making those investments in things that are going to produce very good returns for our shareholders, and we will be very transparent about what we are doing and why.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: A couple of questions. First, the Target breach. Do you think this is a potential accelerator to EMV adoption, and could you see regulatory involvement pushing that along?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think it\u2019s early for anyone to know exactly what all of the impacts of the Target breach will be. Although there is obviously already a line of regulators and other oversight authorities who have expressed interest and understanding what\u2019s going on. I think from our perspective, we have a tremendous dedication to the security of everything that goes on between our merchants and our cardmembers. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry. Our closed loop gives us some real advantages here in helping to manage things.  And there are many things we can do with our merchant partners frankly that help lower fraud rates. Moving towards new technologies like EMV is one of those things. But frankly, there are many others and they all have different costs and difference trade-offs. Certainly, it has long been our goal to work ever more closely with our merchant partners to lower rates of fraud. We think that this may spur greater interest in doing that. The exact form it takes, I think, is probably anyone\u2019s guess at this point.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Secondly, thinking about the cardmember services expense line, it\u2019s been in the press that the American Airlines lounge relationship has left American Express. I was wondering if we\u2019re going to see any type of either adjustment lower for that, the end of that relationship or a ratchet-up in spending to account for replacing that service whether that\u2019s through Centurion Lounge construction or other things?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think we probably start by thinking about this from the customer or cardmembers\u2019 perspective. And we have a long track record of doing lots of things that make all of our products valuable propositions for the customer. In the specific case of the Platinum Card, that is a card really targeted to people who travel a lot. There is a wide range of benefits that people get from the Platinum Card, including I would point out, even post once the American Airlines announcement goes into effect, which I believe is March, we will have access to three different sets of lounges - Delta as well as two others, Priority Pass and Airspace.  We have a variety of credits that we offer to customers on cost of global entry and other airline fees. You are correct that we are experimenting with building our own lounges and they\u2019ve met quite a rousing reception thus far, in the two that we\u2019ve opened in Las Vegas and Dallas. And we\u2019ve announced plans already to open a couple others at LaGuardia in New York and in San Francisco. So, we see and we also feel that we remain very competitive, because if you think about it with the consolidation in the airline industry, and I would remind you as someone who was the CFO of American Airlines 12 years ago, there were a lot more airlines when I was the CFO there.  As the airlines have consolidated, you\u2019re really left today with sort of no card is going to give you access to any broader set of lounges than what our Platinum Card does, and that\u2019s sort of what airline consolidation has done. So we feel very good about the customer proposition and we think we have a long track record of being innovative about how we continually evolve that proposition. So it is a great value to customers and that is, that will drive all of, I think ultimately, yes, that will fall into our P&L and have an impact on the cardmember services line. But I think, frankly, the best way to think about that is, I would not expect this to have any material impact one way or the other as we continually find ways to provide value to our customers.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go through line of James Friedman with SIG.\nJames Friedman - SIG: Hi. Thanks. I want to ask about an update on the Wells and U.S. Bank partnership. Jeff, how should we think about sizing that say in the year ahead in terms of cards-in-force?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so we are very excited about both the Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank relationships, and we see it as a really great commentary and the many things we can bring to our partners in this kinds of relationships. Now it is a long and complex thing for large institutions to launch new products. The first thing, I do want to point out as well. Wells has begun to launch a few small test markets. These deals will actually take several years to fully rollout and reach some level of maturity. We\u2019re clearly very excited about the longer term potential of both of these partnerships and we think for both of those institutions we can really help them achieve any of the business goals they have and further their penetration particularly amongst their own customer basis and help them grow their card businesses to be more commensurate, frankly, with the broader size of those two institutions. But this will play out over a longer time period and so, I probably don\u2019t want to size it beyond those general comments.\nJames Friedman - SIG: Okay. And then, if I could a follow-up on, with regard to Serve and Bluebird, if you could talk in general terms about what we should expect with the revenue mix between fee and transaction revenue overtime, how does the company think about the revenue generation from those products?\nJeff Campbell: Well, clearly, on the prepaid products you have both a range of fee revenue. Although, I would point out to you that we have worked very hard going back to some ways my comments about the Platinum Card. We have worked very hard to start with the customer proposition and I think you would find that we have two of the lowest fee products in the market with the widest range of functionality and features for the consumer and that\u2019s exactly where we want to be on the continuum here. When you think about the economics, you have a range of both revenues from fees, as well as, of course the point-of-sale or discount revenue. And you also have to think about it in the broader context of the family of products in the many different customer segments that American Express targets reaches. So we look at all those things as we look at the economic model for Serve and for Bluebird and we are still in early stages, I would point out to you, we just re-launched the Serve product for example a few months ago. But we\u2019re encouraged by the early signs and we think this is a market that over the years will grow to be a very significant market.\nJames Friedman - SIG: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next we will go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities: Thank you. For my first question I was hoping to revisit the points that were raised regarding the closing of the JV. So just to put balance around the potential magnitude of gain, if hypothetically there was a zero book value to the assets on AmEx\u2019s book spend, since this is a 50-50 JV and the partners contribution is valued at somewhere between $700 million to $1 billion, and presumably AmEx\u2019s contribution would be valued at the same level. So at zero book value then the maximum theoretical gain would be between $700 million to $1 billion? And then, I guess, if we looked at that in terms of let\u2019s say the book value was not zero, but if the book value was $500 million, then would that suggest the maximum gain is $200 million to $500 million, am I thinking about that the right way?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. You\u2019re thinking about it exactly the right way. The two things I\u2019d remind you about are, these kinds of quite complex transactions do not come without a tremendous amount of effort and cost by both internal and external resources. And then, I\u2019d also remind you that our Business Travel business is a highly global business, which produces a very complex structure and will produce a very complex tax outcome, which is part of what we are still working through. But with those two editions, yes, it really is as simple as what you just took us through.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities: Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up question, if I may, it has two parts, the first part on revenues, the second part on expenses. So on the revenue part, I was hoping that you could touch on the 4.5 times multiplier effect that AmEx has historically enjoyed relative to GDP and billings growth, relative to that relationship, is that something you still believe in? In other words, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any reason to believe that that\u2019s 4.5 times multiplier effect will continue to hold? And then finally on the expense portion of that, it was good to hear you guys reaffirmed your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3%, I guess, separate from that, I was wondering your expense ratio I believe was at 70% this quarter, should we still expect that ratio to continue to work its way down towards the more normal 2007 levels that you guys have talked about of 67%?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. So, on the 4.5, the interesting thing is if you look actually at the data we have this year, we don\u2019t have GDP data, of course, for Q4. The 4.5 historical relationships still seems like a pretty good metric when you look at the most recent quarters and just to make sure everyone on the call is clear that\u2019s applying that 4.5 ratio to year-over-year real GDP. I had to train myself a little bit since I joined American Express six months ago, much of the media talks about sequential rates of GDP growth, but what we\u2019re talking is the year-over-year number. And I would say, we\u2019re not saying -- we are not necessarily actually trying to make any commentary on correlation but we are saying when you just look at the math that historical relationship has existed. To go to the operating expense ratio, you\u2019re right, I think it\u2019s for the full year of 2013, we ended at 70%, I believe we were at 71% last year, if you exclude the restructuring and other charges. The point I would make is we are very committed to the operating expense goals that we have laid out very publicly for over a year now and that is keeping our operating expense growth in 2014 to less than 3% as we did in 2013. Beyond that, I would say we want to be a little cautious about driving to other expense ratios because what we are always trying to do is meet our bottom line on average over time targets, particularly around EPS, while still being really thoughtful about how we can most productively and with the highest returns invest in growth opportunities for our shareholders.  And those growth opportunities come in different forms. Sometimes it takes just traditional advertising and promotional spend, other times it means hiring sales people who runs our operation expense. And you get different impacts depending on which ratio you want to manage. And so, and I would say our real commitment is to working towards continuing to meet our on-average and over time bottom line targets and for 2014 meeting that operating expense target.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill.\nChris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Thanks for taking my call or my question. I wanted to just explore one other point on the JV, and I respect the complexity here. But trying to understand the cost basis, is it safe to think about this as parts of the cost basis have really been in place for decades, and so it would come in a pretty low book value, but other parts like newer technology are much more modern? Is that sort of wide parameters for thinking about it?\nJeff Campbell: I\u2019ll tell you the complexity of this is great, because you are correct. There are some parts of this business that are quite old. I would also tell you they\u2019re very, very intertwined. We have, for most of our long history in the travel business, run it in a pretty integrated fashion with other parts of our company that we\u2019ll retain. I\u2019d remind you that over the years we have done a number of acquisitions, which adds complexity. It is a highly global business. So, maybe this goes a little bit to the point I made in response to the earlier question about, there are deal costs, there are transaction costs. And part of them go to just sorting through how do we really cleanly create a separate entity and how do we make sure that we understand all of the financial and legal and tax implications.  And I\u2019ll stop there because I don\u2019t want to sound overly apologetic. But for all of those reasons it\u2019s just difficult to give you a better estimate at this point.\nChris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Understood. Just to kind of appreciate what all is involved here. And then to shift gears on to the settlement announced on December 19, I was a little surprised that the word \u201csurcharge\u201d appeared as frequently as it did in the summary of the terms and is the right way to look at this as sort of an abundance of legal caution for an outcome in the United States that has more [surcharging or is this] saying that we are going to be in a world where surcharging is more common? I am just trying to put this in the right context.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I certainly would quickly say we do not expect the outcome you had at the end of your statement there. So, let me step back for a minute. So I\u2019ll make a few points. And I might almost start with, look we are out there every single day working to build relationships with our merchant partners. And we are really all about helping them grow their businesses, we\u2019re not about being in litigation with them.  And so part of what we are trying to do here is find a way to put this litigation behind us and begin to work more productively with all of our merchant partners. What we get out of the agreement is a clear commitment that our card members will be treated fairly relative to other credit and charge card customers of any other institution. That is very important to us. We think there is tremendous value there.  We also believe and we are long on public record about this that surcharging is a very consumer and customer unfriendly practice. I\u2019d remind you that surcharging is outlawed in a number of states in the U.S. And I\u2019d also remind you that there are many countries all around the globe of course where we do business, which have all many different regulatory regimes. And In those where surcharging has been allowed, it has not become a rampant practice, we think because merchants recognize that it is just not a customer-friendly practice. So when all is said and done, we thought this settlement was a good think for our shareholders, was a good thing for our merchant partners and allow us to get back to running the business and building relationships.\nChris Donat - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we will go to the line of Don Fandetti with Citi.\nDon Fandetti - Citi: Jeff, you would mentioned in your commentary about China benefiting your G&S business? I was just curious if that\u2019s just normal growth or if you are gaining market share that would seem like that could be a good opportunity to sign up other banks? I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and just confirm that the economics are generally the same from region to region at G&S.\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. Well, I do think it is important to be very clear about what I said about China. So, our China growth in billings has been tremendous and has been a significant, though not the only part of why you see particularly high growth rates when we breakout billed business for you either by segment, it\u2019s in the GNS segment or by region where you see it in the JAPA region, and we\u2019re very pleased by that billings growth. But I would remind you that in China as you would really see for all foreign payments players, today we earn very little revenue on the domestic spend within China and then we do much better on what we would call the outbound spend and that\u2019s just due to the regulatory environment in China. So longer term, we think it\u2019s really important that we establish as larger presence as we can in China and we have a number of different business things that we\u2019re doing in China. One of which is reflected in the great growth in billed business that you see, I just want to be a little cautious in saying that that billed business does not today generate particularly material amounts of revenue or earnings.\nDon Fandetti - Citi: I understand that, I was just curious, if on your cross-border out of China, if you feel like there\u2019s room to sign up for other banks to grow that business and are the economics similar to what you\u2019d see in another region even though knowing it\u2019s a small contribution to revenue?\nJeff Campbell: Well, we are continually exploring different opportunities in China. I certainly don\u2019t want to get into exactly who we are talking to and what our strategies are in China. Let me just say that we see it as a very exciting long-term market. We think our brand carries into China very well. I think the billing growth that you are seeing demonstrates that and we think that it is creating a number of interesting opportunities for us, but I really don\u2019t want to comment beyond that.\nDon Fandetti - Citi: Okay. Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: We probably have time for about one more question, operator.\nOperator: Okay. And that will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli - William Blair: Thank you and good afternoon. The spending growth accelerated nicely in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. It had a small acceleration, but important and I was wondering if you could give a little more color on that if the online spending growth, which I think is about 20% of your spend if that there was an outsized acceleration in online spend. And then just related to that, I mean, you seem to think that the economy was helpful, how does -- what is American Express\u2019s view on how the economy going into 2014?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so let me -- maybe answer those in reverse. Certainly in terms of the economy, we don\u2019t profess to have any greater insights, our business is not necessary a leading indicator. So, I would tell you, we build our internal plans around a consensus economists forecast of what GDP in the U.S. and many other markets around the globe is going to be. And I think we are pretty transparent about our sensitivity to what economic growth actually ends up to be, and so we hope that it turns out to be frankly as strong as sum of the consensus economists are saying. When you look at Q4, certainly like all payment forms, we see tremendously high growth rates in online spend. We\u2019re not going to provide today any specific numbers about Q4, I would just make the obvious point that like other players, the growth rates in online spend are quite high. It still remains a more modest piece of the total.  I think the most important thing though for us as we think about trends and what we saw over the course of 2013 does come back to the point I made earlier that we are pleased by the fact that when you look at the back half of the year, you saw an acceleration across billings and across revenues versus what you saw in the first half. So, we think that\u2019s a good trend as we head into 2014, whatever the economic environment may be. \nBob Napoli - William Blair: Great. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Great. So I\u2019d like to thank you all for your time and Operator, I think we\u2019re done. Thanks for your interest in American Express.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead sir. \nRick Petrino: Thank you. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s 2012 10-K already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2013 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn it over to Jeff. \nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I am excited to be here on my first quarterly earnings call with American Express since joining the company on July 15 and listening as Dan Henry managed the Q2 earnings call later that week. I am also excited to have my first earnings call be one where we have such solid results to discuss. Our performance during the quarter produced strong EPS growth built upon improved billed business and revenue growth trends, a continuation of excellent credit performance and disciplined control over operating expenses. During the quarter we also made a number of strategic announcements which I\u2019ll discuss later on the call. To begin with the summary you can see on slide 2, FX adjusted growth in billed business of 9% is the primary driver of our FX adjusted revenue growth rate of 7%. This FX adjusted revenue growth rate is the highest we have seen this year and helped us grow net income by 9%. Our strong capital position allowed us to continue our share repurchase efforts which cumulatively resulted in our average shares outstanding declining by 5% versus the prior year. The combination of our solid operating performance and strong capital position drove our earnings per share to a $1.25 which was up 15% versus the prior year. These results helped to bring our ROE for the period ending September 30 to 24%. As a reminder ROE is calculated on a rolling full year basis. So this quarter will be the last one to include the impact of the three previously announced items we experienced in Q4, 2012. Excluding these items the adjusted ROE for Q3, \u201913 is 27%. We feel good about this improved performance especially considering the continued moderate pace of the economic recovery. Now focusing first on our billed business, loan and revenue performance. You can see on slide 3 that billed business growth remained healthy across all of our segments as it increased sequentially from 8% to 9% overall on an FX adjusted basis we continue to see particularly strong performance in GNS which grew by 16% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS volume growth in Asia including China and Japan remained particularly strong. Also worth noting was that corporate card billings growth improved to 7% on an FX adjusted basis from 5% in Q2 as we lapped the slowdown in corporate spending that we saw beginning with the second half of 2012. Looking at billed business growth by geographical region on slide 4, you see the growth rates accelerated slightly across all regions sequentially versus the second quarter. Of particular note here is that EMEA FX adjusted growth improved to 8% during Q3 which is the highest growth we have seen in that region since 2011.  Turning to loans we continue to see modest growth in loan balances as shown on slide 5. Worldwide loans grew by 2% versus the prior year. Our growth rate in loans in the U.S. was 3% which continues to outpace the industry average. Now I would remind you that our loan growth is really an outcome of our continued focus on and growth in our spend-centric customer base and it's not necessarily an objective in itself. Putting it all together on the revenue side you see on slide 6 that overall revenue growth was 6% on a reported basis and on an FX adjusted basis accelerated from 4% in Q2 to 7% in Q3. Consistent with our spend-centric model this revenue growth was driven primarily by higher discount revenue from increased spending volumes. Secondarily, revenue growth was aided by net interest income increasing by 9% versus the prior year as we experienced lower funding costs along with the increase in average loan balances. Probably also worth calling out that the 5% increase in travel commissions in fees growth looks like a significant uptick from Q2 where we saw a 5% decline. Both of these year-over-year changes however where impacted by the timing around the re-signing of certain supplier contracts. Turning to the provision, overall our credit performance remains excellent and helped provide us the financial resources we need to continue to grow the business. Looking at the metrics highlighted on slide 7, you see that worldwide lending write-off rates which were already at historically low levels declined further during the third quarter and also remained best-in-class. Our strategy to focus our lending acquisition efforts on premium lending products continues to help attract lower risk card members into our franchise. While we would expect that lending write-off rates will eventually increase from today\u2019s historically low levels, we will also see on Slide 7 that we have not yet seen any signs of credit deterioration overall as total delinquency rates remained consistent with the prior quarter. Slide 8 shows that our lending reserve coverage levels also remained relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. Finally, as you can see on Slide 9, despite the improvement in write-off rates, our provision was slightly higher than prior year as decreased write-offs in the current year were more than offset by higher volumes and a lower level of reserve releases. Turning now from the revenue side to the expense side, as you can see on Slide 10, total expenses grew by 5% versus the prior year. As you would expect, growth rates differed across the various expense lines as we prioritized our spending across the business. At a high level, you see a few things in these lines. The year-over-year growth in rewards expense was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the quarter, while card member services was relatively flat. We continue to show good control over operating expense, which I will come back to in a minute. All of this is aimed at providing the ability to invest in growth, which primarily though not completely flows through the marketing and promotion line while still seeking to achieve our financial targets. And as I mentioned, we do remain very focused on controlling operating expenses to make our business more efficient and provide additional resources for growth initiatives. Slide 11 shows you some of the detail of our operating expenses for the quarter. Most importantly, from a recurring perspective, salaries and employee benefits expenses were up only 2% versus the prior year demonstrating our strong controls in this area. While total operating expense growth of 4% was higher than what we have seen earlier this year, this was due in part to some choices we made to increase investments in technology as well as some costs we incurred associated with the two transactions we announced during the quarter, the potential Business Travel joint venture and the sale of our Publishing business. So while growth rates can fluctuate in any given quarter, our year-to-date operating expense performance is flat versus the prior year and remains well below our annual target as shown on Slide 12. We remain confident in our ability to have operating expenses grow by less than our 3% target for the full year. It is also important to point out that these results reflected many of the benefits of the reengineering actions we announced earlier this year, which has helped us continue to proactively adapt and strengthen every aspect of our business as well as allowing us to address changes in customer preferences towards online and mobile servicing in particular. In my first month at American Express, I would further say that one of the things that I have been particularly impressed with is the company\u2019s ability to achieve our reengineering and cost targets while not just maintaining, but actually improving the level of service provided to our customers. In addition, we have been able to achieve these results while funding growing investments in our critical control and compliance efforts. As a result of all these improvements, customer service remains a key competitive differentiator for American Express as evidenced by the announcement last month from our winning our seventh consecutive J.D. Power award for achieving the highest customer satisfaction in the U.S. credit card industry. So to come back to the prioritization we do across all our expenses, during the third quarter, we were able to deliver excellent financial results while still funding substantial investment opportunities. As we think about these investment opportunities, we balance our mix of spend between shorter and longer term horizons as well as between traditional versus newer opportunities. As you would expect the largest portion of our investment dollars targets the significant opportunities we see in our existing card businesses. In the U.S. as well as around the world given our focus on international growth for the past several years. These initiatives include card and merchant acquisition, building loyalty with the existing card members and the expansion of our GNS business. Many of these initiatives were the drivers of our marketing and promotion expense growing by 8% versus the prior year which put us at a higher level than we have seen in recent quarters as you can see on slide 13. We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace including those for new customer acquisitions. In particular we believe that there continue to be significant opportunities to grow our volumes around the world by acquiring new charge and premium lending prospects on our products. Our solid control over operating expenses is helping us to fund these efforts. But I also want to remind you that while a significant amount of our investments are still included within the marketing and promotion line overtime an increasing percentage of our key investments are occurring within operating expenses including expansion of our merchant and corporate sales force, technology development and enhancements to our control and compliance activities. It's also worth noting that we continue to invest in and see great progress in expanding our network business around the world. Our new partnership with Wells Fargo which we announced in August clearly illustrates the value that other see in our global network as well as the potential opportunities we have to grow the network business both internationally and in the U.S. As I said earlier we also target a portion of our investments for longer term opportunities including many initiatives in the digital space that we believe are attractive opportunities but that will take longer to pay back. Two of our larger efforts in this area are around reloadable prepaid, our products that help you move and manage your money which we extensively discussed at our recent financial community meeting as well as our loyalty partner rewards coalition program. On the former we were pleased last week to announce the relaunch of the certain product. And on the latter we continue to see the number of customers in our loyalty partner rewards coalition programs growing nicely. Both of these efforts along with our many other digital initiatives we believe provide potential new opportunities for growth over the longer term. So turning now to capital, our strong capital position and the sizeable amount of new capital we generate through net income each quarter provide significant flexibility. This allows us to balance the capital needs in our businesses, our desire to maintain strong capital ratios and the potential for significant capital returns to our shareholders. The benefits of our strong capital position were on display this quarter as we returned 86% capital generated to shareholders while still maintaining the capital ratios you can see on slide 14. We\u2019re of course working hard on the planning for our 2014 CCAR submission and are continuously improving and evolving our process. We remain committed to maintaining our strong capital position while also leveraging that strength to create value for our shareholders, part of our commitment to maintain strong capital position has been working to evolve the mix of our funding sources which you can see on slide 15. We have worked hard to improve the diversity of our funding sources by driving a significant increase and the contribution from deposits. We have seen excellent traction in the growth of our personal savings direct deposit program and deposits now makeup over 40% of our total funding. Overall our liquidity position remained strong and we continue to hold enough cash to cover our next 12 months of funding maturities. Given today\u2019s political climate as I will come back to it at the end. It's probably also worth noting that the majority of our cash is held on deposit with the Fed, and our direct holdings of treasuries constitutes less than 1% of our liquid assets. Turning to other events of the last quarter let me make just a few comments on the two other announcements we made. First, in September, we announced plans to create a joint venture designed to accelerate the transformation of our Global Business Travel division. American Express has a long history in business travel. And we believe this proposed joint venture would create greater investment capacity for the business allowing it to further enhance its suite of products and services, attract new customers and grow internationally to deliver additional value to customers. This should all serve to strengthen the linkages with our corporate card and other businesses. We will plan to update you with more information about the proposed transaction and its financial impact as we progress towards a potential closing date, which we currently estimate will be Q2 2014. On a much smaller scale, we also announced in September the sale of our Publishing business to Time Inc. and this transaction closed in early October. Publishing constitute a relatively small percentage of our revenues and earnings during the past several years. It did however provide a valued benefit to our customers, card members. So while banking regulations will limit our ability to engage in non-financial activities, our operating agreement with Time will help ensure a seamless transition. From a financial perspective, the Publishing business will no longer be reflective in our financial statements beginning in Q4. Before I conclude, I feel it\u2019s only prudent to add a few comments regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling as we all watch by the hour what is happening in DC. We have not yet seen any direct impact on our business here at American Express, but we are not immune from the broader economies in which we operate, no one is. Now, as we started this call, it looks like our leaders in DC are finally coming to an agreement in both the Senate and the House. Resolving the stalemate is critically important. The alternative is now come that would erode consumer confidence and jeopardize a still uncertain economic recovery. So in summary, coming back to our results, we feel very good about our overall performance in the current economic environment. During the quarter, we saw modest improvements in billings growth across all regions. We also saw improved revenue growth, which then combined with best-in-class credit metrics, discipline on controlling operating expenses and a strong capital position to generate healthy earnings growth. Our financial strength allowed us to achieve this growth while still investing in the growth opportunities we currently see in the marketplace. Looking forward, we continued to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. \nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Thank you. Good evening. I had a quick question on billed business volumes. When we look at the acceleration even on FX adjusted basis it\u2019s fairly modest year-over-year. Could you just talk about how you guys feel about that and what might be some of the constraining factors that are leading to some temporary growth year-over-year? And then secondly just on prepaid, I know you guys talked a lot about it this quarter, I was just wondering if you could just discuss its contribution to profitability and how you guys think about its contribution maybe over time? Thank you. \nJeff Campbell: Great. Well, I would say given the continued moderate pace of economic recovery both in the U.S. and the other \u2013 most of the other significant economies we serve around the globe, we actually feel pretty good about the sequential acceleration we saw from 8% to 9% in FX adjusted billing growth. And I think we would really not necessarily expect to see dramatic uptick until we saw something different happening in the economy that also brings it back I think to the importance of nothing happening in DC tonight or tomorrow that further disrupts the pace of economic recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere. On the prepaid point we did spend quite a bit of time at the August financial community meeting having Dan talk about our enterprise growth efforts and in particular about our efforts in the reloadable prepaid market. You also heard me in my comments talk a little bit about how we tried to as we think about where we are investing we like to create a mix of investments some of which are targeted at producing short-term results to help us achieve our financial targets next year and some of which have much longer term time horizons, and certainly we would put what we\u2019re trying to achieve in the reloadable prepaid market in the latter category. We\u2019re very excited about that market and we see a very significant market potential in the longer term as I think Dan did a very nice job of taking people through in August and also Jim has showed you a number of metrics at that meeting that we think are very early, very positive indicators about the potential that we see in the market longer-term but it is a longer-term prospect and certainly in the near term the revenue and earnings contributions from the prepaid market will be fairly modest but we think it's really important part of the broader investment portfolio and we think it's really important part of what a company of our size and scale that manages itself for the long term needs to do and that is having a mixture of both initiatives targeted at short-term growth as well as those targeted at the long-term. \nOperator: Thank you, and next we will go to the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead. \nDon Fandetti - Citigroup: Jeff I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about historically I think one of the concerns that AMEX has been when the top line starts to accelerate that there is a propensity to boost expenses and I was just curious you know you think there is a strong commitment still to keeping expenses under control as we look like we\u2019re turning the corner on top line growth? \nJeff Campbell: Well I think that's a very good question Don and as I said in my comments one of the things I have been most impressed by in my first three months here is the commitment of the company and the extent of the reengineering efforts going on across this entire company, all aimed at hitting the expense targets that we set for this year and for next and in fact we have done much better than we set out to do in 2013, we\u2019re flat year-to-date and we\u2019re certainly very confident that we will come in for the full year below our target of 3% operating expense growth. When we launched those initiatives we did talk about 2014 as well and it's certainly too early to give you a forecast for 2014 but what I would tell you is that many of the initiatives, many of the things that we\u2019re doing in the reengineering area are only in midflight and there are many aspects of the program that we\u2019ll still continue to play out next year. And so I certainly feel very comfortable saying it's an appropriate target for us in 2014 to continue to see the kind of great control on operating expenses that you see in 2013. Now I would say as you go beyond 2014 we\u2019re very committed to our financial targets and we've have had the same long-term financial targets since 1993 but we're also very committed to managing the company for the long term and to using our financial strength to continually invest in growth opportunities both in our traditional businesses and some of the things that we think are a little longer-term as Sanjay just asked about in the prior question. So some of those investments at times are going to drive operating expense in the longer-term, so as the near-term benefits of the reengineering start to become more distant as we move beyond 2014, I think we will be thoughtful about how we manage expenses across the company but our larger goal will be to continue to achieve the kind of growth we have over a much longer time period historically that is consistent with our long-term financial targets. \nOperator: We will go next to the line of Craig Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding marketing, 9% of total revenue, was that still \u2013 is that still an appropriate target for the year? And to follow up on other revenue excluding ICBC gains which I believe were in the numbers last year that line was up nearly 10%. Is the growth there being driven by loyalty partner above everything else? Thanks. \nJeff Campbell: Well, let me take those one at a time. On the marketing, I think as I have on the history Craig, at one point we said if you take a historical average view, our marketing and promotional expenses have on average been about 9% of revenue through different parts of the cycle. Certainly if you just even look at the slide that\u2019s in the deck today, you see that there is quite a bit of quarterly volatility to that number. And I think the more important way to think about the target is we are very committed to achieving the financial goals we have around earnings growth in particular. And we see the marketing and promotional line as one of the most important levers we have to help us achieve those targets while still funding a significant number of growth initiatives to allow us to continue to grow into the future. So at times, that\u2019s going to drive us above 9%. If you look at this quarter, we actually are at about 10% of revenue this quarter in terms of marketing and promotion. So I guess that historical average is an okay, reasonable guideline, but our real goal is to continue to drive towards the long-term financial targets on the bottom line. In terms of other revenue, I would tell you the ICBC gains were fairly similar both last year and this year in the results. And I don\u2019t know if there is any other particular drivers in that other revenue line as you would imagine, there is a number of things that make that lineup and that can produce a little bit of quarterly volatility, but there is nothing reflective of any longer term trend. \nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. \nRyan Nash - Goldman Sachs: Good evening. Just a follow-up on with your comments pertaining to the government shutdown, I guess first can you give us a sense of how spend volumes progressed during the quarter and while you haven\u2019t seen a direct impact, did you see corporate spend slowing as the shutdown approached? \nJeff Campbell: Well, couple of comments, Ryan. One thing even in three months here I have learned to be a little cautious about is attaching too much significance to daily or weekly trends, because they are volatile. With that caveat, what I would tell you is that we are certainly pleased with the modest sequential improvement in our billed business - it went from 8% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis, and really if I take the time period from the beginning of the quarter on July 1 really to the most recent days, there is no particular trends within that period between the beginning of the quarter and a couple of days ago that show any meaningful variance from that overall sequential trend. So there is just nothing in our data that would support any particular impact amongst our customer base in what they spend money on from the economic turmoil, but boy, I don\u2019t want to in anyway draw a conclusion that the uncertainty being created in DC if it continues isn\u2019t eventually going to cause a real challenge economically for us and for many people. \nRyan Nash - Goldman Sachs: Got it. And then just on an unrelated note, on the NII growth, you noted that loan balances were up 2%, I think you said NII growth was up 9% and I know some of that\u2019s coming from lower funding costs, but it seems like a lot of that is actually coming from the yield side, any \u2013 is there anything seasonal component to that or is there any changes in the underlying portfolio dynamics that drove such a large year-over-year increase? \nJeff Campbell: Well, the short answer is no. So it\u2019s really as simple as the loan balance being up a little bit and the funding costs are really the larger driver, not so much the yield we are getting on loans, but our funding costs are down nicely year-over-year and that\u2019s what drove the 9%. \nRyan Nash - Goldman Sachs: Thanks for taking my questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. \nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Hi just a follow-up on the last question, so what is the opportunity for continuing to reduce funding, cost going forward deposit pricing or makeshift? \nJeff Campbell: Well excellent question so you're correct in terms of the underlying premise of the question which is if you think about the past year you have both frankly a little bit rate environment based on the part of the interest rate curve that drives our funding along with the steady improvement in the mix in particular the larger mix that power the larger portion the deposits or the mix. I would say that we have multiple goals when we think about our overall funding and while minimizing the cost is one of those goals so is having a diverse group or diverse set of sources of funds so it's regularly accessing the various markets from which we get funds so that we maintain a good visibility in the marketplace and so is thinking about the structure of the company both at the parent level as well as the two U.S. banks that are part of American Express and so when you put all of those things together I would say that the steady growth in deposits that you've seen over the last couple of years is probably at least in the near term and a bit of a standstill and so where we\u2019re today we're pretty comfortable and we probably won't be driving that much increase in deposits going forward. So that really leaves our funding costs a function of where interest rates goes if you think about the near-term. \nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then the flip side of them obviously is the yields, can you give us some color on how you\u2019re thinking about positioning AMEX as a competitor in the marketplace, it feels like there's been at the margin more competitive actions taking place on yield trying to attract incremental balances how do you guys think about that? \nJeff Campbell: Well of course there are many different answers to that which market but the U.S. market is certainly the most important market for us financially and to touch on that one a little bit I guess you know our goal is to continue to use a variety of products and initiatives all targeted at trying to grow the franchise with the demographics if you like which are the more affluent, spend centric consumers that value the brand and service and that really is our goal as we think about the design of products, as we think about competitive responses. And we use lots of different attributes of our products and lots of different marketing approaches to try to get at that demographic but trying to out compete people on just offering lower yields or rates does not really rate very highly on our list. And while the competitive environment is certainly a challenging one it's always challenging. You know we feel pretty good about our retention of customers one of the things we talked about if you go back to the August Financial Community Meeting was the fact that if you look at our attrition rates so these are customers or card members in the U.S. who leave us voluntarily. Those attrition rates have steadily declined over the last five years and continue to steadily decline and so when we look at that statistic it makes us feel pretty good about the fact that we remain very competitive in the marketplace and our card members are not being lured away by our competitors in various offers that they have in the marketplace. \nOperator: Thank you will go next to the line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: Couple of questions about marketing, Jeff could you just talk about whether you think just near term are your marketing efforts kind of accelerating or decelerating going as we go into the fourth quarter into 2014? \nJeff Campbell: Well I suppose it's a broad, it's hard to broadly generalize about our marketing efforts because of course we do lots of things and lots of different areas that said with the caveat if you just look at the marketing and promotion expense slide in our slides today, you will see that into third quarter we had the highest spend we have had in quite a number of quarters, but I would say there is really a couple of factors that drive that. One is what we are really focused on is trying to balance our near-term financial performance with the many strong investment and growth opportunities that we see across this company. I would tell you one of the things that perhaps has been one of the more positive surprises as I joined the company \u2013 as I joined the company because I saw lots of great growth opportunities in lots of ways for a company to create value for its shareholders in the coming years. I would say since I got here I have been even more surprised at the breadth and depth of the opportunities we have which are very financially sound, financially positive to grow our franchise. And in fact, our challenge in many ways, Moshe, is to think about how we balance all of those opportunities with the fact that we also need to continue to achieve the steady strong financial performance that we are known for. So in many ways, we never have a shortage of financially sound profitable marketing initiatives to pursue. We have to be thoughtful and prioritize which ones we can afford given our financial targets. What that means is when we are having a financially strong quarter when we did this quarter, it allow us to invest a little bit more in the future. And that\u2019s really what you see I think as you look at that marketing and promotions line. \nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: Got you. There is a follow-up. Can you talk about your approach towards the credit card enhancement products? I mean, have you started to remarket those and what\u2019s best to take after what went on with the CFPB? \nJeff Campbell: Well, obviously another thing I have come to appreciate since I joined the company is the full complexity of the regulatory environment. And we remain incredibly committed as a company to continuing to improve all of our control and compliance efforts and to ensure that our customers always know exactly what they are getting and we deliver exactly what we told them we were going to deliver. And we think we have made significant improvements and we think we still have further to go in many areas. That certainly has had some impact on the full range of products that we offer. And those impacts will probably lessen over time as we continue to strengthen our control and compliance efforts, but we want to be a little bit cautious to make sure that we pace all of our efforts in a way that allows us to be very consistent with what the regulators would like us to do and very consistent what is really in the best interest of our customers and that does mean going a little slower times. Over time, we are quite confident we will be back being as nimble as we have ever been. \nMoshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse: Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. And next we will go to the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: Yes, thanks for taking my call. I am wondering if you could expand on what you said about the billed business trends over the course of the quarter, I think you said there was no meaningful variance, but I wonder how that relates to the change in loan growth from month-to-month, because it seems through the first two months of this quarter, your loans were growing faster than the industry and it\u2019s kind of consistent with high rate of spending growth, but then in September there seemed to be a reversal of that trend? And I had follow-up. \nJeff Campbell: Well, I will say David, well, when we look at that data we don\u2019t see a lot other than what maybe noise and not necessarily yet indicative of any trends. And certainly we would believe that we are still outpacing the overall industry with our loan growth. There are also at times there are seasonal fluctuations I don\u2019t know if there is fluctuations around when holidays occur around Labor Day and when schools start and back-to-school spending all those kinds of things can influence just a little bit. So as we stare at the data, we really have not drawn any conclusions from that month-to-month volatility. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: So we could expect some increase as we head into the fourth quarter again do you think? \nJeff Campbell: Well, that\u2019s\u2026 \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: With that forecast. \nJeff Campbell: I would see with what tonight brings in D.C. and what the fourth quarter overall brings. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: Okay. And then I am sorry if I missed it, but did you say what the gain would be from Publishing from the sale and what the impact on income would be going forward? \nJeff Campbell: So the financial results of the sale of publishing are actually in the third quarter results because while the transaction closed right at the beginning of October because most of the impacts of the sale broadly speaking were known and correct accounting was to go ahead and approve them in the results that we just published today. Now I would point out to you that this was a sale driven by the reality of banking regulations and in fact in the quarter the net of all the costs associated with the sale and the sale itself is very modest loss or very modest negative for the company. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: I was wondering could you tell us how modest the losses in the negative? \nJeff Campbell: No but it was more than modest I would have bothered to call it out I guess part of what you see when you look at some of that professional fee line in the slide and you have a big professional fees there is some cost associated with the sale as well as the business travel transaction and some other items but it was a loss. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: Okay and then going forward should there be any noticeable impact on other income? \nJeff Campbell: So there will be a modest impact on revenues and it was a profitable business for us and as we go forward into Q4 we will help make sure we call out to people what the impact year-over-year was so we don't distort any of the trends but it was a very important business to our card members and customers. It is a great management team and a great business and we\u2019re sorry to see it go but it will not be a meaningful financial event. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: Right -- I know I used up my call but if you just clarify what you said about professional services that's crept up a lot over the last year? How much of that is control and compliance spending and how much is kind of one-time items like the sales and the joint ventures and other investments do you think? \nJeff Campbell: Well there is a couple of things, remember the way we run our technology today a tremendous amount percentage of our development efforts on technology are actually outsourced and run through that professional services lines and so as I mentioned earlier in my remarks it's also true that increasingly many of our growth initiatives are technology oriented which drives more technology application development expense. So that is certainly one and probably the largest significant contributor to the growth in that line. Now you\u2019re correct though that as have all large financial institutions we have significantly increased our spending in the area of control and compliance and there is a significant portion of that spent that also runs through the professional fees line and in addition to rank through the salaries and benefits line. So that is a second component that is not one-time in nature and it will be ongoing and is a very important and will continue to do it. I would say when you look at this quarter's results which have that line of 15% that is not run rate we would expect to be a normal run rate and there were some one-time anomalies including the costs related to the business travel transaction and the publishing sale amongst few others that created a little bit of spike this quarter. \nOperator: Thank you and we will go next to the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities : You\u2019re supplement says that the URR was unchanged this quarter versus last at 98%, can you give us a sense for how it's been trending over the last few quarters if you were to go out an extra decimal point? \nJeff Campbell: Well you give me a heart attack there for a second Bill because if it was 98% we would- \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Sorry, I meant 94%. \nJeff Campbell: Hopefully it says the supplement says 94% which is a good number and that number varies a little bit by a basis point to each quarter because of course there is a very complex set of calculations based on the behavior patterns that we see across tens and millions of members but unbalanced since we last made a methodology update which would have been in Q4 of 2012 the number has been reasonably flat at 94%. \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Okay. And switching gears as a follow-up on credit, we have seen peak losses evolve quite a bit post the crisis, do you think that there is still room for peak losses on the loans that you are originating today to continue to move lower based on the credit quality at which you are underwriting loans currently? \nJeff Campbell: Boy, we are at such a historical low. And as I have learned in the history, I think we have had quite a number or strain of calls like this where you said we are at the historical low, it\u2019s great, but eventually things have to go up and then we have another quarter as we do this time where they have gone down. I would be hesitant to speculate, but Rick, you may want to add some comments if you like a more history. \nRick Petrino: Yes, I think what you said is exactly what we said a couple of times, probably not just as for the number of players in the industry. We continue to see good trends in delinquency. So it\u2019s hard to see any deterioration there, but we continue to enjoy where we are now and haven\u2019t really put in place goals to change the risk profile of the company at this point. \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities: Okay, thanks very much. \nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead. \nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I just had a couple. Number one, just touching on the expenses again, we are hearing over the last couple of quarters that the American Express has been investing quite a bit on \u2013 in big data projects, large data analytics projects and the like and if that\u2019s true then where are lot of those expenses, are those in part of marketing, because they are analytical in nature or in professional services? And should we expect the high level of expenses that continue or would the mix shift more to traditional what we think of is traditional marketing? And the other unrelated question was in terms of the expected or proposed sale of the Business Travel business and the cash of $700 million to $1 billion, it seems like that business was not generating a lot of bottom line profit. So it seems like the bottom line impact should be relatively modest and I say relative compared to the $700 million to $1 billion in cash that you expect to receive. So when you give the cash do you expect that to be additive to your current run rate for buybacks and dividends or how should we think about that? Thank you. \nJeff Campbell: Well, let me take those one at a time. So as I said a few minutes ago, our strategy historically in our technology development area has been to outsource a lot of that work and therefore the costs run through the professional services line. And certainly you have heard us talk a lot about some of the really interesting things we are doing around big data and a portion of that involves some very complex IT work and that is some of what is driving up our technology costs in a very positive way right. I mean, these are \u2013 we would love these into the kinds of growth oriented initiatives than spending that we are really pleased. We have the financial strength to do and still hit our financial targets, but that does run through the professional fees line. It\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving it up. I do want to keep coming back to a 15% year-over-year increase is not what we would expect as an ongoing run rate, but that is part of what\u2019s going on this quarter. To go to the Business Travel transaction, let me just step back for a second. So this is what we are creating here will be a 50:50 joint venture. And we are very excited about this transaction, because we think the influx of the capital from the other partners will really help the joint venture to do a better job. And frankly it\u2019s been able to do for the last few years at growth and investing in technology, because to some of the points I made earlier, we have so many great investment alternatives here at American Express that it had at times been difficult for travel to compete for our investment dollars. So because if there is a joint venture that\u2019s $700 million to $1 billion goes into the joint venture, it does not go into the coffers of American Express and the full expectation is that, that joint venture will use that capital over time to grow and expand as a business and we will benefit from that growth and expansion as a 50% owner of the joint venture. Along those lines, so if you think about the creation of the joint venture, we are contributing the business and a partner is contributing that portion of the capital that will drive some gain which we haven't have yet to quantify until we get closer because the valuation on the joint venture will be based on the capital they are putting in for 50% and that will certainly exceed our current basis. On a go forward basis the joint venture we will account for on an equity method so you won't see the revenues and expenses of the joint venture what you will see will be the earnings and then the last point I would make is you\u2019re correct that the historical contributions of our business travel, business to profits have been fairly modest and volatile in times. It's been a very important and will remain a very important strategic part of the company. Certainly part of the logic and appeal of creating this joint venture is we expect with the resources that the joint venture will have and with the focus that it will have it will become a very profitable and high-growth enterprise and will be pleased to have 50% of it. \nOperator: Thank you. We will go next to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. \nBob Napoli - William Blair: In the press release Ken just mentions that the strength and earnings that you have had this year is going to give you the flexibility to make substantial investments in the fourth quarter. I know there has been a lot of talk around expenses and many times you've reiterated the importance of the growth targets but I'm just wondering if you could with that kind of a call out in the press release what you were thinking I mean the earnings in 2012 were 440 if you look at your 12% to 15% are you looking at it that way in some regards and the minimum of 12% of earnings growth this year and maybe just quantify a little bit or give us a little more color on that call out in the press release. \nJeff Campbell: Well I think Bob we\u2019re always balancing, making sure we achieve the financial targets that we\u2019re known for achieving on a consistent basis with investing to sustain the future and long-term growth of the company. And you saw this quarter our financial strength allowed us to get to a 15% EPS growth number year over year while spending more in the marketing and promotions areas than we spent in many quarters and while also doing some of the things like some of the technology spending we talked over the last couple of questioners which is also very growth oriented and so when you look at what Ken said in the press release today he talks about the flexibility that our financial strength gives us flexibility that gave us to make substantial investment this quarter in marketing and other initiatives. The fourth quarter is another quarter and if you\u2019ve seen one quarter you\u2019ve seen one quarter and we'll as we always do as we get into the fourth quarter make sure we balance what we need to do to achieve our financial targets with what we need to do in the short term with what we need to do to achieve our 2014 but I don't think we intended to make any particular call out on our actions that we would be taking in the fourth quarter in the press release. Okay follow up on the prepaid on the relaunch prepaid and trying to understand a little bit more time you\u2019re expanding the distribution you call out certain retailers and American Express has had a prepaid card on the [indiscernible], several of those retailers is the difference that you're rolling out, you\u2019re going to be getting more space in those new retailers and they will be offering a Bluebird like card but not under the Bluebird name? \nJeff Campbell: Well I would say it's a good question and when you look at a new launch or the relaunch of serve [ph] it involves a range of new product features that makes it a much more comprehensive tool for managing all of your financial affairs. As part of those broader capabilities we\u2019re including a number of new partners and retailers that will help people with a card do cash load and in particular we called out CVS and 7/11. So the combination of the broader, more complete array of features based on what we've learned from Bluebird and other efforts that customers really value and want in these products along with the broader distribution network, we think makes this a very attractive product and we are very excited about the re-launch.  \nBob Napoli - William Blair:   Great, thank you.  \nJeff Campbell:   So operator, I think we have time for one last question.  \nOperator:   Great. That will come from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays.  \nMark DeVries - Barclays:   Thank you. First question is on GNS, how long can that segment continue to grow at the double-digit plus rate on billed businesses? And is any Wells Fargo business in that yet and how big can the Wells Fargo business get for you?  \nJeff Campbell:   Well, a couple of questions. Our GNS business as you really pointed out is both active in the U.S. marketplace as well as internationally. And I might almost take your questions in turn certainly or split it into two parts. In the U.S., we are very excited about the Wells Fargo partnership. You wouldn\u2019t have seen any results from the Wells Fargo partnership in the third quarter results. They are going to begin to do a few pilots in the fourth quarter and the larger rollouts will occur in 2014, but as you know, Wells is very focused on growing its credit card business. They have a tremendous customer base. They are very excited I think about what we are bringing to the partnership and we are very excited about their focus on trying to build broader royalty across their current customer base. We think that\u2019s the model that can be replicated in many other places in the U.S. and we are hopeful that over time you will see more announcements in that arena.   When you go outside the U.S. in the GNS business, I guess I would point out the obvious which is our \u2013 we are still a modestly sized player in many markets around the globe, particularly relative to the too dominant networks. We see tremendous opportunity to continue to grow at the kind of reach you have seen for a very long time, because if you just do the math, we could grow at these rates for very long time and still be the scrappy third competitor trying to bring innovation to the markets and focus on strong customer service and focus on delivering real value to the merchants we have to negotiate with every day. So this is a business that we launched in the late 90s, 1999 I believe. It\u2019s interesting as a newcomer to look at the historical charts on this business, because it took a while to begin to get contraction perhaps like some of our early efforts today may take a while to get traction, but we believe it has tremendous momentum right now and we are very, very excited about the business.   So on that note, I would like to thank everyone for your time and say I am very excited and pleased to be here at American Express. I think we had a tremendous quarter and I look forward to doing many other calls. With that, I am going to turn it back to the operator.  \nOperator:   Thank you.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s 2012 10-K and Q1 2013 10-Q already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2013 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Before I turn the discussion over to Dan, I did want to acknowledge that this will be Dan\u2019s last earnings call as our CFO. He will be leaving Amex after a distinguished 23 year career, including the past six years as CFO, where he has played an important role in building relationships with the investment community. On behalf of all of my colleagues throughout the finance organization, I want to sincerely thank Dan for his many contributions and to wish him the best of luck on his retirement. I also want to recognize that Jeff Campbell is joining us on the call today. Jeff joined Amex from McKesson Corporation where he was Executive Vice President and CFO of the largest healthcare services company in the U.S. Jeff will be assuming CFO duties in early August after we file our second quarter financial results and are we are excited to have him as part of American Express. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I\u2019ll start on slide two, the second quarter 2013 summary of financial performance slide. Total revenues came in at $8.2 billion. That\u2019s 4% higher than a year ago. On an FX adjusted basis it\u2019s also 4%. In the first quarter, the growth rates were 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis. I will speak about the impact of cardmember reimbursements on revenue growth a little later. Net income came in at $1.4 billion, 5% higher; EPS is $1.27, 10% higher as you can see the benefit of our share buyback program. And on the last line you can see that shares outstanding are declining. Return on average equity was 24% in the second quarter. Without the three adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2012, as this is a 12-month rolling calculation, ROE in the second quarter of 2013 would be 27%. Moving to slide three, our metric performance; billed business came in at $237 billion. That\u2019s 7% higher or 8% higher on an FX adjusted basis. That compares to the first quarter when we grew at 6% reported and 7% FX adjusted. So this quarter it\u2019s about 100 basis points better growth rate than the first quarter. Total cards in force are $104 million. That\u2019s a growth of 4%. Proprietary cards grew 2%, which is comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. Average basic cardmember spending is $4,097 in the quarter. That\u2019s up about 4% and reflects the continued strong cardmember engagement that we have seen. Cardmember loans are $63 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 3%, 4% on an FX adjusted basis and reflects continued modest growth in loans. Moving to slide four, this is billed business growth by segment on an FX adjusted basis. So total billed business, the red line, you can see the growth rate increased from 7% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Both ICS, which is International Consumer, the light blue line and GCS, Global Corporate Services, the green line, increased by about 100 basis points. GNS, the yellow line, increased from 12% in the first quarter growth rate to 17% growth in the second quarter, driven by continued strong growth in Japan and accelerated growth in China and Korea due to new partners and product launches. Markets like China have high growth and are strategically important. Moving to slide five, so this is billed business growth by region. So the U.S., the dark blue line, growth is 7% consistent with the first quarter. EMEA, the light blue line and LACC, the yellow line, both have increased their growth rate compared to the first quarter. EMEA is growing at 6% and LACC at 10%. JAPA, the green line, increased from 9% growth to 13% growth driven by Japan, China and Korea. So before I leave this regional section, let me just comment on EC draft proposal that has been in the news today. We put out a press release earlier today based on how the preliminary report has been characterized to us and we made a number of points. First, the publication of the formal proposal by the commission will start a lengthy legislative process and review period. We expect these proposals to prompt extensive debate among many market participants. The proposals focus primarily on and cap interchange fees charged by four-party payment systems, such as Visa and MasterCard. The discount rate that American Express charges to merchants would not be regulated. Our proprietary consumer and corporate card businesses are not covered by the pricing caps. Three-party systems, such as American Express, would only be covered when they license other institutions to issue cards, as in our Global Network Services business. GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business. The provisions that focus on separating the payment network and processing functions do not appear to impact proprietary networks like ours. Given the potential impact on consumers and competition within the European payments sector, American Express has been in touch with senior policy makers at the Commission and will continue to represent its positions vigorously throughout the process. Now, let me be more specific what we mean by GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business. EMEA represents about $100 billion of billed business in 2012. GNS billed business in European Union markets are less than 15% of total EMEA billed business. On page 110 in our Annual Report in footnote number 25, EMEA pre-tax income for 2012 was $505 million. GNS European Union pre-tax income was approximately 12% of EMEA pre-tax income in 2012. So I just wanted to dimensionalize that further for you. There are many aspects to the EC draft proposal. They will play out over time. Some will impact us directly, some will impact us indirectly. We are accustomed to changing business environments and reacting to them in an appropriate manner and we will do the same in this situation. So let me go to slide six. So this is U.S. Consumer Card loans. So the bar represents U.S. cardmember loans and they totaled $54.6 billion in the second quarter of this year. We have a growth rate of 4% and that\u2019s the same as the past two quarters. As I mentioned before, worldwide loans grew 3% and 4% on an FX adjusted basis. The 4% loan growth is driven by growth in billed business. Loan growth is about half the rate of growth in billings on our lending products. Net interest yield, which is at the bottom of this chart, is up 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. It is down sequentially from the first quarter of 2013, which included a reserve reversal for cardmember reimbursements that have been set up in prior periods. As you\u2019ll see in a minute, our credit performance continues to be excellent. But let me comment on interest rates, which have been the focus area in the industry before I move to the next slide. As disclosed in our 10-K, 100 basis point immediate increase in all interest rates would reduce the Company\u2019s net interest income by approximately $220 million over a one-year period. Historically, an increase in long-term rates generally has a minimal impact on our business. However, movements in short-term rates impact earnings. The impact is primarily driven by the fact that we fund a portion of charge card receivables and transacting loan balances, which should not have interest rate revenue streams with variable rate debt. However, historically in rising interest rate environments has also coincided with strong billings and revenue growth. So let me move to slide seven, revenue performance. But before I go, do a review of the individual P&L line items, I want to touch on cardmember reimbursements, which is driven by our continuing commitment to proactively review card practices, identify any issue and remediate them quickly. In both the second quarter of 2013 and second quarter of 2012 these efforts resulted in costs that impacted year-over-year variances on some of our P&L lines. The overall cost related to this work was similar in both this quarter and the second quarter of 2012. However, in the current quarter most of the reimbursements were recorded in revenue reducing revenue. Therefore the revenue growth rate in the second quarter of this year, which was 4% on both our reported and FX adjusted basis, would have been 5% on an FX adjusted basis excluding the impacts of the cardmember reimbursements, same as the first quarter of 2013. A year ago most of the costs were reported in operating expense. The operating expense growth rate in the second quarter of this year is lower due to the reimbursement costs incurred in the prior year. And I\u2019ll provide more detail on adjusted operating expense on slide 13. We\u2019ve also included a reconciliation of the adjustments in Annex 9. We continue to place a premium on self identifying and resolving any customer related issue and we clearly believe that this is the right thing to do for our customers. Now let me go through the specific line items on slide 7. Discount revenue increased 6%, reflecting 7% growth in billed business, partially offset by a decrease in discount rate and faster growth in GNS billings than the overall Company billings growth rate. The discount rate is 2.52% in the second quarter of this year, down 2 basis points from the second quarter of 2012 and flat with the first quarter of 2013. Net card fees increased 5%, as we had higher average fees per card due to fee increases, also due to the increase in the number of proprietary Cards-in-force, and a greater mix of premium products. Travel commissions and fees decreased 5%, driven by a 1% decrease in worldwide travel sales and lower supplier revenues due to the timing of certain contracts. Other commissions and fees are up 5% due to slightly higher late fees and foreign currency conversion revenues. Other revenue is lower by 13%, due to cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of this year, which I discussed a minute ago, as well as the benefit in second quarter of 2012 related to a revised estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques. The second quarter of 2013 includes a gain of $36 million related to the sale of ICBC shares. The second quarter of 2012 had a gain of $30 million related to the sale of ICBC shares. Net interest income increased 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012 reflecting a 3% increase in average cardmember loans. Lower funding costs on the charge card portfolio and an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 9.1% from 9% a year ago. In the second quarter of 2013, our international consumer segment included the impact of some cardmember reimbursements. Moving to slide eight, provisions for losses, the Charge Card provision is $38 million or 23% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and this reflects the fact that we have higher receivables up about 6% year-over-year, slightly higher write-offs and a slightly lower reserve release which was $24 million this year compared to $32 million last year. Cardmember loan provision increased $78 million or 31% reflecting lower reserve releases, this year it was $25 million and last year it was $133 million. So this is the primary driver of the higher provision expense. That was somehow offset by lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year, which were $348 million and that compares to the second quarter of 2012, write-offs of $370 million. So provision is increasing while credit metrics remain stable or improved slightly as we\u2019ll see on the next slide. So slide nine, our lending credit metrics, on the left side of the chart you can see that we continue to have excellent write-off rates at historically low levels of 2%. On the right side is the 30-day past due, which is also stable or slightly improving and again these are historically low numbers. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gains when we invest. Moving to slide 10, so these are our lending reserve coverage metrics and you can see that reserves as a percentage of loans and principal months coverage are lower in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012, as our credit metrics continue to either be stable or improving. Reserves as a percentage of past due are slightly higher than the first quarter as delinquency rate has improved this quarter compared to the first quarter. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate to the risk in our portfolio. So I\u2019ll move to slide 11, which is expense performance. So total expenses improved or grew rather 1% year-over-year. Marketing and promotion increased 2% compared to last year and represents 9.5% of revenues, and I'll cover this in more detail on the following slide. Cardmember rewards reflect higher spending volumes on co-brand and membership reward products. The membership reward ultimate redemption rate is 94% and that's comparable to the ultimate redemption rate that we had in the first quarter. Cardmember services reflect enhanced benefits on our premium card products. Total operating expense decreased 4% reflecting strong expense control as well as cardmembers reimbursement costs in Q2 2012. And I\u2019ll cover this on another slide as well. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2013 was 29.6% reflecting the resolution of certain prior year tax items, while discrete tax items lowered the tax rate in both the second quarter of 2013 and 2012 to be below 30%. Over the past three quarters our tax rate has been 32% or 33% in each of those quarters. So I\u2019ll move to slide 12, so this is marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues. So marketing expense in the second quarter of this year was $786 million compared to $773 million in the second quarter of 2012. As you can see on the right side of the chart, the second quarter was 9.5% of revenues and on track to achieve 9% growth for the year or potentially slightly higher. We continue to invest in our business despite the slow growth economy. Moving to slide 13, so this is operating expense performance, so total operating expense is 4% lower year-over-year, salaries and benefit is flat year-over-year and this reflects some of the benefits from the restructuring that we announced in January. Employee count is 1,300 lower than in the second quarter of 2012. Employee count in the first quarter decreased to 1,100 compared to year-end 2012, but picked up slightly by 200 in the second quarter. We estimate employee count at year-end 2013 will be 4% to 6% lower than the year end 2012. Professional services increased reflecting higher technology development and other net decreased 48% reflecting 89 million more in cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2013. And you can see this on Annex 9. The second quarter of 2012 also included an asset impairment. The second quarter of this year includes the Canadian value added tax benefit that lowered other net expenses. So, moving to slide 14 \u2013 so, this chart shows the adjusted operating expense growth over the past three years. In 2013 and 2014 our target is to grow operating expense at less than 3% each year. You can see the first quarter grew at 1% and while the second quarter decreased 4% after adjusting for the cardmember reimbursements I just discussed, the second quarter of 2013 would have been a reduction in year-over-year expense of 1%. So we were on track to achieve our target of less than 3% annual growth in operating expense for this year. Moving to slide 15, so, this is adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue, and this excludes credit provision. In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first through revenue growth; and second, controlling operating expense while continue to invest in the business. In 2012, in those bars the dotted line is excluding the restructuring charge in cardmember reimbursements that we have had in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart, we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue. Well both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2013 round to 69%, the second quarter ratio is actually slightly lower than the first quarter, if you carry without one more decimal point. Slide 16, so these are our capital ratios. In the second quarter of 2013 our Tier 1 common ratio is 12.5%. In the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of capital, $1.4 billion from net income and $300 million from employee plans. We also distributed $1.7 billion in capital, $1.4 billion through share buybacks and $300 million in dividends. Risk weighted assets increased slightly due to higher receivables. The Basel III implementation from Basel I would have reduced Tier 1 common by 30 basis points, but I would remind you that we have not yet implemented Basel III advanced approach. So there has been much conversation about the new supplemental leverage calculation. So the Tier 1 leverage calculation for us as you can see on the chart is 10.5%. If it is the calculation in the second quarter on a leverage supplementary level basis, it would be 8%, well above the required level of 3%. So our Tier 1 common ratio and leverage ratio provides the Company with a strong capital position. So moving to slide 17, so this is our payout ratio. So our share repurchases are governed by our performance, and our CCAR submission in January 2013. Our plan for 2013 is to repurchase $4 billion. The $1.4 billion in repurchases in the second quarter is consistent with our CCAR submission in January. Moving to slide 18, so this is our U.S. retail deposit balances. So the U.S. retail deposit activity in the quarter, you can see decreased slightly. Our overall funding strategy is to utilize unsecured, securitizations and deposits. In the second quarter we issued $2 billion of unsecured debt. Therefore we did not need to increase deposits. Therefore we decreased deposits slightly. However, within deposits we continue to grow direct deposits by $1.2 billion to $23.1 billion, while third-party CDs and sweeps decreased slightly. On the liquidity front, we continue to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. As of June 30 we had $15.4 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $14.4 billion over the next 12 months thereby meeting our objective. So with that let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the relatively slow growth in the economic environment. In the quarter our spending growth continued to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters. In addition we did see some improvements in our growth rate internationally. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry. Loan growth and slightly lower funding costs led to a 7% increase in net interest income. At the same time lending loss rates remain near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 4%. We continue to consistently grow revenues despite the slow growth environment, and in this quarter the negative impact of cardmember reimbursements. In the quarter operating expense decreased by 4% first year reflecting the strong expense control as well as higher cardmember reimbursements cost in the prior year. We are clearly off to an excellent start with our aim of having operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in the business as marketing and promotion and technology development spending both increased versus prior years. These investments are driving higher average spend and growth in our cardmember base while continuing to build capabilities for the future. Second quarter EPS were $1.27 represents an all-time high, but this benefit from a lower tax rate than recent quarters. EPS growth rate of 10% outpaced revenue growth reflecting the progress we have made on improving operating leverage and our strong capital position. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios. We\u2019ve recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders even in a slow growth environment. So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Campbell for a few remarks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell: Well, thank you Dan and good afternoon everyone. I am excited to have joined American Express this week, and I will look forward in the coming months to spending time with many of you on the call, and to continuing the strong legacy of performance that Dan\u2019s leadership has helped to create here at American Express. So with that Rick?\nRick Petrino: Thanks, Jeff. Okay, so we are going to start the Q&A just before we kick it off, I do want to ask everybody as a courtesy to all those who do want to ask a question, that we strongly encourage you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we can get as many folks on the call as possible. And with that, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited: Yeah, good afternoon. Dan, first let me congratulate you on your ride off into the sunset, it\u2019s been a pleasure.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, thank you.\nCraig Maurer \u2013 CLSA Limited: A question regarding the GNS business in Europe and the 12% of the $505 million you discussed, I am not sure, I don\u2019t think any of us know in terms of the breakdown of GNS revenue, is there any component of that that would be susceptible to the cap that they are placing on interchange or is that strictly network and acquiring fees or is there some level of interchange split with the issuer? And as a follow-up, is there any guidance going forward on cardmember reimbursements that we can think about in terms of suppression of revenue or help on expenses. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: So yes the draft is not even out yet, so getting very specific in terms of answering all the elements of your question is really not possible. I think the main point that we wanted to make is that the cap relates to four party systems, and from our understanding does not relate to three party systems, which is our system therefore our proprietary business, the proprietary consumer business, and our corporate card business is not impacted. However in our GNS business, we think the cap will apply as a result of that we\u2019ll have an impact directly on that business, exactly how it\u2019s going to play out will depend on, exactly what the draft says and the debate that will take place between now and the time that the final rules are issued, which will be several quarters in the future. So it\u2019s hard to be more specific at this point and it is our intent, once we have a chance to read the draft, to touch on this topic at the Financial Community Meeting which will take place on August 8. In terms of cardmember reimbursements, as we identify items we look for root [causes] [ph], and if there is a need for us to modify our procedures going forward, we\u2019ll do that and if it\u2019s appropriate to have reimbursements for customers we\u2019ll do that as well, as I said in the second quarter of last year and this year the numbers are at a similar level. It has varied from quarter-to-quarter in terms of how much it is. Forecasting what might happen in the future is difficult because certainly anything we know about, we have addressed at this juncture, but certainly in the course of our work of reviewing our policies and our practices, it\u2019s potential we could identify other items, and if they do we will remediate those, and if appropriate have reimbursements, but there is really no way to forecast what that might be.\nOperator: Okay. And the next question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Thank you, good evening and congrats Dan. Just two questions; one on Europe, I was just hoping, if you could just talk about, how you would deal with the competitive pressure of lower rates from Visa and MasterCard when domestic interchange rates go down and kind of how you would offset any potential impact to the extent that you have to take your pricing down. And also I just wanted to get a sense of how much of your volume is commercial as well. And then just second that Canadian VAT benefit you mentioned, I just want to know how much that was. Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So certainly as I said, there\u2019s going to be a direct impact as it relates to GNS and the business we do with GNS partners. And then there will be an indirect impact, but that\u2019s something again that will be very dependent on what the final rules actually say, and how we need to react in the marketplace. Certainly we have faced these types of challenges in other markets, and I think we have reacted in a way that's been beneficial in terms of our overall business. It\u2019s hard to really specifically say, what's going to happen, because we don\u2019t even know what the draft rules are exactly nor what the final rules will be. A whole lot will take place in the marketplace. This is something that I think will play out honestly not only over a couple of quarters, but likely over a couple of years, but we will be very thoughtful about how we approach that. In terms of the commercial piece of the European business that\u2019s not disclosure that we\u2019ve historically made at this juncture. I thought the most useful information that was to actually share what percentage the GNS billings were of the total billings in Europe. So hopefully that was helpful. Canadian benefit, kind of falls in this category of an amount we thought was large enough that we should mention, but not large enough to give the dollar amount, which is kind of in our practice on a fair number of items like this, but to let you know that there is something in there that is affecting the line item and therefore the growth rate.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Okay, the next question from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, good evening and Dan, I will also add my congratulations, and it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. I had a follow-up question on the comments that you made. You made it clear that the proprietary business is not covered by the proposed caps. Does that suggest that you will be able to generate premium economics and be able to offer greater rewards, and therefore you have greater value for your customers, and I guess that the logical thought process then, does that put you in a position where you can experience similar results to what you saw in Australia? And I have a follow-up.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah, so I mean currently we have a premium position, right? And that\u2019s what enables us to provide the value in our products that we provide to our customers. And certainly, initially the gap between what our discount rates are and the cap will probably widen that gap somewhat. But realistically we know we\u2019ll have to react to a second place in the marketplace. I don\u2019t want to analogize this exactly to Australia because every market is different, but what we did in Australia actually demonstrates the fact that we have a flexible business model and are thoughtful in terms of how we do react when the environment changes.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And to address some of the concerns that are out there around regulators focusing on the three-party system, can you just talk \u2013 your comments today were very helpful in the release and what you\u2019ve said so far in the call, but can you just give us, I guess more broadly a perspective on whether you\u2019ve ever heard of any regulator, you have any experience with any regulator anywhere around the world, really talk about bifurcating the negotiated merchant discount rate in your proprietary business with the goal of regulating it. I think that's kind of where some people were going and it just seems, I remember from past meetings that we've had with your Head of Global Merchant Services, it seems pretty clear that regulators around the world kind of get your models different because your rates are negotiated. I wonder if that's still a fair, a reasonable way of thinking about it, if you can just comment on that. Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I just said we negotiate our rates with the merchants around the world. Certainly in Australia that regulation didn't address our rates specifically. That was a four-party systems and your understanding of this draft as it was characterized us we don't believe addresses three-party system such as ours. So that seems to be the course of action that happens historically and our understanding of the same plays here. What may happen elsewhere, always time will tell, but that has been the focus historically when it's come to a change of regulation.\nOperator: Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nBrian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research: I guess maybe switching gears to capital, as these Basel III rules firm up, two things, one, is there any reason to think the advanced approach would be a meaningful change from the 12.2%, Basel III you kind of implied by the 30 basis point hit; and is there any reason to think the liquidity coverage ratio is a hurdle that would be an issue in terms of the way you manage the excess liquidity?\nDaniel T. Henry: So the 30 basis points is when we go from Basel I over to Basel III, kind of skipping the Basel II piece, right. It\u2019s hard for me to say what the impact will be until we actually complete the work on the advanced Basel III methodology. It requires the gathering of an enormous amount of information that we have to process with systems. That work is actually underway currently. We actually have scheduled to enter a parallel run in the beginning of 2014, at that juncture we will have a better sense of what the impact would be on capital ratios. So I don\u2019t have an estimate for you at this juncture. In terms of liquidity rules, I guess we don\u2019t have final liquidity rules at this point although from what we understand so far, we think we have a strong liquidity position and don\u2019t, at this moment based on our understanding, think that the new ratios that will phase in over time would have a substantial impact on us. So therefore I would say it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have an impact on kind of how we think about liquidity at the moment.\nBrian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research: One follow-up, I guess on the other expense. All the dimensions you gave are very helpful. But if I just think about it simplistically, I mean, is the $219 million kind of a good run rate for that number or is it better to think about since the Visa and MasterCard benefit rolled off and excluding the quarters where you had the big reimbursements, it\u2019s tended to be more in the kind of $260 million to $270 million range?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, the $219 million, as I said, includes the Canadian item. So I don\u2019t know that I used that number in the first quarter. So in the first quarter of this year we didn\u2019t have any items that we spiked out and it was $246 million.\nBrian D. Foran \u2013 Autonomous Research: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay.\nOperator: Okay. And next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Thank you guys for taking my questions. And Dan, I will miss these conversations and wish you all the best.\nDaniel T. Henry: Thank you.\nRichard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: I\u2019d love to talk a little bit about the nuance of your conversations with the regulators. We\u2019re in a situation now where it appears that the press has seen the documents and what you guys have indicated is you had conversations, it doesn\u2019t sound per se like you\u2019ve actually seen the draft at this point. You guys are very deliberate in your communications, you\u2019re very cautious and you come out with a strong interpretation of how this is going to play out for your guys. I\u2019d love to understand what the dialog was like when it started and make sure that we understand the subtlety of this because it is pretty significant as you can see from how the stock traded around all those today?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah. Well, I haven\u2019t said that. I mean, we\u2019re not necessarily intimating that the conversations of the people who have characterized this to us are the regulators, right? So it is based on our understanding, previously to this leak of the drafts where we would come out and based on the characterizations of those people who have seen the draft and discussed it with us, our sense is that in fact notably different than what we have been thinking about before. However we actually see the draft and get a chance to read it and digest it, then we\u2019ll all even be in a better position, but as you indicated there were certainly notable discussion in the press and activity in our stocks, and so we wanted our press release to share our understanding of where we are even though we haven't read the complete document. And so that's the state of play at the moment. After it is issued on the 24th, we will read it and if there is anything \u2013 any refinements we can make, we will do that at the financial committee meeting on August 8.\nRichard B. Shane \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, I guess we look forward to reading it at the same time you guys do. Thanks guys.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. Next question from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you and good evening gentlemen and Dan, wish you good fortune in your retirement. So thank you very much for the help over the years. My question, I\u2019ll stay around Europe for the moment. Looking at the average cardmember spend, that has been decelerating really for the last several quarters and that has always been one of the metrics that you all have really focused on in terms of the health of the business and obviously there has been a change in strategy, at least there has been some additional products that maybe impacting the numbers, but I guess what I\u2019d like to understand is or get some response from you is, how you\u2019re seeing the deceleration in the average cardmember spend growth? What ultimately will turn that if it\u2019s just purely the weak economy strengthening or if there is something specifically within your strategy set that will drive that or if you expect that to be less going forward just given the nature where you are adding new cards and the like?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yes, so I think, historically our growth in billed business has come from both the combination of the growth in Cards-in-force, as well as growth in average spend. The growth in average spend comes from really two things, in recent history, that is just greater engagement on the part of our current customers who are spending at higher levels, but it\u2019s also coming from our premium strategy. So we\u2019re bringing on higher spending customers compared to what we were doing several years ago, and I think that shift to a more premium mix is influencing as well. However, well first off, the broader economy has an impact here as well and certainly just consumer confidence is the fact in terms of how much people spend. That\u2019s been shifting a little bit recently, certainly things like housing prices firming, stock market doing better are all things that can influence that. But as we have talked about a fair number of times, there is pretty good correlation between billed business for us and GDP and I think the average cardmember spend numbers we see now are being impacted by the fact that GDP is below the average rate that we\u2019ve seen over the last 10 years. And if history is any barometer, and if GDP picks up, you would think, it would have a positive impact on average spend. There is obviously also totally contingent on us having the best value propositions in the marketplace and providing the best service, and that\u2019s what we are focused on. So it\u2019s hard to spike out exactly how each of those things impact average spend, but certainly the general slow growth in the economy I think is a factor here.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you. And just on a clarification or maybe just, if you could provide some senses to what the differences are in the cardmember reimbursements that will either determine whether, it\u2019s a revenue item or an expense, can you give us some examples as to what the cause of that change please?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we think it\u2019s, each items to talk one item this quarter, it\u2019s a number of items in each quarter, and each item is unique. So each quarter we evaluate the items that are in front of us and make the judgment based on our view at that quarter of how it should be categorized, so you can have different types of items in different quarters. That\u2019s really the thing that is the primary driver.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you and best of luck.\nDaniel T. Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, thanks. Just as a follow-up on Ken\u2019s question related to spend growth, outside the acceleration we saw in GNS from new business wins. Do you think particularly here in the U.S., do you think the current run rates are good proxy for what we should see for spend over the next few quarters? Should we expect it to remain stable or just given the fact that we are seeing improvement from the [welfare] fact whether it\u2019s higher home prices and higher markets, should we start seeing that manifesting into higher spend?\nDaniel T. Henry: So as you know me, I don\u2019t want to forecast here, I guess, one of the factors is the grow over later in the year although a lot of steeper thing were earlier in the year. But clearly I think where the economy goes and consumer confidence will also be significant factors about whether it accelerates from here or not.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, and then just a question on expenses, so Europe 69% as a percentage of managed revenues and I know you\u2019ve talked about migrating towards 67% over time, so I guess should we expect to stay at these levels in near-term, and if revenue growth does have to accelerate and we could see a pickup in expenses from here?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we say we went migrate back towards historical levels, okay. We are having to have 2007 on there, which is 67%, but we went and migrate back to the historical levels. If we are successful and it\u2019s our plan to be successful of growing operating expense at less than 3%, that\u2019s going to create leverage and should enable us to continue to improve that number over the next 18 months.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats.\nDaniel T. Henry: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Dan Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hi, Dan. Just a conceptual question, I was looking back in your merchant discount rate, it\u2019s down a couple of basis points over the last 2.5 years. And you just had very strong GNS growth, which I would think would naturally bring that down more and so. I guess my question is, do you really have any sort of core change in your merchant discount rate, when should we think about that as more flattish going forward, the mix?\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, so first GNS is not in the discount rate calculations, it\u2019s really a calculation based on our proprietary business, so that\u2019s not in there. So we have said, in the absence of increasing price anywhere because of our strategies drive further into everyday spend categories, in the normal course we\u2019d expect the discount rate to drop by two or three basis points a year. We in fact have not seen that over the last several years as there have been opportunities where we are bringing greater value to merchants and then obviously we\u2019ve been able to increase price in certain situations, so that the drop in discount rate has been probably more in the 1% or 2% level over the past several years. So if we can drive sufficient volume by moving into new categories and driving volumes up, then I would expect to see some drop in discount rate as we go forward. But that's very much on strategy for what we want to accomplish over the long-term.\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. And then quickly any updates on Bluebird in terms of transaction over fees.\nDaniel T. Henry: So I think we're going to do some updates of the data that we shared at the FCM in February, at the August, FCM. So we'll update that information on August 8.\nDonald Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJames Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Hi. Thanks, and let me echo the congratulations. I want to ask about cards in force, Dan. It was one of the faster growing numbers in the past year up 1.2 million. I guess question in two parts. One is, should that continue to be the emphasis going forward in terms of driving billed business? And two, it looked like about 700,000 of that 1.2 million came from GNS. Should we anticipate going forward that GNS will be the driver of cards in force? It sounded like in your introductory comments it suggests that some of the growth may have come from China. Is that a correct interpretation?\nDaniel T. Henry: So, cards in force number, which is 4% was 2% on proprietary cards. So that\u2019s pretty consistent. We\u2019ve kind of been at the 2%, 3% growth rate over the last five or six quarters. So the growth rate there is very consistent with the last few quarters. The growth rate in the GNS cards at 7% is somewhat lower than what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. It had been kind of in the low-single digits, right. So the lower growth rate is driven by fewer GNS cards in out there. So the growth in our business is going to come, as I said before, from both higher average spend as well as higher number of cards and the fact that cards are growing at 2% and 3% compared to maybe proprietary cards compared to higher levels historically is due to the change in strategy more focused on the premium cards as opposed to just being cards in. In terms of new cards in China, part of what drove the strong performance in GNS and in JAPA, the answer to that is, yes, right. So both in China and Korea we\u2019ve had some new partners signed and some new product launches in those countries, both by new partners and existing partners. So that is part of what\u2019s driving the GNS and JAPA growth rates that we see.\nJames Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Hi. And just as a follow-up housekeeping. So Bluebird is not included in that cards in force type of zone, imagine that\u2019s a pretty big number, but\u2026\nDaniel T. Henry: It\u2019s not included in cards in force, no.\nJames Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay, okay. And at some point will you start to decompose the cards in force at that level? Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: So, I mean currently we share information in terms of what the GNS piece is. I think we can do some geographic splits for you. So, I think that I don\u2019t know that we are going to give more detail on that, it wasn\u2019t in our thinking, but certainly as we move forward we\u2019ll provide information as it relates to new products like Bluebird but we think it\u2019s appropriate.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Dan just help me, if you could provide a little more color on what we can expect on the GNS growth in Asia, you referenced. Is it realistic to think that at least for the next three quarters you\u2019ve got some fairly positive year-over-year comps on that, should we continue to expect to see that kind of robust mid-high teens billed business growth from Asia?\nDaniel T. Henry: So, I don\u2019t want to forecast. In China, it is an important market for us and we\u2019re focused on the partners that we have and the [biologics] that will take place. So my sense is that will be a good growth market, but I don\u2019t want to forecast exactly where our GNS growth is going to be over the next couple of quarters. And also potentially it will be impacted by the economy in China. But right now, our growth rates are being driven there by new partner signings and new product launches.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up, with marketing and promotion expense kind of leveling off on a year-over-year basis, is it reasonable to expect or continue to see kind of the 4% to 5%, cards in force growth that you had over the last year or so?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, we have come up with this 9% number out there. And I don\u2019t want it be a target or a guideline, but I think it\u2019s recognition of the fact that on an annual basis, right we have fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. On an annual basis, we need to increase investments at the rate they were growing the business, if we\u2019re going to continue to have the type of business momentum that we want. So my view is we are very committed to investing in the growth of business. You have seen us do that historically and we will continue to do that. So our view is we want to make sure that there are sufficient investment dollars to sustain the business momentum as we go forward. Certainly the whole focus on reengineering that we announced in January is designed to grow operating expense at a slower rate, so that it provides additional resources for investment in the growth of the business.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, best of luck to you Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. A quick follow-up on the cards in force, it\u2019s my understanding that you had some minor annual fee increases in some of your proprietary products this year and some \u2013 did you see that in the net cards in force, is there any pricing activity across your portfolio, I guess any (inaudible) but it\u2019s significant, is that a contributing factor and is that something you continue to squeeze higher over the years, given the strength of your products and the consumers attraction and loyalty to your products?\nDaniel T. Henry: As we said, there were selected price increases on certain products. We never tried to squeeze out higher fees, we don\u2019t want to increase fees without improving the value proposition for customers, so our practice has been where we increase fees to also avail that increase the value propositions to our customers and we have been very successful at that and when we have had fee increases, we have not seen a notable attrition as a result of that. So it\u2019s all tied into \u2013 we\u2019re delivering value, we\u2019ve increased the value, part of the increase in the fee and probably of course it goes into the bottom line, what portions goes back into increasing the value to the cardmember. That has been our strategy and I think it will be our strategy going forward.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great and then my follow-up question, enterprise growth and your initiatives there, the $3 billion target, I guess and possible with your Bloomberg update for the community meeting in early August, so ultimately feel an update there, I am just curious as to the investments you made over the past several years, serving particular, are we starting to see any meaningful contributions from those new initiatives yet? Any color there would be helpful.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah, so we set a $3 billion target couple of years ago to exit 2014 at that rate. Simply when we set that target, we didn\u2019t necessarily contemplate the economy being as slow as it has been over that period, that number as we\u2019ve disclosed last year was $1.5 billion. So we have a lot of work to do between now and then, but we continue to think that it\u2019s an appropriate target for us to inform. I don\u2019t anticipate us updating that until we update what I just gave now.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And what about the Serve?\nDaniel T. Henry: So, I think one of topics at the meeting will be Dan Schulman and he will talk about what\u2019s taking place both in Serve as well as Bloomberg in particular.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Excellent. Congratulations Dan. Thanks a lot.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, so we\u2019ll just take one more question.\nOperator: Okay and our final question then comes from the line of Brad Ball of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Thanks, and congratulations Dan and good luck in your future endeavors.\nDaniel T. Henry: Thank you.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: I wonder if you can give us a sense for the progression of billings over the course of the quarter, month to months, was it stronger late in the quarter and would you give us an update for July to-date?\nDaniel T. Henry: So the earnings growth over the month-by-month was relatively consistent. There is no sharp upward trend or downward trend. I would say it\u2019s relatively consistent. And we don\u2019t really plan to give an update about what has taken place in July. When you tend to give even a quarter is a short period of time, you try to do it for a couple of weeks. We\u2019ve found the side note necessarily indicative of what\u2019s going to happen to the quarter. But within the quarter, month-by-month, it was relatively consistent.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then one follow-up on the EC proposal, you said in your press release earlier today that separating the payment network and processing functions did not appear to impact proprietary networks like AMX\u2019s. Could you explain what you mean by that and what\u2019s the basis for making that statement?\nDaniel T. Henry: So I am not going to say, I am an expert here. But I think there is some language in there about what you need to split the merchant core processor and the merchant acquirer I guess in the network. In that case, in our case, we do all those functions, so it doesn\u2019t appear to us that that was the applicable in our situation. But again once you get a chance to read the draft, we can address that more specifically.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: So it would apply to a four party system, but not to the three party system, is that\u2026\nDaniel T. Henry: That\u2019s our understanding.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks everybody for joining the call and thank you very much for your congratulations. From my perspective it has been a pleasure dealing with each of you as well and we are highly confident that Jeff will do a terrific job as we go forward. So thanks very much.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this conference will be made available for replay after 7 PM this evening through July 24 at midnight.

Moshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead.\nRichard Petrino: Thank you, Tom. Welcome and we appreciate everyone joining for today\u2019s discussion. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today. The words believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s financial and other goals are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s 2011 10-K already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2013 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior period that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed and provide some brief summary comments. Once Dan completes his remarks, we will move to Q&A. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. Thanks, Rick. So I will start on Slide 2. So the first quarter of 2013, summary of financial performance, so total revenues came in at $7.9 billion for the first quarter of 2013. That\u2019s 4% higher on a reported basis and 5% growth year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. That\u2019s the same FX adjusted revenue growth that we\u2019ve had for the past two quarters. Pre-tax income came in at $1.9 billion, up 8%. Net income came in at $1.3 billion, up 2%. So net income grew at a slower rate than pre-tax income in the first quarter, because in the first quarter of 2012 it included a tax benefit realized on certain foreign tax credits and we had no such item in the first quarter of 2013. Diluted EPS was $1.15, up 7%. EPS grew at a faster pace than net income due to share buybacks. As you can see, shares outstanding on the bottom of this chart are 5% lower year-over-year. ROE is 23% for the quarter compared to 27% in the first quarter 2012, and this is due to the three charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2012, which was about $600 million. So the ROE is calculated using net income for the 12 months ended March 31, 2013. Therefore, it includes the fourth quarter of 2012, and that\u2019s divided by average shareholder equity. Excluding those three charges, in the fourth quarter adjusted ROE would have been 26% and you can actually see that calculation in Annex 6 through the slides. Moving to Slide 3, which is a metric performance. You can see that billed business came in at $224 billion. It grew at 6% on a reported basis, 7% on an FX adjusted basis. So the same FX adjusted growth rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2012, despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter of 2012, because it was a Leap Year. Cards in force grew at 5%, the same as the fourth quarter. Proprietary cards grew at 2%, which is comparable to the growth rate we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Growth in average basic cardmember spending reflects continued strong cardmember engagement and cardmember loans continued modest growth, growing at 4%. Moving to Slide 4, so this is billed business growth by segment and as you can see on the chart, total FX adjusted growth, the redline, in the first quarter of 2013 was 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. Each of the business segments is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012 except for GCS, which is Global Corporate Services, that\u2019s the green line, and you can see here that the growth rate for that segment has moved down slightly as T&E spending grew at a slower rate than total billings growth rate in the quarter. Now, 2012 was a Leap Year, so we lost one day of billing year-over-year, which negatively impacts billed business growth rate in the first quarter of this year by about 100 basis points. Going to Slide 5, this is billed business growth by region. So, you can see that the U.S., which is the dark blue line with the diamonds, grew at 7% consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012. And while each of the other regions had their growth rate slow a bit in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, in aggregate total FX adjusted growth rate of 7% is consistent with last quarter. Then we have Slide 6, so this is the U.S. consumer managed cardmember loans. The bars are the dollar amount of loans, the light blue line is the U.S. consumer loan growth rate and the new line is the green line, and that\u2019s the U.S. industry revolve growth in each of the quarters. So the 4% growth in loans is driven by growth in billed business. Loans are growing at about half the rate of the growth in billings or lending products. Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry, as you can see by looking at the green line. So, for example, in the fourth quarter of this year we grew at 4% and the industry growth rate was 1%. The last point they make is that while loans grew 4% year-over-year, loans decreased sequentially on a seasonal basis from the fourth quarter. As you\u2019ll see in a minute, credit performance continues to be excellent. Slide 7, so this is our revenue performance. Total revenues grew 4%. That\u2019s 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Discount revenue came in at 4%, and this reflects 6% growth in billed business, partially offset by 1 basis point decline in the discount rate and higher cash back rewards. Net card fees increased 7%, and this is reflective of higher average fees per card, primarily due to fee increases and a greater mix of premium products. Travel, commission and fees decreased 3%, as worldwide sales decreased 3%. Business travel declined 4%, while consumer travel sales increased 2%. Other commissions and fees decreased 2%, and this is the impact of some modest cost of cardmember reimbursement, partially offset by higher Loyalty Partner revenues. Other revenues is lower by 3%, and this is primarily due to a favorable revision of our liability for uncashed TCs in international markets in the first quarter of 2012, and is partially offset by higher gains on our sale of ICBC shares in the first quarter of 2013. Net interest income increased 10%, and this is a combination of 3% increase in average cardmember loans, an increase in the worldwide net interest yield to 5.9% from 9.2% a year ago. Now, a portion of this increase is due to the reversal of reserve for cardmember reimbursements that we set up in prior periods and without it, the increase would have been slightly lower. It\u2019s also influenced by a decline in funding cost for our charge card portfolio. Moving to Slide 8, so this is provision for losses. You can see the total provision for losses increased 21%. Charge card provision increased 10%, primarily driven by higher receivables, which are 5% higher than a year ago. Cardmember loan provision increased 30% or $63 million, and this reflects a 4% increase in cardmember loans compared to last year. Our reserve release of about $100 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a reserve release of $200 million in the first quarter of 2012, and this has the effect of increasing provision by $100 million, partially offset by approximately $50 million less in write-offs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, due to improved credit performance. This will net to a $63 million increase in the lending provision. So provision is increasing, while credit metrics are stable and you\u2019ll see that over the next several slides. So Slide 9 is charge card credit performance and if you look at the left charge, this is the U.S. charge write-off rate and this has ticked up and down slightly over the past few quarters, but I view this as stable over the period. On the right side, you see the international consumer and Global Corporate Services net loss ratio and this also has remained stable. Both of these metrics are at historically low levels. Moving to Slide 10, so this is the lending credit performance. The left side is the net write-off rate and this metric continues to be stable. The right side is the 30 days past due and the same is true here. This metric continues to be very stable. So, these metrics are at historically low levels and represent the best credit metrics in the industry. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest. Next is Slide 11; so these are the lending reserve coverage ratios. So each of the metrics, whether it\u2019s reserves as a percentage of loans, reserves as a percentage of past dues, or the principal months coverage, are lower in the first quarter of 2013 compared to last year based on the improved credit metrics, and are trending slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2012 as we continue to sustain historically low credit metrics. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate for the risks that are inherent in our portfolio. Slide 12; so this is expense performance. You can see on the bottom right that total expenses grew 1% year-over-year. Marketing and promotion expense decreased 2%, reflecting lower brand advertising, partially offset by higher card acquisition spending. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in the slide. Next is cardmember rewards expense and this increased 4%, reflecting higher spending on rewards products, partially offset by slower growth in membership rewards ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail on the following slide. Cardmember services decreased slightly. Total operating expense grew 1%, lower than our target of growing total operating expense less than 3% for the next two years and I have a slide on this later as well. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in the first quarter of 2013. This compares with 29.2% in the first quarter of 2012. So lower tax rate in the prior year includes a tax benefit related to the realization of certain tax credits. Moving to Slide 13; so this is marketing and promotion expense. So marketing expense in the first quarter of this year was $621 million. That compares to $631 million in the first quarter of 2012. So, down slightly. As you can see from the chart, it\u2019s also down slightly for marketing as a percentage of revenue. So all the way on the right you can see the percentage for the first quarter of this year was 7.9%, and for last year in the first quarter it was 9.3%. But we remain committed to our objective of having marketing and promotion expense to approximate 9% of revenues on an annual basis. While in the first quarter of 2012 this percentage was 8.3%, if you look at the chart on the right, you can see that we increased spending in the second through fourth quarter to achieve our annual objective, and you can see on the left hand chart that 2012 for the full year came in at 9.2%. We continue to invest in our business, despite the slow growth economy. Slide 14, we\u2019ve cardmember rewards expense. So rewards expense in the first quarter of this year was $1.520 billion. That compares to $1.467 billion in the first quarter of 2012, a 4% increase. So, cardmember rewards expense is a combination of rewards on co-brand products and membership rewards expense. Within membership rewards, it is a combination of expense of points earned in the current period and this is included in the chart along with co-brand expense in the dark blue section of the chart. This section of the bar basically grows with the growth in billed business. Membership rewards expense also includes expense related to changes in the membership rewards liability for points previously earned. This is the green section of the bar. As you can see this portion of expense in the first quarter of 2013 is lower than the first quarter of 2012, as the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 was less than the increase in the ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2012. The ultimate redemption rate in the first quarter of 2013 is 94%, the same as it was in the fourth quarter of 2012. Next slide is Slide 15, operating expense performance. In the quarter, as you can see in the lower right, operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year as we continue to focus on controlling expenses. Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense grow at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years. Salaries and employee benefits decreased 1%, reflecting a decrease in employee count of 1,100 people compared to the first quarter of 2012. Professional services increased 4%, reflecting increased investments in the business and higher legal fees. Occupancy and equipment increased 8%, driven by higher data processing, costs and software amortization. Other net decreased 2% and this is resulting from a favorable impact related to hedging of fixed rate exposures versus an expense in the first quarter of 2012. So this is an accounting adjustment we need to record. These hedges are functioning exactly the way we intended, and over the life of the hedge it will move to zero. Now we go to Slide 16; so this is expense as a percentage of revenue. Now adjusted expense means we\u2019re excluding credit provision. On the left side you can see six years of history, and on the right side you can see the most recent five quarters. The 2010 and 2011 reflect elevated investment levels. In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways; first, through revenue growth, and second, our plans to control operating expense, while continuing to invest in the business. In the bars for 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2012, the dotted line in the bar excludes the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart on the right, we are making substantial progress in reducing adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenues. Moving to Slide 17; so these are capital ratios. In the first quarter of 2013, Tier 1, Tier 1 common and total capital ratios increased due to an increase in capital during the period, primarily driven by capital generation of $1.5 billion. This is a combination of $1.3 billion in net income and $200 million raised from employee plans. Offset by capital distributions of $1.1 billion, and this is $800 million in share repurchases and $300 million in dividends, as well as a decrease in risk-weighted assets mostly due to lower cardmember loans. Tier 1 common capital ratio of 12.6%, provides the company with a strong capital position. Next is Slide 18; this is the total payout ratio. So, this is the percentage of capital generated through net income returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. On the left hand side, we see the past five years. On the right side, we see the most recent five quarters. In 2012, we returned $4 billion or 98% to shareholders. Now, the share repurchase in the first quarter of 2013 was governed by our CCAR submission in January of 2012, and so for the quarter we returned 70% of net income. We plan to increase our dividend to $0.23 per share from $0.20 per share next quarter, a 15% increase for shareholders. We are also moving ahead with plans to repurchase common shares that will total up to $3.2 billion to shareholders during remainder of this year to total of $4 billion in 2013 and up to an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Next slide is Slide 19, our liquidity snapshot. Our objective is to hold excess cash and marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. As you can see, we have $20.9 billion in excess cash compared to funding maturities of $17 billion for next year, thereby meeting our objective. Next is Slide 20. So this is our U.S. retail deposit program and it shows you the deposits by type. As you can see on the right, the deposits increased by $1.1 billion in the quarter, with direct deposits increasing by $2.5 billion and you can see that on the left side of the chart. We remain committed to increasing direct deposits over time. So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance, especially given the slow growth economic environment. In the quarter, spend growth continue to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters, despite the negative impact of having an extra billing day in the first quarter 2012 because of Leap Year. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace the industry. Moderate loan growth and slightly higher net yields led to a 10% increase in net interest income. At the same time, lending loss rates remained near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the sluggish economic environment and the negative impact of having one less day in the quarter versus the prior year. In the quarter, operating expense increased only 1% versus the prior year, as we continue to focus on controlling expenses. Our expense performance is consistent with our aim to have operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than 3% over the next two years. We\u2019re also continuing to invest in the business, and expect full year marketing and promotion expense to be approximately 9% of total revenues, in line with our historical average. EPS growth of 7% outpaced revenue growth, reflecting the progress we have made on controlling operating expense and our strong capital position. We continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios. The results of the recent Fed stress test underscore our capital strength and our ability to remain profitable even under severe stress assumptions. Risk flow in capital position provides flexibility, we are planning to afford 15% increase in our dividend during the second quarter and allow us to balance the capital needs of our business with the potential for significant share buybacks. We recognized that our business is not immune to the economic environment, but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to shareholders even in an extended slow growth environment. Thanks for listening and I\u2019m now ready to take your questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of Ryan Nash representing Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. : Hi, thanks, hi Dan. When you think about your outlook for revenue growth that came in about 5% on FX-adjusted basis quarter below when you\u2019re factoring the FX. So if you\u2019d assume that the revenue trends remain consistent over the next few quarters, how should we think about OpEx growth for the remainder of the year? I know you\u2019re staying less than 3%, but assuming revenues were to stay at the 5% level, do you think we should end up on the low end of that range?\nDaniel T. Henry: So, as we talked about staying, having growth of less than 3%, we really haven\u2019t factored in exactly where revenue growth is going to come in. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the factor in terms of our commitment to keep OpEx growth at less than 3%.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. : Got it, and\u2026\nDaniel T. Henry: So at the FCA we\u2019re trying to give a variety of scenarios in there in terms of what the potential outcomes could be when you vary both revenue growth and operating expense growth, and share repurchases to give you a sense of how each of those items could affect EPS in the several different scenarios.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. : Okay, and in terms of the spend volumes can you give us a sense of how they progressed during the quarter end? At this point, have you seen anything that points a pull back on the part of consumers from higher tax rates?\nDaniel T. Henry: So our spending levels, our FX-adjusted basis have been pretty consistent over two quarters, and we didn\u2019t see any historic trends within the quarter. So whether the change in the tax rate is having a impact that was something that we could concern within our numbers.\nRyan M. Nash \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. : Great, thanks.\nOperator: Question today comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Yeah thank you. I was hoping if I can get like some specifics around the gain that you guys had from the sale of the ICB shares, as well as kind of those benefitted from the reversal of the reserve for cardmember reimbursements? And then secondly, I was just wondering how far we were into the restructuring that you guys have undertaken, and at what point during the year will we hit a level of operating expense, ex-marketing without that overhead? Thank you.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So as we relates to the ICBC shares, we put a hedge on that in the past and have effectively locked in the gain. As you have seen over the last several quarters, we are taking that over time and the reason we\u2019re doing that is to enable higher levels of investment spending to help generate business momentum. So it\u2019s a locked in gain we have in sort of time, our plan to take it over time. With respect to your second question about the reversal of our reserve we put up previously related to cardmember reimbursements. We have come up with an estimate in the fourth quarter, upon further refinements we realize that the announcement we\u2019re going to reimburse is actually lower in our estimate. It\u2019s a relatively small amount, but it did have an effect on the increase in spreads. So I didn\u2019t want people to think that that was a permanent increase that\u2019s really the only reason I spiked it out, but it\u2019s not really a large number at all as it relates to our income. In terms of restructuring, we announced restructuring in January; the impact of employees leaving American Express is actually going to take place over all of 2013. Some have left in March, but others will not leave until later in the year. So we\u2019re only get a portion of the benefit from that actions in 2013 and we\u2019ll get an additional benefit in 2014 as some people would have been here for a portion of 2013. So it\u2019s going to come to us very gradually over 2013 and 2014. And I would say, most employees, the first employees to leave were probably in the March timeframe. So there is a limited amount of benefit from that in the first quarter. So we really see it come to us over the next seven quarters, I would say. The very good control of operating expense is just our continued focus on operating expense which we really started last year, which is rolling over into this year as we see the proper control of expense as a way of creating resources so that we can invest in the business, some of which takes place on marketing portion line, other portions of that actually take place on the operating expense line. So I don\u2019t even know it was only one question. I hope I got each of the four parts correct.\nRichard Petrino: You there?\nOperator: Question? The next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks. Good evening. Dan, I had a follow-up question on slide 16 and the detail that you gave on the expenses. So you\u2019re clearly making progress on reducing expenses, but I wanted to kind of make sure that I was thinking about the commentary that you guys have made correctly. You referred to how in the past that you intended to get debt expense ratio down to historical levels and I thought that you had said in the past that 2007 was kind of a good benchmark so that kind of 67% level and you\u2019re at 69% now in first quarter 2013 and we see the progress you\u2019ve made there. But should we be thinking, is that in fact a fair way to be thinking about it that that 69% over time is going to move towards 67%? And I know you guys don\u2019t want to get locked into a timeframe, but let\u2019s call it the next 12 months to 18 months or so kind of a reasonable timeframe to be thinking about.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah. So I think what we said is we want to move back towards historical levels and 2008 and 2009 are low because it was during the crisis, and 2010 to 2011 are higher because we had all the levels of investment. Soon we\u2019ll lock in exactly on the 67% and certainly want to head back in that direction. How much we actually think this ratio down to will depend on lot of things including where our revenue growth is, what\u2019s in place of provision and what we\u2019re aiming for in terms of what we want to free up for investment capacity. So all those things work together in terms of the pace and the level that we take this ratio to.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And finally as a follow-up, can you give a little bit more color on what drove some of the weakness in GCS billed business, and then, should we expect reserve bills for the rest of the year or should we be looking for more releases? And then, I guess the last part of that is, the travel commissions and fees were little bit lower than what we were expecting. So I wondered if there is any kind of, maybe you could, if there is anything behind that and any kind of impact from the restructuring that we should expect to impact this line item? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay. So let me talk to GCS, so corporate services. So really across the broad we\u2019ve seen lower spending in T&E categories, right and we are seeing better strength outside of the T&E categories. Corporate services is primarily T&E type of spending and so that\u2019s where you see it come down and that\u2019s relatively broad geographically. So it\u2019s just lower T&E type of spending as it\u2019s causing them to be lower, and that actually ties into travel commissions and fee, right. So if T&E spending is lower, then that way it is going to be impacted. Worldwide sales were down 3%, that\u2019s the main driver. Now business travel was down 4%, consumer was actually up 2%, but business travel is much larger than consumer travel and so that\u2019s yielding the lower sales, so it\u2019s the activity in this particular category. In terms of reserve, what\u2019s going to happen with reserves, so we have seen them come down for the last couple of years, actually in the fourth quarter we had a slight reserve billed, but a return this year to a release, but the release was much lower. The way our models work, they use the last 12 months worth of information to do the modeling to the extend we get to a point where the core of it is falling out, this is about the same level as the metrics we have in store. Then you are going to have relatively stable provision, so it\u2019s a relationship of what\u2019s kind of pulling out of the model and what the new quarter going into the model is. So I think most people are anticipating that reserve releases are not going to be in 2013, what they were in prior periods.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Dan, could you walk us through your thoughts behind your revised buyback request under the CCAR process. You only missed the FED\u2019s Tier 1 common buffer by 3 basis points, but then when the subsequent request lowered the buyback request by $1.5 billion, was it communicated to you that would not be allowed to return in excess of 100% of earnings or alternatively did you just want to make sure that you had a really conservative request around 100% that you were confident that they would approve?\nDaniel T. Henry: Right, so they never said to us you can\u2019t be above a 100%, I think stage two, it\u2019s in fact above 100%. And it turns out before our submission and subsequently. So that was not it. Our initial plan we asked for an increase of dividend to $0.23. We asked for a share repurchase of $4.7 billion, all the remainder of \u201913 and $1 billion in the first quarter of next year. Our revised submission, we were asking for the same $0.23 dividend. We dropped our request from $4.7 billion to $3.2 billion this year in cap. The request for the first quarter of next year is the same. So when we prepared our initial submission to the FED under the stress scenario, it was based on our own internal analysis and that internal analysis yielded a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 9.2%, which was above the 5% minimum threshold that the FED reserve has set. However when the Federal Reserve did its own modeling, it generated a confusion that dropped us below that 5% minimum amount. Now the good thing is both on our scenarios and their scenarios, even in the stress situation we have a hue of the process over the nine quarter period. However the FED\u2019s projection of the loan loss provision was $3.1 billion higher than ours. And, was actually $4.6 billion higher than the analysis they had done the prior year, right? So, in 2012, their estimates and ours were relatively close. Our net estimates for 2013 was similar assumptions were 2013 and 2012 were similar. Okay, what the FED has come out in the report that they published they said that some of the reserve models that the FED was using this year had changed substantially all were newly implemented. So, it was that change that caused us to fall below the 5% minimum. Now, as we thought about our revise submission. We didn\u2019t want to putting a submission that just eked us barely over the 5%, and we said where we go back to the request that we have made in \u201912, we thought that was substantial in terms of what we were returning to shareholders and that\u2019s what really drove us at the end of the day. And based on that, when you do that and reduce the share buyback request under the FEDs stress scenario our Tier 1 common ratio comes in at 6.42%, a healthy amount of 5%. So that was really our thinking in how we set our resubmitted request.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, I got it. On a separate fact, when I look at a year or so back, the delta between your billed business growth and loan growth was 10% plus, and I understand you are telling us then you would eventually expect lend to follow spend and those would converge, but now it\u2019s relatively tied I guess there is only about a 240 basis point difference between your proprietary billed business growth and your loan growth which is actually a little bit tighter than I would expect it given your more spend based model, is that relationship in line what you would have expected or is it a sign that you are getting more growth from your revolvers than you are from your transactors here?\nDaniel T. Henry: So given that pre-crisis our loans grew at about the same pace as the growth in billings on lending products okay, that\u2019s separated while during the crisis as consumers started to de-leverage. What we have said, I think is that what the growth in loans will be in relation to the business is totally depended on our customers. Right, they are going to decide what amount of leverage that they want to have, although intuitively, at least in the near term didn\u2019t seen that we moved back to where we were pre-crisis. In the fourth quarter loan growth came closer to billings growth, but in the first quarter the growth in loans was about half the rate of the growth in billed business, it is kind of been about that level for several quarters. Now whether it goes up or down from there as I said depending on the customers, we give products to customers, we give them the opportunity to revolve if they choose, as you know probably the number of customers that we have that have lending products that are actually transactors they are very much in the high 20s, right. But if those customers choose to revolve the products design to allow, so it will be driven not by us, but by the choice of the customer and we will rely on the credit capabilities we have to properly monitor that, and you can see that while we are having loan growth even though really no one else in the industry is at the moment, our credit metrics were excellent. So, it\u2019s really be driven by the behavior of the customer.\nMark C. DeVries \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with the Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Dan, sort of looking at billed business in the U.S, I mean effectively your growth rates you could argue accelerated a bit and you\u2019ve got the banks and JPMorgan sort of coming at the affluent side, I mean I guess my question is, do you still think you are gaining share, how is growth so stable and good. I mean is there anything specific in terms of sort of a income breakdown where they super affluent is maybe stronger, I mean are you just seeing across the board decent numbers?\nDaniel T. Henry: Our customer basis is primarily affluent customer base and as I said before we don\u2019t see any discernible impact of taxes on our base. As you said in the U.S, we had some pretty consistent performance over the last several quarters that we are pleased with, given where GDP is, and the fact that it\u2019s a sluggish economy. Now we always have the fact that lots of our competitors want to be in our space and we mean to continue to innovate and provide to as a service to customers to maintain the kind of performance that we have, but and we haven\u2019t done analysis to distinguish by income level within our customer base, but it\u2019s pretty good performance over of what based of our products that\u2019s giving us this stable growth.\nDonald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. And then, in terms of the Chase, Visa deal, I guess, some have suggested that maybe that could be a competitor for us to AmEx because of the closed loop. I mean is there anything specific that they could do that\u2019s incremental, is there any sort of incremental competitive threat from that you see today?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, they\u2019re trying to replicate our closed loop. I think people realized that that has value. But the number of customers that actually operate within that space is limited. Right, it has to be a Chase customer and a merchant that uses their merchant-acquiring process. And we add that all up, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very large piece of the total universe. So is it something that will enable them to achieve growth. I think it likely is, but I don\u2019t see it as a large threat as our closed loop covers all our merchants and all of our customers.\nDonald Fandettin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll go to line of Ken Bruce representing Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good evening. Firstly, I appreciate the commentary in your prepared remarks as it relates to the marketing and promotion expense and expense levels in general. I do want to make sure I understand some of your comments there and my question will tie in with some of the others. But firstly, you\u2019d mentioned that marketing and promotion expense, running at 7.9% in the quarter, likely going to go higher just in terms of where you expect to run it on a more stable state basis, and I want to make sure that that\u2019s your outlook is for marketing promotion as a percentage of managed revenue to rise. And then within the context of your marketing and promotion expenses, you had pointed out that brand advertising was down and acquisition costs or acquisition spending was up. And I want to understand, maybe you can dimensionalize if there has been any changes in terms of what is the discretionary side of the expense versus what is more cardmember behavior, if you have seen any change in the outlook for where you want to invest, whether that would be geographically or within products and get a sense as to how you are looking at the investment horizon, if you could provide some color on those areas, please?\nDaniel T. Henry: So what we have said is, our objective is for marketing and promotion on an annual basis to be about 9%, it\u2019s not a forecast that that\u2019s our objective. I was just putting out that last year, we had got marketing as a percentage of revenue down in the first quarter. We\u2019ve done that again. But again we aren\u2019t changing our objective of being at that 9% level. The commentary say we took brand down a little bit and acquisition up a little bit was going to say we had a strategy change in terms of the mix, which is say, during this quarter, when we had lower expenses coming more from the brand side and that our acquisition engine to bringing customers was actually at or little above what we have in the past. So it\u2019s really just to give you a sense of how we allocate within the quarter. Every year, we look at all of the opportunities we have in terms of where we spend our marketing dollars, whether it\u2019s on brand, or charge in the U.S. or charge internationally, our lending products or co-branded products. And we have pretty refined models in terms of what the expected economic gain of those investments are and that\u2019s what really drives where we put the dollars. Obviously, it\u2019s a lot easier to measure when you do an acquisition, because you can see the actual cards that come in and we have a pretty good idea how they\u2019re going to perform, but I guess things like brand advertising, if you don\u2019t have that nice mathematical calculation. We know this is certain amount that you want to do. And if you do, you will have good products and good brand advertising and that\u2019s where you want to be. Because it\u2019s really driven by which investments give us the greatest economic gain, it will drive what geography and what products we put the investments behind.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And as a follow-up are you, when you look at brand versus acquisition expenditures, it feels that the branding is very discretionary, but ultimately as a longer payback window versus you know the acquisition investments that you maybe making, which are harder to pullback and trying to get a sense as to how much of this maybe in reaction to, meeting some shorter term financial objectives versus any change in the overall outlook for investment in your business?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, I think we need, so for the marketing and promotion just about maybe not 100%, but very, very large, it's completely discretionary. Right, Then we can decide to either do or not do, so it\u2019s not like a fixed cost of having employees within the company. So, it is just a matter of, I think we recognized that we can take marketing and promotion down in any quarter or for a couple of quarters in fact as we did back in \u201808 and \u201809. And there is really no negative impact to the franchise, you couldn\u2019t do that longer-term. So this is just in recognizing in the first quarter. We\u2019ve taken it down some. We\u2019re committed to hit the objective that we set and we chose in this particular quarter to have brand come down and acquisition go up, but that can change from quarter-to-quarter depending on what we\u2019re endeavoring to achieve.\nKenneth Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Yeah. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Chris Brendler representing Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, thanks. Good evening. Dan, if you could gently touch on the lending business one more time. The margin seems to pop up a little bit in the first quarter. Anything going on there, is it sustainable. And also just sitting back a little bit, the lending business also seems to be going fairly well. As you mentioned you\u2019re doing receivables better than almost anyone in the industry, the margins are healthy, credits at all-time lows. Any change in strategy around lending and given that this, the weakness in other parts of the business, is there any desire to increase your focus on lending and can you just comment at all on your use of teaser rates currently? Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: All right. So I\u2019ll start with teaser rates. So others are using balanced transfers with zero for a certain period of time. That is not a strategy that we are following. So we\u2019re not growing loans by putting teaser rates out there. The growth in our loans is coming by as a result of cardmember spending, the business spending on our products which is what we want them to do. Coming out of the crisis, we did have a shift in our lending strategy, right. So we weren\u2019t coming out of the crisis to be focused on premium lending, right. So that was a change. So that\u2019s really a change that we put in place back in 2009 and we\u2019ve continued to execute against that. We\u2019ve shared information about what percentage of lending customers actually are transactors, and that has increased quite a bit over the last several years, and as a result of the premium lending strategy, we\u2019re focused on cards that have higher spending on them, so we have also shared the percentage of customers who have a tenure of less than 2.5 years with us so there is a lot less than it was again five years because we are bring fewer products right?\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right\nDaniel T. Henry : That\u2019s helpful from our credit perspective as well, so I think you\u2019re putting a number of metrics out there show that we not only talking about a premium lending strategy, but actually executing against it. We can actually see that average cardmember spending is in the whole base is growing up. So that has been something of a change because changing some strategy changes that we made a couple of years ago. Lending products for credit worthy customer, our products that have good economics associated with it, and so we were grow both charge card and premium lending and as I said before, which ones we are actually investing against is based on the return that we think we\u2019ll get out of each investment.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Any comment on the manager\u2019s margin and then also separately can you also comment on fraud? I heard more and more concerned about fraud but the lack of EMB in the U.S. and this year plan to start issuing EMB cards in the U.S. an update there. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: So net yield is at 9.5% in the quarter, up about 30 basis points from last year, I made a comment that a part of that increase had to do with adjusting of our reserves, I wouldn\u2019t expect to stay at exactly 9.5%. Coming out of the crisis or actually coming out of the new regulations that we had. We had said, 9% was about our yield prior to those regulations and our intend was for our yield to be about 9% after those regulations with the changes we have made in our products, so we have achieved that and slightly more. So on our lending products, we are getting good growth, low credit losses and good yields and that\u2019s a pretty good combination to have, right. So we are very pleased with how our lending products are performing. As it relates to fraud, our fraud losses are less than half of what we see across the industry and I think that\u2019s the benefit of having very good gross proceeds to money growth, it\u2019s probably one of the benefits of closed loop and we have not seen any notable tick-up in fraud in our core business. As it relates to EMV, we have started to put EMV chips on some of our premium products or products for customers who travel expensively, so that they have the best utilization possible quite frankly outside the U.S., but I think gradually within the U.S. we put EMV on to our cards over a number of years.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No big roll out plan for this year, Dan?\nDaniel T. Henry: It\u2019s going to be a very gradual roll out over several years, I would say, so no big push to do it in 2013, but it\u2019s a gradual undertaking for us.\nChris Brendler \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good evening.\nDaniel T. Henry: Hi.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Couple of questions; one is just on the travel segment. Travel segment have been relatively weak thinking about just airline and airline seat capacity, and I\u2019m wondering how much of that may have impacted your first quarter in terms of billed business.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah. So I think I mentioned before, the reason that Corporate Services was down in terms of growth rate, the growth rate was lower, was that we were seeing weakness in T&E spend compared to our average. So we saw that in all of our products. It\u2019s a bigger percentage of Corporate Services. So it had a bigger impact there. So it was impacting growth in the quarter.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, but no sense of degree of impact?\nDaniel T. Henry: It\u2019s hard to tease out exactly. I guess I would say that was little bit, overall we\u2019re very pleased with our aggregate growth rate given the sluggish economy.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. And then on slide five, just looking at the different billed business growth rates per region, it\u2019s kind of interesting that they\u2019re somewhat coming together fairly tightly and I\u2019m wondering how you guys are thinking about that, is this new normal where distribution of growth rate across the globe is likely to be running more similarly or do you have a different outlook than what you experienced this quarter?\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah. I think there have been times when it kind of moves together like it is now and I think to be a time where it performs again. Let\u2019s say EMEA is slower than the other regions and so kind of figure out exactly all the issues and problems. It could well be in the EMEA space kind of in the lower part of the chart. We think JAPA is being impacted by China. So it\u2019s good growth rates, but not the growth rates that they had in recent history that impacts countries like Australia. So it\u2019s really very much going to be driven by the economies in those regions in large part.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. And then, just lastly couple of questions on Bluebird. I wanted to understand the impact of adding a checking feature and the FDIC insurance on Bluebird, and if there has been much in a way of any effort to expand the merchant acceptance to attract more Bluebird spend?\nDaniel T. Henry: So, Bluebird products were all reloadable products, are accepted across our whole network, right. So you can use any of those products in any location where American Express product is accepted. The FDIC insurance we put on because it refer some customers that they matter, and also to load certain checks like government checks or your tax refund bond, it had to be FDIC insured. And in terms of the check writing, we just want to have a full suite of options for customers. So it\u2019s the best possible product for them.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So have you seen any uptick in growth rate beyond what you were experiencing before post the FDIC announcement?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, they just went on. So it\u2019s hard to measure, but we are seeing healthy in renewable prepaid across that product set.\nBetsy L. Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then, the question on the merchant acceptance. Again that BlueBird is accepted at any merchant who access AmEx. So I guess the question is, does a reloadable prepaid card user seek a potentially different kind of merchant addition to the merchants that AmEx has today?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we say it\u2019s possible, but we do have an initiative to, so we\u2019ve always had initiative to expand merchant coverage. So I think a small merchants is a particular initiative within 2013 and we\u2019re trying to expand it. So it\u2019s very much in line, it will be good for customers who use reloadable prepaid, will be good for our customers who use our corporate card as well. So let\u2019s do the next question if you could.\nRichard Petrino: Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: This will be the last question. Well, two more questions. Two more questions. Okay.\nOperator: All right. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Brad Ball with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Thanks Dan. A lot of my questions have been asked. Just you mentioned that you were experiencing higher cash back rewards. Is that a contra-revenue item and how many of your \u2013 what proportion of your customers are using cash back?\nDaniel T. Henry:\n :\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: And is it a product that resembles the products that are in the market, 1% type cash back on all outstanding that kind of product?\nDaniel T. Henry: Well, these products is a little different, but it\u2019s basically a percentage of spend you get and sometimes there is higher rewards in particular categories either on a product feature basis or on a promotion basis.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay. And then one other. You had mentioned that other revenue were helped by higher loyalty partner revenues.\nDaniel T. Henry: Yeah.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: Can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of the contribution there and just broadly how are you tracking to the $3 billion target for fee revenues?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we\u2019ll be partnered as a substantial business. However it\u2019s one business in a very large company, but they are performing nicely, very much in line with our expectations and it\u2019s the one spot that we think is going to help us achieve our $3 billion target. As we said, we are kind of halfway through the timeframe of achieving that target, which we still think is appropriate. It will be different fee businesses like certified, royalty edge, royalty partner, revolver prepaid, that we\u2019re looking forward to get us there. And as of 2012 we stood at $1.5 billion that was up 15% from the prior year. We recognized $3 billion an ambitious target particularly in a sluggish economy, and we had a fair amount of work to do as we go forward. Our royalty partner, reloadable prepaid are two examples of how we\u2019re diversifying our base and we expect those to ramp up as we hit towards the end of 2014, which is when we\u2019re shooting to be at a run rate of $3 billion.\nBradley G. Ball \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.: That\u2019s great. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Last question.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: Great thanks. Just to comment about the bank stock gain, could you just tell us how much is left in that that you\u2019re releasing kind of overtime when you said you needed the earnings for marketing purposes? And I\u2019ve got a follow-up?\nDaniel T. Henry: So we\u2019ve taken gains, I think over the past six quarters or so seven quarters, the hedge still runs for into next year sometime, probably towards the middle of next year. So I would expect we\u2019re going to take gains pretty evenly over the next six or seven quarters.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: All right. And just on the reserving, I mean, if you kind of take the analysis that you described, and look at what kind of forward 12 months would have been at the end of this quarter versus at the beginning, you're kind of down 3% or 4% in terms of charge-offs. But I guess, given that\u2026?\nDaniel T. Henry: Could you start the sentence again because I didn\u2019t catch up with you?\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: Yeah, sure. Basically, you had said that with respect to reserving, that you kind of look at the forward kind of 12 month losses and if a quarter drops out that had higher losses and, in that exact analysis I mean taken literally, your losses are down 3% or 4%. So, kind of with the reserve drop we saw seems reasonable. How do you factor in the idea of growth because you've gone from 14 months of coverage at the current rate to 13 which kind of implies that you're not leaving as much room for either growth or any kind of deterioration in the existing rate.\nDaniel T. Henry: We actually use 12 months looking back. All right, so we use historical information to seat our models. That\u2019s striving the reserve.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: Okay. So the growth has nothing to do with it, expected loan growth?\nDaniel T. Henry: No, we\u2019re looking at the behavior of our portfolio right? And if you have loan growth, we\u2019re assuming I guess apparently that loan growth will have a similar loss aspect to it as our existing book of business. And we\u2019re not putting reserves on our books today for loans that we put on in the future. So, this is, what is the reserve you need for the loans that are already booked at this moment.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities: Got you. Okay. Thanks.\nDaniel T. Henry: Okay, so thanks everybody for joining the call. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to your host, Rick Petrino. Please, go ahead sir.\nRick Petrino: Thank you. Welcome and we appreciate everyone joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior period that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings to the series of slides included with the earning documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone, happy to be here to discuss the results that we reported today for both the fourth quarter and full year 2014. We are pleased to see both our fourth quarter and full year EPS growth rates at 15% and 14% respectively, within our on-average and overtime targets. This solid performance reflected familiar themes across the entire year, higher spending by our card members, modest acceleration in U.S. loan growth, credit indicators at or near historical lows, strong cost controls and a healthy balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year. There was some complexity to our results this quarter and year. As we took advantage of the Q4 gain on the sale of our investment in Concur Technologies. And the Q2 gain on the creation of the business travel joint venture to fund incremental initiatives to position the company for the long term. This quarter, these initiatives included a restructuring, incremental investment in growth initiatives and an upfront cost related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines. Given the increasingly competitive environment for co-branded partnerships, we are excited to have extended our relationship with Delta for the long-term. More broadly, we believe all of these incremental initiatives will provide flexibility as we deal proactively with the global economic competitive regulatory environment that continues to be uncertain and rapidly changing. As I begin with the financial summary on Page 2 of the Slide, I\u2019ll discuss both the quarter and full year results. As we believe this helps highlight some of the key performance trends and challenges we face as we enter 2015. Our reported billings growth was 6% during the fourth quarter, but 8% on an FX adjusted basis. As we like many other global companies had a significant negative impact on our growth rates this quarter from the strengthening U.S. dollar. For the year, we exceeded $1 trillion of spending on our network for the first time. We build business up 9% versus last year on an FX adjusted basis. As you can see we exited the year slightly below our full year FX adjusted growth rate, as we did see a modest deceleration in billings growth during the fourth quarter. I\u2019ll provide more details on our Q4 billings performance in a few minutes. So clearly the sharp drop in gas prices and soft December retail sales for the industry had an impact on our results. During the quarter, adjusted for the Concur gain, which is reported in revenue and for the business travel revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 3% to 5% when you further adjust for FX. The FX adjusted growth rate is consistent with our full year performance, otherwise note that the drag from FX on our revenue and earnings increased over the course of 2014 due to the strengthening of the dollar. Pretax income grew 12% during the quarter and 14% for the year in part benefiting from our continued disciplined control of operating expenses. Net income grew more slowly at 11% for the quarter and 10% for the year. We have seen higher tax rate throughout the course of the year and the tax rate in the fourth quarter of 35% was a bit above the full year level and above what we might expect going forward. Helping us again this year has been our share repurchase activity. Over the last four quarters, we have repurchased $4.4 billion in common shares, which has reduced our average shares outstanding by 4% versus the prior year. Addedall upand during 2014, we delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.39 and full year EPS of $5.56, which were up 15% and 14% respectively versus the prior year and we are within our on average and overtime target. We were able to generate these earnings with revenue growth that was solid given the uncertain global economic environment, disciplined expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ending December 31 to 29%, well above our on average and overtime target of 25%. Let\u2019s move on to a detailed review of our Q4 results, beginning with the impact of the Concur gain and related incremental initiatives. As you recall, we entered into an operating agreement and made a strategic investment in, Concur back to 2008. The partnership has created significant value for both our customers and shareholders. During December SAP acquired 100% of Concur, including our entire investment, triggering a pretax gain of $719 million inline with our previous estimates. Going forward our operating agreements with Concur we concurred are continue and we look forward to a continuing partnership with both SAP and Concur. In the quarter, consistent with our previously announced expectations which took advantage of the gain to fund initiatives that included a restructuring and upfront cost related to our decision to accelerate renewal of our relationship with delta and incremental investments in growth initiatives. Given the rapid changes in our industry and the sizable set of economically attractive growth opportunities that our company has, we believe that these were the right long-term decisions for shareholders. Starting with the restructuring charge, the actions we were taking will impact over 4,000 people at a cost of $313 million in the quarter. Total employee headcount will decline by a smaller amount as certain of those reductions will be partially offset by jobs created elsewhere in the company. The actions we are taking largely represent a continuation of our strategy to further increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Our business and industry continue to be transformed by technology, which is increasingly becoming more powerful and less expensive. Technology is also changing the way our merchants and card members want to interact with us and has created new channels of communication that have increased overall card members satisfaction. As a result of these changes, we have the need and the opportunity to continuously evolve our organization and cost structure, giving us the ability to maintain tight control of operating expenses while still investing for growth. We also used a portion of the Concur gain in conjunction with the renewal of our relationship with Delta Air Lines. We are excited about the new agreement with Delta. Particularly given the increasingly, competitive environment for co-brands. We decided to accelerate the Delta renewal as we saw an attractive opportunity to extend a long-term relationship with the key partner. Our new agreement had an upfront cost of approximately $109 million in Q4 related to the new contract terms around Membership Rewards, including a small impact related to a previously announced cap on point transfers into Delta SkyMiles for membership awards. This cap was removed as part of our new agreement, which we believe is good news for our card members. As a reminder, we took a similar upfront charge back in 2008, when we last renewed our partnership with Delta or generally often when long-term, co-branded partnerships are renewed, the new agreement will reflect shifts in market economics that have evolved over many years. All things being equal, our renewed co-brand agreement will often provide us with lower economics initially than the prior agreement and will be structured to inset growth and generate additional revenues for both parties over time. The magnitude of this reset could be significant depending on the size of each partnership. Our agreement with Delta is no exception to these market realities. I told, we feel very positive about the potential of the renewed relationship to generate benefits over the longer-term. However when we think about our near-term outlook, we will need to take into account the impact of the new agreement. Looking at the entire landscape for co-brand products, well the competitive environment has become more intense; we continue to see attractive opportunities. We\u2019ve been very disciplined and selective in the partners we work with and have focused on the relationships that can offer the best value, the best growth potential, and the best returns over time. In this context, we were also pleased to recently renew our long-term relationship with Starwood, as with Delta, we believe that this relationship provides attractive value for card members and opportunities for growth going forward. Coming back now to how we leverage the Concur gain during the quarter on Slide 3. You see that we also made incremental investments in the diverse set of growth opportunities within our company. These investments were primarily; do not entirely in marketing and promotion and we\u2019re focused on acquisition activities across the strong suite of products we offer to consumers, small businesses, and corporations around the world. I remind you that our co-brands are one important component of our business model. We believe that the great of breadth and global nature of our product set provides a significant competitive advantage. Going to the numbers, well, there is some subjectivity in determining the level of incremental investments that we made as a result of the Concur gain. It was a significant amount in the quarter, leaving a net gain from Concur of approximately $0.05 to $0.06. Thinking about our overall results, some of the other way, it clearly has a negative foreign exchange impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar, as well as a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter. Let\u2019s turn now to a more detailed view of quarterly performance metrics, starting with Billed business in Slide 4. During the fourth quarter, Billed business growth slowed sequentially from 9% to 6% on a reported basis. The decline was impacted by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar as FX adjusted billings grew by 8% during the fourth quarter. Looking at the results by segments, you can see the growth in our U.S. consumer and small business segments slowed sequentially from 9% to 8% in Q4. This sequential decline was influenced by the large drop in gas prices, relatively soft retail sales industry wide during the month of December. GNS continues to be our strongest performing segment with FX adjusted growth of 15% during the quarter. And while FX adjusted growth in ICS slowed to 3% during the quarter, we saw a very different performance trends by region, as you can see by moving to Slide 5. Here you can see the billings in our LACC region dropped more significantly during the fourth quarter, due to a decline in spent at Costco Canada. While American Express cards were still accepted in Costco warehouses throughout Canada during the quarter, we began to see billings decline after card acceptance was expanded to include other networks on October 1. I would remind you that beginning January 1, 2015 American Express cards were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada which we expect will drive billings growth lower during 2015. In contrast to the LACC experience we saw continued improvement in our EMEA billings which showed their strongest FX adjusted growth since Q2, 2011. The increase was driven primarily by strong performance in the UK and improved growth in Germany. All of these results outside the U.S. were impacted by foreign exchange movements, which is why we\u2019ve added Slide 6 this quarter which is a slide that shows our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters. As you can see during the fourth quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our reported results than in prior periods, dragging adjusted revenue growth by approximately 240 basis points. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have also provided some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency. The first row at the bottom of the chart shows the approximate range of billed business by card members in each market has as a percentage of total company billed business and the second row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency prepared to U.S. dollar. Can you look at the slide? It is somewhat unusual that the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all of the international currencies where we generate a significant amount of revenue. As you know, this revenue in fact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies. There is a bottom-line impact especially when rates move this dramatically. As you can see in our annual report, we estimate that a 10% strengthening of the dollar against all international currencies in which we do business, would cost approximately $200 million in pretax income over a one-year period. So clearly, as I mentioned earlier, it was a negative impact to our bottom line. Over the long-term, we continue to believe that being a global company, which generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a significant benefit of our business model. However, if current trends do continue, FX rates will represent a headwind as we head into 2015. Moving on now to loan growth on Slide 7. Loan growth was up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. We were obviously pleased though by our performance in the U.S. which constitutes the majority of our loans as growth improved to 7% during Q4 and continues to outpace the industry. I note that international loan growth was down year-over-year as performance was negatively impacted by FX rates and also by a decline in loans within the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Our efforts here are not about a transformational shift away from our spend-centric model, but still do represent a sizable growth opportunity for our company. So let\u2019s move now to our revenue performance on Slide 8 where you see there are reported revenue growth in Q4 was 7%, adjusted, however, for the Concur gain, the loss of business travel revenues in the prior year and FX. Adjusted revenue growth was 5%, which was consistent with our full year performance. I note that the Concur gain is reported in other revenue, which is still the large year-over-year increase in that line. The largest contribution to adjusted revenue growth again came greater discount revenue from the higher billed business volumes. As we saw last quarter, there was roughly 400 basis point gap between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. The first driver of this difference is the reported discount rate, which was down three basis points versus the prior year. As a reminder, we provide this reported discount rate calculation to give you some context about our pricing at point of sale with merchants. This quarter\u2019s decline reflects in part our ongoing makeshift in volumes towards lower discount rate industries, so this impact was partially offset in the current quarter by the drop in Costco Canada merchant volume where we earned a lower discount rate. This quarter\u2019s discount rate was also impacted by the timing of certain merchant contract signings. The quarter\u2019s discount rate also reflects a modest, but growing impact related to the OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network. We are encouraged by our progress in this multiyear effort, it does results in some incremental pressure on a reported discount rate as we have previously discussed. But I would remind that a portion of this decline is offset through reduced operating expenses as OptBlue shifts the impact of certain third party acquisition activities from operating expenses to discount revenue. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes on to our network over the next several years and provide attractive economies for our business. Coming back now to the broader relationship between discount revenue and billed business, similar to last quarter the other drivers of the gap between the two of the faster growth we\u2019re seeing in both contra revenue items, such as cash incentives and GNS volumes. I would point out here that the relationship between discount revenue and billed business has become more complicated overtime, partially due to the impact related to OptBlue I just mentioned. And so interpreting our discount rate metric in isolation has become more complex as our business has evolved. Now, turning to the other revenue lines, net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth, growing 8% is we continue to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with business travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L. Turning now to credit performance on Slide 9, you can see that our lending credit metrics remained near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates and delinquency rates declined slightly during the quarter though overall, the rate of improvement in these metrics has slowed past year As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore at some point we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels. In terms of lending reserve coverage levels, Slide 10, shows the coverage remained relatively consistent after considering the impact of the seasonal ramp up in loan balances on the month coverage metric. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. Putting together, our solid loan growth with these credit metrics, you can see on Slide 11, the total provision in Q4 increased significantly versus both last year and the prior quarter. Although credit metrics remained low and write-offs remain a bit below the prior year, the rate of improvement has slowed. The strength along with the growth and seasonal uptick and loan balances and some smaller specific reserve builds, are what drove the provision up 22% this quarter. Moving next to total expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis expenses increased by 3% versus the prior year in Q4 and were flat for the full year, reflecting the decision to reinvest the majority of the Concur gain in Q4, the GBT gain in Q2, partially offset by the loss of our business travel expenses in the prior year.  I\u2019ll provide more details on our marketing, and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes. To touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 12, rewards expense provide 10% in Q4 in part due to the $109 million impact from our renewed agreement with Delta on a full year basis. Rewards expense growth of 7% was relatively consistent with our reported proprietary billings growth. Also, on Slide 12, the tax rate in the quarter was 35%, slightly above what we have seen in the past couple of quarters, as it was impacted by the resolution of certain prior year items. Prior to this quarter, we had been trending at a tax rate of approximately 34%, while in any given quarter to screen items because impact the effective rate we generally think 34% is more indicative of our underlying run rate.  Moving to marketing and promotional expenses on Slide 13, as I discuss the two sizable gains we recognized in 2014 allows us to invest in a number of attractive growth opportunities and we believe this is the right decision to create value for shareholders. As a result, marketing and promotion expenses were the majority of our incremental investments and growth initiatives were recorded increased sequentially and grew 13% versus Q4 2013 and 9% on a full year basis. For the year, much of this spending focused on acquiring card members across our diverse set of card portfolios. These initiatives included acquisition efforts for our proprietary charge in lending products, as well as opportunities in the co-brand space.  Additionally, we were focused on expanding our merchant network, capturing a greater share of our card members lending, building out our GNS business and growing our newer digital business. One example how we build relationships with small businesses across local merchant network and our card member base was our support this past quarter of the small business sed rate. This initiative now takes place across six countries and is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. Turning now to operating expense performance for Q4 on Slide 14, our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel operations in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons. Additionally, the impact of our restructuring charge this quarter had substantial impact on salaries and benefits. That said, adjusting for last year\u2019s GBT operations and this year\u2019s restructuring charge, operating expenses decreased 1% in the quarter on a reported basis and increased by 1% on adjusting for FX. Turning to the full year, our adjusted operating expense growth remained well contained and came in well below on 3% growth target for the year as you can see on Slide 15. We continue to demonstrate disciplined control of our operating expenses and this marked the second consecutive year that operating expense growth was significantly below the growth target that we set, on our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. These discipline around operating expenses allow us to continue investing for growth, and provided increased financial flexibility in an economy that remains uncertain. As we look ahead, the restructuring actions that we are taking our one part, of what will allow us to remain discipline by operating expenses growth. Now shifting our focus towards capital on Slide 16, the benefits of our strong capital discipline position were on display all year, as we returned 86% of the capital generated in the year, while modestly strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As is usual, you do see our capital ratios decline slightly, sequentially during the fourth quarter, due to the seasonal increase in our loan and receivable balances. A portion of the year-over-year increase on our tier 1 capital ratio was driven by the preferred issuance we executed during the fourth quarter, and we plan to follow this with another issuance in Q1. As I discussed on the last earnings call, these issuances represents the most cost effective way to meet our evolving capital requirements and were part of the capital plan in our 2014 CCAR submission. Now we did of course complete our submissions for the 2015 CCAR process earlier this month. We expect a year back from the FET said about our submission in March. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years, while continuing to increase our capital ratios, illustrates the strength of both our balance sheet and our business model. We also worked hard to satisfy the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the sales guidelines and continue to strengthen aspects of our capital planning processes to support this critical effort. So coming back to our full year results. We are pleased with our performance in the current economic competitive environment. For the full year, we had earnings per share growth of 14%, which is within our on average and over time target, while leveraging the gains provided by the business travel joint venture and the sale of our investment in Concur will better position the company. Looking forward to 2015, we do face a number of increasing challenges including global economic growth that is forecast to remain below long-term averages, foreign exchange headwinds from a strengthening U.S. dollar, intense competition in the co-brand space, and a heightened regulatory environment particularly in the EU. Of course, many of these issues are not new. And we face these challenges from a strong position with many growth opportunities and assets that will give us a competitive advantage. We remain constant that our business model provides the opportunity to deliver significant value to our shareholders over the longer-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session.\nRick Petrino: Great, thanks Jeff. Just before we start the Q&A I do want to say that in response to feedback we have been receiving, we\u2019re going to try to provide a better opportunity for more analysts to ask a question today, so considering that I do want to ask that everyone in the queue please limiting yourself to just one question, seriously. And so thanks for your cooperation with that. And we can now turn it over and start the Q&A operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nKenneth Bruce: Thank you, good afternoon. Could you possibly give us some more details around what the benefits from the restructuring charge will be in terms of you mentioned the reduced headcount but over what period of time should we really be thinking about the net benefits from that restructuring please?\nJeffrey Campbell: That's a good question, Ken. We of course have been on a steady journey here for a number of years to continually evolve our business, how we operate, how we interact with our card members and our merchants, take advantage of evolving technologies, make sure we have the right footprint. And this is really a continuation of that strategy. Now, some of these moves are complicated and it will really take us the course of calendar 2015 to execute on pretty much all of the things that are in the restructuring charge that you see us taking in Q4. So there will be some benefits in 2015. The full run rate benefits of all the actions we\u2019re taking, however, you will see as we get into 2016. So I think as we look at the actions we\u2019re taking, we\u2019re seeing it as something that will be helpful to us in 2015 to continue the kind of strong discipline you\u2019ve seen us have on operating expenses and frankly we\u2019re also position to get some further help in 2016 incrementally as the initiatives take full effect.\nKenneth Bruce: Thank you. I\u2019ll honor the one question rule [indiscernible]\nJeffrey Campbell: Great example. \nOperator: Thank you, we\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Maybe along the same lines as well Ken was asking. Could you just talk about how we should think about the core operating efficiency ratio of the enterprise? You guys have been making a series of reengineering and restructuring or taking up a bunch of reengineering and restructuring initiatives. I would assume that that would take that core run rate lower but the last kind of update we got on that was kind of high 60s. Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: I think, Sanjay, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019re a little cautious about setting a specific target because the way we run the business evolves over time and we don\u2019t want to either set too high a target. Take advantage of all the opportunities we may have to become more efficient. And frankly, there are other times when there are things that we think can help drive long-term growth in the business that may run through various parts of our P&L and various parts of the expense structure that we think that are right things to do. We don\u2019t want to preclude ourselves from spending. So I think the way we think about it is, as you go forward and you think to put your and Ken\u2019s question together about the restructuring we\u2019re just doing. We\u2019re not setting renewal operating expense target publicly for now but you\u2019re certainly not going to see us grow above 3% and you\u2019ve seen us come in pretty flat the last two years, well below to 3% target we set. Certainly, that\u2019s been an important part of our business model, providing the opportunity to spend on the growth opportunities we have and you\u2019re going to see us, I think, very focused on continuing that discipline. I just want to be a little cautious about setting an exact operating efficiency ratio target.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Don Vendetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Vendetti: Yes, Jeff, I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on when we might hear on the Costco US deal. And if you could talk a little bit around that, how you balance what appear to be sort of lighter economics on these co-brand deals with the potential lumpiness of a loss of a deal, how you sort of think through that.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I appreciate the question. Clearly Costco is a very important and long-term partner of ours. Our U.S. relationship goes back to the 1990s. We think we've been great partners and create a lot of value for their members, our card members, and for both companies. Now, I would point out to you that I don't think we said anything about any ongoing discussions we're having with Costco. Obviously, with very important partners, we are always working every day to evolve the relationship to make it better and frankly to make sure it's working for both parties.  You can presume we're doing that with Costco as we're doing it with all of our partners at any time and if and when we have any news as we did with Delta, which we chose to renew early, we would certainly tell you. In terms of thinking about the economics of these things, you've certainly heard a number of us, both Ken and I and some of our colleagues talk about the competitive environment for co-brands in recent months and quarters and that's true.  I think you have to balance those comments with the fact that these are still one of many good economic growth opportunities we have as a Company. And while yes, the environment has become competitive and certainly there are cases where we conclude because we're pretty selective that we think we're better off not either getting into or proceeding with certain kinds of co-brand partnerships because we have so many other opportunities in our proprietary business, as a general matter these still are attractive and important parts of our overall business model and when we have great partners where our interests are really aligned and I'll go back to the recent renewals with Delta and Starwood, we think we can create great value together and for all parties involved.\nDon Vendetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sheryl Tate with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nSheryl Tate: Hi, good afternoon. Question on the - on U.S. billed business and clearly lower gas prices have been a bit of a headwind in terms of reduced spend. Just wondering if you can help think through some of the offsets as to the opportunity clearly with OptBlue and higher merchant acceptance and also if there's - if you're seeing sort of consumer willingness to increase spend in other non-gas related categories as potential offsets as well.\nJeffrey Campbell: Couple things, Sheryl. For us, gas is a relatively modest portion of spend. It's probably 3% or so or a little under 3 of our spend. If you look at the quarter it was probably down around 10%. So there's some impact on our overall billings. It's fairly modest. I think given the size of that and the context of our Company, it's probably premature or early for us to try to say whether or not there is an offset as consumers and companies take the savings, they're getting and spend elsewhere. It would probably just be hard for us to say, given the magnitude of our overall network versus what the spend on gas is. On OptBlue, we've been really pleased since we rolled the plan out early last year with the great acceptance it's gotten in the merchant acquirer world. We've been very pleased with the progress those acquirers have then made in signing up new merchants. I would just remind people that as we laid out the plan early last year, this is a multiyear effort and we are proceeding really nicely and we are right on track to make very significant strides in merchant coverage over the next couple years. There's a process of you have to expand the coverage, then you have to create awareness with card members and that's why we've always talked about this as a multiyear effort. We're really pleased by all the early signs on, but it's not something that in the fourth quarter I would have expected to have a particularly material impact on the overall billings.\nSheryl Tate: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.\nSameer Gokhale: Hi, thank you. The question I had was just around your provisions for the quarter and Jeff, you talked about that a little bit, the provision is being a little bit higher than where they've been at and you also talked about some specific provisioning there. But I'd like to get your view as far as what's going on with the underlying consumer and provisioning trends going forward because you had the lower gas prices, presumably they helped consumers a little bit. I know you target affluent consumers, so there's maybe less of a benefit. But you look at the charge-off rate improvements either the size of the provisioning, it seems like we should expect some pretty hefty growth in provisioning looking into 2015. So if you could just parse the provisioning for us a little bit and your outlook there, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: So, Sameer, gosh, when you look at our credit metrics, actually are down year-over-year and what we are seeing in write-offs and delinquencies, there's really no sign of a tick upwards. I only of course joined the Company about a year and a half ago and I think I said on every single earnings call that I've done beginning in July of 2013 that well write off rates have to eventually go up but they have not. With the provision this quarter there's really as I said three things going on. Number one, remember we're growing loans at 7%. You also just have a seasonal phenomenon because the balances always go up in the December quarter, and we do just the way the rules work, we do set the reserves up for those balances and often the pattern would be that a little bit of that would roll off as you get into the beginning of next year. We also just had a few specific reserve items, which come and go. So it's not necessarily indicative of the future going forward. And we are relative to where we were, say, a year ago, two years ago, at a point where we're not further improving the metrics much. They're fairly flat, although they are have improved a little bit. So it's really those phenomenon that drove this quarter what was a sizable increase in provision at 22% increase in provision. But I think I'd be cautious about concluding from that that all else being equal, without other changes in the environment, that you should expect a big jump-up in provision next year. We'll have to see how the economy develops. We'll have to see how our metrics develop. But certainly we don't see in our metrics any sign of the weakening consumer credit environment and gosh, when you look at unemployment rates continuing to go down, I don't think that should surprise any of us.\nSameer Gokhale: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, we\u2019ll go now to Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Go ahead please.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening. Jeff, can you talk about how the existence of the preferred debt you guys have issued, I think you did $750 million in the third quarter, better positions you for CCAR this year? And the degree to which you think of it as replacing equity, particularly since that prefers capable of absorbing losses under the severely adverse scenario.\nJeffrey Campbell: So as you - good question, Bill. I think I explained but probably not for quite some time. When you look at the evolving capital rules it used to be that the tier 1 capital minimums were actually below the Tier 1 common minimums. We moved into a world where the tier 1 capital minimums are about 150 basis points above your tier 1 common. So if you're going to try to run the company efficiently, and be governed by to your point in the severe scenario what are you going to trip, you got to find the most cost efficient way if you will to fill that 150 basis point difference between the tier 1 common and the tier 1 ratio. And the preferred is clearly for us and for many other banks. You've seen quite a surge of issuance of these kinds of securities. That's why we put it into our CCAR 2014 submission last year. It's why you will see us do another issuance in the first quarter or this quarter and that will bring us about to where we want to be to provide that 150 basis point buffer. Certainly, this is one component among several that we think makes our CCAR submission this year even stronger. We have built over the past 12 months capital even though we returned a very significant amount of capital to shareholders many we have issued this preferred. We continue to work on all of the qualitative processes which we think are getting better in providing more insights to us. So we feel really good about our submission. All that said, we're not the judge the Fed is and we'll have to see where we come out probably towards the latter part of March. \nBill Carcache: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Ball with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nBradleyBall: Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned the heightened regulatory challenges and it looks like the EU is close to finalizing its card payment fee caps. Could you talk about how these new rules will impact your business in Europe and how you plan to adjust AmEx's business there to reflect the changes in the economics of the business? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, as we've commented on for a while, we are very, very, very actively engaged of course with lots of parties across the EU in the ongoing process that will ultimately lead to a finalization of all the new rules. And I think one thing we've learned is we want to be a little bit cautious until the final, final rules are out and all the details spelled out and making any comments on the ultimate impact to us. All that said, I'd make a few general points. One, any regulation, even regulation targeted more at the two dominant networks tends to put some pressure even if it's indirect on our business model.  Two, we do have a flexible business model and the closed loop gives us some unique ability to operate in a number of ways in response to evolving, not just regulatory, but competitive and other environments and you've seen us do some of those things in other parts of the world. Sometimes it takes us some time to evolve the business model. We'll have to see where the final EU rules come out.  Three, I would say there are already some things happening in Europe that are going to have an impact on us even in the near term, even though the final payments directive has not been issued and there are some changes in the rules around cross-border acquiring that we think are already and even more so in 2015 will begin to put some pressure on our discount rate in Europe. And that's just one of the many challenges that I talked about in as I reflected overall on the challenges we have for 2015. On the broader overall impact for the payments directive, we\u2019ll just have to see what the final language shows.\nBradleyBall: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Hochstim with Buckingham reserve. Go ahead, please.\nDavid Hochstim: Thanks. I wonder since you mentioned your Starwood and Delta co-brands. Can you give us an update on how large they are as a percentage of loans and/or billed business and I guess could you expand on the negative financial impact that the renewal of those contracts might have?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, we don\u2019t, David, as you know, tend to call out the specific size of any of our portfolios and I would probably include Starwood.\nDavid Hochstim: You did several years ago provide those, so I didn\u2019t know if maybe you\u2019d be willing to update that.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, I don\u2019t think at this point. Obviously there\u2019s also sense sensitivity with our partners so it\u2019s not something David I want to do on a casual basis. You are correct, from time to time usually at an investor presentation kind of format we have provided a few numbers that we fully vet with the partners bank. So we\u2019re not prepared to do that today. Clearly the fact that we have just resigned with Starwood tells you about how pleased we are and I think how pleased they are with the relationship and the growth potential it has going forward. You talk about the impact. I guess what I was very much trying to communicate in my comments earlier is that we are in these co-brand relationships for the long term, just like we run the Company for the long term. Often, these partnerships only get renewed every quite a number of years. These are not annual renewals. So when normal market commission have evolved for quite a number of years, when you renew a contract you can sometimes have a significant reset and we always structure these things so both parties have tremendous incentives to continue to grow the value and we\u2019re pretty pleased overall with the role that all these partners have played in our financial performance over the years. So these latest renewals fall into all of those general fits of experience I just gave you. No one portfolio that\u2019s the size of star is going to have that material an impact on us, but it\u2019s one of the many, many factors we look at as we think about both our near term and our longer term financial performance.\nDavid Hochstim: Would it be reasonable to expect higher reward cost, prospectively with Delta?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, our relationship with Delta is very, very complex. You\u2019ve got a co-brand partnership. You have their participation in membership rewards. They\u2019re a very, very significant merchant for us. We have a lounge agreement with them. We are a huge - I\u2019d remind you, we are still 60% owner of the largest business travel operation in the country. So there are a lot, lot, lot of moving economic pieces to our relationship with Delta. So that's why it's such an important relationship to them. It's why it's such an important relationship to us. And that's why we think it's so important to get it back in a status where it's been renewed for the longer term and that's where we are now and now we're both just focused on growing the relationship. I don't want to comment on any specific terms in anyone of the many areas because of course we both look at this relationship and try to balance it across all the many different components.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Good afternoon. Just I was hoping to get a little bit of an update on a couple of our growth initiatives. The loyalty partners, and if that was getting to a point where it\u2019s material enough to possibly breakout for us and we've been hearing around the market that American Express is getting more active in small business lending and I was wondering if you could talk about that at all, those two growth initiatives.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, we continue to be very pleased by the growth in loyalty partner. As you recall, we launched in Italy late last year - early last year. It is well into a very mature state in a number of other countries, Germany, Mexico, et cetera. The growth rates for that business overall are in the high double-digits and we're very pleased and I think you can continue to expect us to expand to new countries. In terms of breaking it out, I think we're still a ways from that. We will probably somewhat similar to the answer I gave earlier in response to things like Starwood metrics. We will from time to time usually in an Investor Day kind of setting give people a few metrics, but we're really pleased with the business. And I think it's also fair to say we're also learning, because it is a relatively new business for us, how to better optimize some of the synergies with our core card business and we're pleased with our progress there. In fact, I talked in my earlier remarks about strong growth in a number of European countries including Germany and one of the factors helping us in Germany are some of the synergies we're beginning to see between our core card business and loyalty partner. On small business lending, we obviously have a tremendous franchise with small businesses. And we were certainly the first to create an organization within the Company extremely focused on just trying to figure out how do we help drive success across our small business partners and it's given us a tremendous position in the marketplace.  Small business Saturday has been a tremendous add to the overall range of the things we do with small business partners and growing our lending efforts in small business we would see as one of the many opportunities we have to do a little bit more lending than you've seen us do the last few years. I want to emphasize here that we're a long, long ways from doing anything that changes our spend centric focus. On the other hand, with our existing customer base, within our existing risk profile, with your example of small businesses as a really good example, we think we are really well positioned to accelerate growth rates from where we are today and we're very focused on doing it. \nBobNapoli: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Taiano with Burke & Quick. Go ahead, please.\nMichael Taiano: Great, thank you. Just want to go back to the energy question, sort of the drop in oil prices. The deceleration that you saw in billed business volume in the fourth quarter, if there was anything that was noticeable related to any of the energy - the states that are more energy centric like Texas in the fourth quarter. And then just looking forward, sort of how you plan on sort of managing sort of the credit risk of some of those states. I know back when the housing crisis that you guys were very proactive in trying to rein in credit lines for those that you thought might be more exposed to housing. Just was curious on your thoughts on that. \nJeffrey Campbell: That's a great question, Mike. I think in terms of the impact in Q4 on billings by geography, billings by industry type, as we've begun to scrub through the numbers, you really don't see anything that jumps out at you in terms of a pattern, but frankly that's not surprising to us because it's still pretty new when you think about Q4. I think we'll all have to see how things develop in 2015. I think that also really points to the importance of your second question. Believe me, as you would expect us to be, we are being very thoughtful and very focused on both industry and geographic concentrations and trying to be well ahead of anything that does start to appear in terms of how we're managing our credit profile across our business. \nMichael Taiano: Great, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Just back on the Delta, you've said that it's - I guess Delta said that they were going to double the benefits from that relationship with American Express to them as part of the new contract. Is there any way you could size, what percentage of your rewards costs relate to that both across the co-brand and the purchase of MR points?\nJeffrey Campbell: I must admit Moshe, I missed their double comment but maybe\u2026\nMoshe Orenbuch: They did an Investor Day a couple of weeks back in which they said that.\nJeffrey Campbell: But look, they're a great partner for us and as I explained earlier, we have a really broad relationship with Delta that cuts across so many parts of both our companies. It's generated tremendous value for us and it's generated tremendous value for them. We last renewed it in 2008 and it's now locked in for quite some period of time and we're really pleased with that and we're both very focused on growing the very mutual interest we have in a common card member and flier base. All that said, they're a good partner and I think we've been pretty clear that in general there's a reset often when you do these kinds of renewals after a long time and I said on my earlier remarks Delta is no exception. You do see the one piece of the economics in the charges we took in Q4. And that is that there is an impact that caused us to reprice the bank of MR points so that basically tells you we're going to pay Delta a little bit more money when a membership rewards member transfers MR points to redeem a flight on Delta. That's actually very similar to something we did back in 2008, in fact the charge is almost the same size as something we took back in 2008. So that's not new. I think it's just sort of a standard part of the reset. Beyond that, I don't want to try to size the overall economics of a specific agreement as we have with Delta and there's many, many ways that they may think about the value so I actually couldn't tell you how they might have gotten to the\nMoshe Orenbuch: So is it fair then just to add to that the fact that you've got 5% of your co-brand, of your spending volume in the co-brand because that's not part of the MR program. Right. That\u2019s a disclosure you made in the 10-K of that 5% of your spend is the Delta co-brand.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, you are correct. And of course we spell that out arises leveled from an SEC perspective we should disclose.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Got it. Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks, Moshe.\nOperator: Thank you. And next, we have James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead, please.\nJames Friedman: I want to ask you about Delta.\nJeffrey Campbell: No, Jamie, you can ask about whatever you like.\nJames Friedman: I was going to ask about GCS. I was - if you could share with us your perspective about the general competitive environment for corporate cards. And then in the sales Concur, does that change your advantage in that it\u2019s no longer a consolidated asset.\nJeffrey Campbell: Remember, our ownership stake in Concur was about 13% or so. And then back in 2008, we thought putting in place a series of operating agreements taking that minority of stake. We did put $1 billion on the board. It was really a good way to both - make sure we captured the operating synergies between the two companies and we\u2019ve been very successful over the years and helping each other to grow. Well, frankly, letting Concur operate as an independent company to really grow and create the value that - they\u2019ve really done a rather remarkable job of with the purchase by SAP. We are very excited frankly to take that partnership, longstanding partnership with Concur and continue it, but frankly expanded as they become a part of SAP and we think that\u2019s going to open even more avenues of working together and we\u2019ve - even as you would expect before the acquisition was announced, had a number of discussions along those lines. And so, we\u2019re if anything more excited than we were about the ability to continue to work together to help drive both of our businesses forward. So I think we\u2019re out of time. Operator, so I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call and participating in the Q&A. We are, to summarize, maybe pleased with the solid performance we showed for the full year of 2014. We do face increasing challenges in 2015, but we face the challenges from a strong position, many growth opportunities and we\u2019re all focused on making sure we\u2019re making the right decisions to position the company for the long-term. So with that, I wish you all good evening. Thanks for your continued interest in American Express.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to be here today to report on another solid quarter of financial results by American Express. Our performance this quarter reflected higher spending by our card members, solid growth in loan balances, credit indicators at or near historical lows, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year. Our earnings per share growth of 12% outpaced revenue growth, once again reflecting the benefits of disciplined operating expense control and our share repurchase program. We also made progress on several newer fronts this quarter attracting additional partners to our OptBlue program, acquiring new card members on our EveryDay product and participating in the upcoming Apple Pay Global Wallet launch. Also during the quarter SAP announced its proposed acquisition of Concur Technologies, which as it closes will produce a significant gain for us given our long-standing ownership position in and operating partnership with Concur. I'll discuss each of these items in further detail later on the call. Stepping back a bit. On a year-to-date basis we have been able to drive strong EPS growth within our 12% to 15% long-term target range despite having adjusted revenue growth remain below our long-term targets at approximately 5%. As we have shown over the last two years, the different levers we have to drive earnings performance in a relatively slow growth environment have been a huge asset. We are beginning to see some modest acceleration in our volumes but revenue is not yet growing as fast as we and I suspect you, would like to see. Our challenge will be to continue to deliver in an environment that may be characterized by modest global economic growth and more intense competition. While this quarter did not include the many significant items related to the business travel joint venture that complicated our Q2 results, it is the first quarter that business travel was not consolidated within our P&L. You will notice that this change particularly impacts the year-over-year comparisons for both our revenue and expense lines which I'll discuss in further detail as we review the results. To help you reconcile these impacts, I would point you to annex 6 at the back of our slide presentation which provides the historical P&L performance of business travel by quarter. Now turning to our summary financial performance on Slide 2. FX adjusted billed business growth increased slightly to 10% during the current quarter including some acceleration in international markets. Reported revenue was flat to last year but was up 5% if you adjust for business travel and it rounds to 6% when you also adjust for FX, given the strengthening dollar we saw as the quarter progressed. Pretax income rose by 12% during the quarter while net income was only up 8% due to the lower tax rate we experienced last year. In contrast to this year-over-year tax challenge, helping our EPS is the fact that over the last four quarters we have repurchased $4 billion of common shares. This translated into a 3% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. Altogether, these factors drove diluted EPS of $1.40 which is 12% higher than the prior year. I will note that these quarterly results do include some ongoing transition expenses related to the business travel joint venture. Although this impact was partially offset this quarter by a small gain related to the transaction that was not realized until this quarter. These results also brought our return on equity for the period ended September 30 to 29%, well above are on average and over time target of 25%. Now turning to a more detailed review of our key performance metrics, I'll begin with billed business on Slide 3. Billed business growth increased to 10% on an FX adjusted basis versus 9% in Q2. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar that is of course impacting many companies this quarter, billed business growth on a reported basis remain consistent with the prior quarter at 9%. In the U.S., total billings growth improved by 80 basis points versus the prior quarter but the overall rate still rounded to 9%. U.S. corporate and small business is spending both accelerated and had double-digit growth rates during the quarter. Outside the U.S. our volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company. Billed business growth increased to 11% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, up from 9% of quarter. The improvement was primarily seen in the JAPA region where volume growth was 16% this quarter. We continued to see very strong volumes in China and also saw improved growth in Australia and Korea. Moving to billed business by segment on Slide 4. GNS continues to be our fastest growth segment with volumes increasing by 17% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis. The strong performance in GNS was primarily driven by the growth in China and Korea that I just mentioned. I would also remind you that the marginal contribution from each dollar of GNS billings can differ significantly by international markets. For example, all foreign payment players currently operate at little to no margin on spending in China. But for longer-term strategic reasons, China is clearly a market we will remain focused on and we are pleased with the presence we are building there. Moving to Slide 5. Loan growth remains consistent with last quarter and was up 5% versus last year on a worldwide basis and 6% in the U.S. Our loan growth continues to outpace the industry with the differential remaining relatively constant as industry loan growth has also improved recently. We are continuously focused on spend growth while also accommodating our customers borrowing needs. As part of our initiatives to have the American Express brand to become ever more welcoming and inclusive, we are reaching out to a broader demographic of potential customers. For some of these new card members, the ability to revolve a balance may be a more significant consideration. Importantly, we think we can attract these new customers without significantly changing the overall credit profile of the company. Our new EveryDay product is an excellent example of this strategy. The product is focused on driving every day spending behavior while providing the ability to revolve a balance if needed. We are not changing our credit standards for EveryDay. These customers would generally have qualified for our products but did not believe we had a card that met their needs. It's still early days for the EveryDay product but it has performed better than our initial expectations since its launch earlier this year. Moving to our P&L performance on Slide 6. As you mentioned, reported revenue growth was impacted by the business travel joint venture. Excluding business travel revenue from prior year results, Q3 adjusted revenue growth was 5%. As you would expect given our spend centric model, this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher billed business volumes. We did see billed business growth exceed discount revenue growth by a bit more than in recent quarters. This was driven in part by our lower discount rate which was down 3 basis points versus the prior year and continues to be driven in part by our ongoing mix shift in volumes towards more retail and every day spend which tend to have lower discount rates. We are also beginning to see a modest impact on the discount rate related to the OptBlue program. During the quarter we made excellent progress adding new OptBlue partners including Wells Fargo, Elavon and TSYS. At this point, eight of the top ten U.S. merchant acquirers are now part of the program. OptBlue merchant acquirers are actively signing new merchants onto the American Express network. This has resulted in some modest incremental pressure on the discount rate. But I would remind you that a portion of this impact is offset through reduced operating expenses as we eliminate some of the various incentives we previously paid to the acquirers and the OptBlue merchant acquirers assume both servicing and credit responsibilities. We continue to believe that OptBlue will bring incremental volumes onto our network and provide attractive economics for our business. Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was the accelerated growth of our GNS business, where we share the discount revenue we earn from merchants with our issuing bank partners. Last, faster growth in contra revenue items including corporate client incentives and strong growth in our cash rebate rewards products, also contributed to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth. Turning to other revenue lines. Net interest income was the other primary driver of revenue growth. Growing 9% as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an increase in average loan balances. Finally, as expected, travel commissions and fees declined significantly this quarter as the revenues associated with business travel were no longer consolidated in our P&L. Turning now to credit performance on Side 7. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain near or at historically low levels. Worldwide lending write-off rates declined further during the quarter to 1.5% while delinquency rates remained relatively constant with recent periods at 1.1%. As a reminder, our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore at some point we would expect that write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels. Slide 8 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. Coverage levels were relatively consistent with prior periods. We believe the remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. On Slide 9, you can see that the total amount of provision has been very consistent over the past several quarters. The fact that our overall credit performance has become more stable and our loan portfolio is growing, resulted in a smaller reserve release this quarter than a year ago which was the primary driver of the 16% year-over-year increase in provision. Moving next to total expenses on Slide 10. On a reported basis expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, total expenses increased by 1%. As you can see, operating expenses were down 11%. But this reported growth rate benefited, of course, from the impact of the business travel joint venture. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, operating expenses were flat to 2013. Clearly, maintaining disciplined control of our expenses, particularly operating expenses, remains a key driver behind our earnings growth. I will come back to operating expenses and to the marketing and promotion line where expenses were relatively consistent with last year, in a few minutes. To touch first, however, on a few other items on Slide 10. Rewards expense grew by 5% which was slightly lower than reported billed business growth. We would not usually expect rewards to grow at a slower rate than proprietary billings as this quarter's results were impacted by the true up of certain rewards related reserves. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 34.2% which is higher than the 31.8% rate that we experienced during the third quarter of 2013 but in line with our prior expectation that our tax rate for 2014 could be closer to the mid-30s. To return now to our efforts to grow the business through marketing and promotion. Slide 11 shows that these expenses were $809 million this quarter and around similar to the levels seen in the second half of last year. As expected, these expenses are down sequentially versus Q2 since marketing and promotion was higher during Q2 as we reinvested a substantial portion of the gain from the business travel joint venture transaction in growth initiatives. We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our core businesses and from newer initiatives. Looking forward, you will likely see an increase in marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 due to the dynamics associated with our investment in Concur. So let me provide you with some background about our relationship with Concur. Back in 2008, we entered into an operating agreement with and made a strategic investment in Concur. The relationship enables us to offer corporate customers an integrated system to make their expense and business travel reporting easier. Importantly, it also provides Concur with the opportunity to significantly grow the scale of their business. Our relationship has been highly successful and has created significant value for our shareholders. During September, SAP announced that they would be acquiring Concur in a deal that valued the company at $129 per share. If this proposed transaction is completed, it would result in a sizable gain for American Express of approximately $700 million. Currently, Concur and SAP's public expectation is that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2015. Our operating agreements with Concur will continue after the transaction is completed and we look forward to partnering with both Concur and SAP in the future. Given that the proposed Concur acquisition was just announced a few weeks ago, we are still in the process of determining exactly how we can best utilize the gain from the transaction. But looking forward, as we have done with similar items in the past, we do plan to leverage the favorable impact from the gain to invest in business building activities and initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies. Potential growth initiatives could include incremental customer acquisition activities across our core businesses as well as investments to strengthen partner relationships. In line with our evolving customer and business needs, we would also likely fund initiatives designed to improve our efficiency and contain operating expenses going forward. These investments will provide valuable flexibility to deal proactively with the global regulatory and competitive environment that is rapidly changing, particularly in economies that may continue to grow at only a modest pace. Turning now to our operating expense performance on Slide 12. As I mentioned, operating expenses were down 11% on a reported basis and were flat versus last year when excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year. The results clearly demonstrate that disciplined control of operating expenses remains a top priority for us and we continue to seek ways to increase the efficiency of our organization. The impact of business travel varied somewhat by operating expense line. While the majority of the prior year expenses were within salaries and benefits, the impact is sufficiently spread across all expense categories such that line-by-line comparisons are difficult. I'll also note that operating expenses in the current year include a small amount of ongoing transition another expenses related to the joint venture. We have an agreement with the joint venture whereby they reimburse us a portion of these expenses as business travel transitions to its new operating structure. These reimbursements are recorded within other revenue. On a year to date basis, operating expenses remain well-controlled and on an adjusted basis are flat to 2013 as shown on Slide 13. I'll remind you that while our annual target was for operating expenses to grow by less than 3% during 2014, our year-to-date performance suggests we are on track to come in well below that. We also continue to achieve our reengineering and cost targets while not just maintaining but actually improving the level of service provided to our customers. As a result of these improvements, customer service remained a key competitive differentiator for American Express. Now let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant flexibility, as shown on Slide 14. This quarter we were able to return 89% of the capital we generated to shareholders while also maintaining our strong capital ratios. Turning than to Slide 15, which shows the impact of Basel III on several minimum capital ratios. As you know, under Basel I the minimum threshold for the tier 1 ratio was 100 basis points lower than that for the minimum tier 1 common ratio. As a result, for American Express the tier 1 ratio historically has never been a binding constant in our capital planning. But as you also know, the requirement for the tier 1 ratio under Basel III is now 150 basis points higher than the common equity tier 1 ratio. Given this relationship, we believe that our capital structure should ultimately include eligible preferred to fund this 150 basis point differential. When you look across the industry, you see that a majority of large financial institutions have included preferred stock in the non-common tier 1 component of their capital structures. Most importantly, the Fed has started using these new minimums to assess capital adequacy and approve capital actions in the CCAR process. As a result of all these changes, or 2014 CCAR submission included the planned issuance of some preferred shares. We anticipate that this issuance will occur over the next two quarters subject to market conditions. Looking forward, we continue to plan for a 2015 CCAR submission and remain committed to maintaining our strong capital position while leveraging that strength to create value for our shareholders. I will also note that we just entered into parallel run under the Basel III advance approaches in Q1 and it is too early for us to provide a reliable estimate of its ultimate impact on our capital ratios. As you know, the advanced approaches rules are highly complex and we continue to work with our regulators to clarify certain aspects of these rules. Leaving capital than let me provide an update on a few other items before concluding. First, the highly speculated upon launch of an Apple Mobile Wallet occurred this quarter with the rollout of Apple Pay which Apple expects to go live later this month. We are participating in the wallet because we want to be everywhere our customers are and millions of them are devoted Apple users. The mobile wallets have had the potential to change consumer behavior for some years but it's unlikely to be an overnight shot. It will take time even with Apple's innovative technology and customer base. The pace of consumer and merchant adoption will depend on the benefits, protection and overall value proposition that participating issuers and networks can provide. That plays to our strength. With Apple Pay we are keeping our closed loop advantage intact and the retaining direct relationships with card members and merchants. In addition, the capabilities that we will be integrating into Apple Pay are a foundation that can be used to fuel our growth in mobile payments more broadly in the longer-term. Next, I wanted to touch on the pending loss of our relationship with Costco in Canada. While we are disappointed that we will longer continue this partnership in Canada, we are excited about the launch of our new cash back product in the Canadian market and are focused on retaining many of our customers. I will note that we have separate agreements with Costco in each of the several markets where we maintain a partnership and have a longer and more significant relationship with Costco in the U.S. dating back over 15 years. As with any long-term partnership, we work with Costco on an ongoing basis to find ways to drive value for both parties going forward, never losing sight of the fact that we are serving the same customers. Many of you are aware the environment for co-branded products has become increasingly competitive. From our side, we remain focused on developing attractive value propositions for our card members and co-brand partners that still drive strong economics for our shareholders. Finally, as you are aware, our trial with the DoJ concluded last week when both sides presented their closing arguments. We are now waiting for the judge to issue his decision, which could take several months or longer to complete. There will then be a lengthy appeals process in all likelihood as either side has the right to appeal. Much as we would like to, I don't think it's appropriate or beneficial for us to speculate or offer any color commentary on any of the specific testimony. We believe that our legal defense is a strong but ultimately that will be up to the courts to decide. So in summary. Coming back to results we feel good about our overall performance in the current economic environment. Revenue growth adjusted for the impact of the business travel joint venture and FX increased to 6% reflecting the growth we saw in billings and loans this quarter. This revenue growth combined with historically low credit metrics, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong capital position, allowed us to generate strong growth in EPS. So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we can ensure with you as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: A couple of questions. One is on the discount rate and the different programs. You did a great job of outlining the puts and takes on what's driving the discount rate down broadly, and then talked through how those programs also drive down lower operating expenses. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of, all in, where the pretax margin goes, including not only the discount rate side but the operating expense side as a total package.\nJeff Campbell: So if you go back, Betsy, to when we first talked about the economics of OptBlue which I believe was at the financial community meeting in February. We pointed out that, you are correct, there is a partial offset to the decline in discount rate because certain other payments we have been making to the merchant acquirers which run through operating expenses we would no longer be making. Now that is not a complete offset, it's a partial offset. Our strong belief in the overall positive economics of the OptBlue program depend upon our belief that with expended merchant coverage, and over the course of the next several years we believe this program in the U.S. has the ability to make significant strides in the remaining merchant coverage gap we have. We believe that that will have very strong overall billings and revenue impacts that will more than offset the remaining negative impact on the margin when you just offset the discount rate decline on existing business versus the saving payments to the merchant acquirers. That will take time as merchant coverage grows and as our customers begin to learn and understand that it grows. But I would say we are really pleased with the progress we have made with the merchant acquiring community and are very bullish about the long-term prospects for the program.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks. And then separately follow-up question, separate topic on preferred. You indicated the 1.5 percentage point gap that you might be taking advantage of with preferred issuance, indicated over the next couple of quarters. But maybe you could give us a sense as to how much over the next couple of quarters. I'm wondering if you are intimating that you would fill that entire 150 basis point gap in that period or if that's over a longer period of time?\nJeff Campbell: I think our view, and of course some of this will depend a little bit, Betsy, on market conditions. But sitting here today, our view is we will probably begin to fill the gap. And, of course, the way the CCAR process works as you know, we are committed to filling a portion of the gap that we put in our CCAR 2014 submission. But it would not take us all the way to filling the entire gap. We do believe in the long run, given the way the rules work, that the right, permanent long-term capital structure will eventually get us to that level. We probably won't get there with the first couple of issuances. I would also point out that, I don't want to drag everyone throughout the map, but it's a fairly complex calculation because what you really focus on is getting to that 150 basis points in a stress scenario through the CCAR process, because that's really where it would potentially become a binding constraint for us.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Right. So this should be over several, more than a handful of quarters, I would expect.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. I don't want to speculate on just how many quarters because, again, it's tricky always to predict market dynamics and we will also be making some calls about how the market for these securities evolves and how the overall market evolves, particularly considering today's events. But it will certainly take more than the two quarters that we talked about in my prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: I guess I wanted to go back to your opening comments on revenue growth not being in line with your long-term targets for a bit. And I was wondering what sort of initiatives or plans you have to get that going some. I guess one area that could I think of is some of these investments that you have made or reinvestments of the gains you have made, what is the payback time period? How do we assess whether or not the efficacy of those dollars are working? And I guess second question, just on the macro picture. Obviously it's a point of debate across the markets, and I was just wondering if you have seen any discernible trends this month specifically because just the magnitude of deterioration has been fairly significant. Also maybe tie in any travel related impacts that you might see because of the virus? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me try to take those kind of one at a time, Sanjay, and I would start with your revenue growth questions. And I think I would preface my remarks by saying, we have a number of long-term targets. We have a EPS target in the 12% to 15% range, a return on equity 25% or better and revenue growth at 8% or above. Certainly our number one focus as we think about those targets is achieving the kind of very consistent EPS growth that you have seen us create quite a good track record of over the last few years. And when we think of the 8% revenue growth target, that is a facilitating lever to help us achieve those EPS targets. But one of the things that we began to talk about a few years ago and that I think we have really demonstrated over the last few years, is we have other levers to use in varied economic environments to get to our 12% to 15% EPS target even when we can't get to the revenue environment we would like. So when you say what would we do to continue to get revenue up, well, we think about investments across the short, medium and long-term horizon. And of course we could probably get the revenue growth up in the near-term higher than it is today if we abandon some of the things we're doing that we think are quite important for the longer-term. And two of the things you have heard us talk a lot about in the last couple of years are loyalty partner and loyalty coalition investments, along with the things we're doing in the reloadable prepaid markets. We continue to believe in those long-term investments but they are not in the near-term going to return as strong or as high a return as what you would get if we plow the funds we put in to those products into our core businesses. We think we have the balance about right although there is an art to it and in many ways we would suggest that the bottom line test is, are we hitting the EPS targets given where revenue growth is. And also just to remind you that for our business the real correlation is with year-over-year GDP growth. We went into this year with the consensus forecast in the U.S. for GDP growth to approach 3%. The latest consensus is down at about 2.2% year-over-year for all of 2014, and it's anyone's judgment who is listening to this call what events of recent days might mean even to that number. So we are actually pretty pleased with our EPS performance given that environment. And we are quite committed to the balanced approach we take across thinking about our spending and investments in terms of short term, medium term and long-term investments. The last comment I would make is when you think about an event like the June quarter increase in our investment spending. I think you have to put it into a little bit of perspective. We talked on last quarter's call about doing perhaps an incremental $300 million or so of marketing and promotion. I would remind you that we spend over the course of the year $3 billion to $3.5 billion of marketing and promotion. So when you think about that increment over the course of the year, it's a fairly modest increment. For the portion of that spending that is targeted at near term initiatives, you would expect to see the results as you get into the second, third and fourth quarters subsequent to the spend and we're pretty pleased with what we have seen thus far. But it's a fairly modest component of the overall spend. To go into your last question on macro trends. In general we don't like to comment a lot on intra-quarter billing trends because there tends to be a fair amount of volatility just depending on day of week, when holidays fall etc. So I wouldn't comment on that. And in terms of recent events, I think it's just too early for us to say what will happen to either billing or travel related bookings given all the media news of the last few days.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: The first question is on Apple Pay. Can you comment on whether you had to make any concessions around the discount rate to be included and also just contextualize how the role there fits in to your broader strategy to build your own proprietary mobile wallet?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I don't think, Mark, that anyone is likely to comment on any of the contract terms here. I would point out, we don't really comment on contract terms with any of our partners. More broadly our philosophy is, we want to be everywhere that our card members want to be. And there is a real affinity between the Apple brand and what it means in our card member base. So we are very excited to be a part of this launch. We think it fits very well with our brand and card member value proposition and as we have said for a long time, form factor is not particularly important to us. We have tremendous share in online products, we have a tremendous partnership with someone like Uber where, of course, you don't see any physical card presence and it really takes advantage of some of our unique digital and customer capabilities. The closed loop gives us an ability to, in Apple Pay and in any other digital setting, do some things for both the card members and the merchants that are challenging for others to emulate. So we are very excited about being part of this launch and think over time it can really be helpful in the continuing trend towards less use of cash and more use of card payments. And that's a very good thing for us and, frankly, a very good thing for the industry.\nMark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Okay, great. Next question is just a follow-up on the timing of the preferred issuance. Was the Fed essentially forcing you to trap capital here, kind of leaving you at ratios well above the longer-term economic capital targets? Why issue now instead of later when you are closer to being able to get to levels that are consistent with your long-term targets?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the short answer, of course, is we are issuing now because we committed to issuance in our CCAR submission. The longer answer for why we put it in the CCAR submission is that when you think about our capital constraints, you do have to consider them in the context of the stress scenarios that the Fed runs which can produce very very different results from what you may see when you look at our balance sheet. And the judgment we made is we submitted CCAR, our CCAR submission in 2014, was that the most prudent route to ensure that we continue to do the kinds of very aggressive returns of capital to our shareholders that we have been doing. And I would remind you that are -- we have been amongst the highest of any of the CCAR banks in terms of the amount of capital that we have been returning. The way to ensure we could continue to have a strong platform to do that given the evolution in the rules, given the way the process works, best way to do that was to put a portion of preferred into our capital structure. And that's what we committed to and therefore the will see us execute. As I said in answer to Betsy earlier, you won't see us get all the way up to the full level until some later point in time. But what our judgment was, it's prudent to begin that process now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: The first thing I just wanted to go back to was the effect or the impact of OptBlue on your discount rate. And specifically, what I was curious about is, it was a meaningful enough impact for you to call it out and you have a 3 basis point decline year-over-year in your discount rate overall. So that seems to suggest that in a short period of time there has been a lot of uptake in terms of the amount of volume coming through your OptBlue partners. So am I thinking of that incorrectly because on a proportional basis, I need to work out the exact math, but it does seem like it probably had a significant impact in a relatively short period of time. So could you help us size that a little bit in terms of maybe volume coming through your OptBlue partners or merchants incrementally that have signed up, etcetera?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think it's a still very early days for the program. And I would remind you that there is really two aspects to this. One is, that we will get expanded merchant coverage over time as the acquirers go out and find merchants who do not take American Express today and are very attracted to a simple product offering that gives them the ability to expand the range of customers they can reach. Those acquirers will also take some of their existing customer base and put them on these simpler, and we think more attractive, OptBlue program. And so there is a mixture of both of those things going on right now. And the expansion in the spending at the new merchants will take some time because our card members will take some time to even realize when merchants get added and what the benefits are of that expanded coverage. So for all of those reasons we are quite comfortable, in fact quite pleased, with the early days of the program. And the fact that the acquirers have been signing on a little quicker than we expected, is why the modest impact has hit us a little bit more quickly than we had in our plan. We actually see that as a good thing, however.\nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Okay, thank you. And then just another question I had, and I am not sure if this is something you have tracked recently. But I know in the past, Ken has talked about the migration up-market in terms of more premium cards or the movement between card products as an indicator of what's going on with the underlying consumer that you are targeting. So I was curious if that's something you have looked at recently to look at migration upwards or downwards to give you a reading on what's going on with the health of consumers. Are we seeing a slowdown in the improvement or any sort of read throughs from that? I was just curious if you had any more recent data?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think the short answer is, of course we look very closely at all the trends across all of the many products. And one of the hallmarks I think of our business model is that we strongly believe that we have a broad range of products because we want to have the right product for the right card member and people have very very different needs. Well, I'll tell you, when we look across our portfolio now, we see some very strong performance in some of our premium products. We are very pleased, and in fact have exceeded our expectations on the take-up with our new EveryDay card which is clearly targeted at a very different demographic, customers who value the revolve feature. As you mentioned in my script, you see some of our cash back rewards for our products growing particularly strongly right now and that contributes a little bit to some of the difference between billed business growth and discount revenue growth. So when you look across our portfolio, there is no particular trends that we can point you to that show migration patterns that are different than what we have experienced historically.\nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. And I know I have exceeded my quota, but just a quick last one. The Concur gain this quarter, did you quantify how much that was that flowed through your income statement?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so remember SAP hopes or expects that the transaction will close in the fourth quarter and we would expect that it will generate a gain for us of about $700 million.\nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Okay. Because I thought in one of the, in the supplement it talked about some small gain flowing through this quarter as well. So maybe [through it] (ph)?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. So as you know we have for many years have been selling off at a modest pace very large gains we generated some years back from our investment in ICBC, the Chinese bank. The sale of those shares came to an end in the September quarter and we are now completely sold out on that position. We have been considering a range of alternatives as we reached an end of that ICBC investment sale, one of which was to begin to sell modest bits of Concur. That plan was beginning to be executed and thought about and SAP came along and changed our trajectory. So there is really nothing more than that going on with a very modest sales that you see referenced in the document.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: I apologize for going back again to the capital question with the preferred, but I'm trying to make sure that I understand the reason for including the preferred issuance in your CCAR submission. So from an academic perspective, I get that it makes sense to fill that 150 basis point gap between total capital and common equity tier 1 minimums under Basel III. But in reality I thought of CCAR as the real binding constraint for most card issuers, given that losses tend to be quite high for unsecured credit card loans under a severely adverse scenario. And so if you have to run at, call it 12% common equity tier 1 levels for CCAR purposes, haven't you already filled the preferred bucket with common equity and so what's the benefit of the preferred? Maybe if you could just speak to that, it would be very helpful.\nJeff Campbell: So that's exactly the right question, Bill. The thing you have to remember is, your binding constraint in CCAR is whatever your absolute low point is over and nine quarter period. So in CCAR 2014 you were running into 2015 when the new minimums come into effect. You are running a severe stress scenario where the Fed does the modeling and you are sustaining your capital payouts. So one of the realities for us as a bank which has made very aggressive requests for share repurchase along with dividends. That means when you sustain those right through a severe stress scenario, particularly when you have a company like American Express, which if you look at our payouts lately, we're paying out over 25% of our regulatory capital base each year. The math quickly takes you from what on the surface looks like a very highly capitalized company, and we of course believe we are very highly and well-capitalized, to one that actually begins to in that severely stress scenario where you, I might suggest, unrealistically sustain your capital payouts right through that severely stress scenario, you begin to approach those minimums. And as we thought about how do we make sure we don't trip those minimums, our choice was fill it with more common or fill it with some preferred. And we clearly chose to fill it for our shareholders with preferred because it's more economic buffer.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: I see. That's very helpful. Thank you. Separately, as you discussed earlier, you guys have been able to, despite a lackluster growth environment, deliver EPS growth at the low end of your on average and over time target range by pulling on all the levers that you have available to you. And I guess when we pull together all of the comments that you have made on that issue tonight, is it reasonable to take away from that, that you continue to have confidence in your ability to generate results that are in line with at least the low end of your on average and over time target? Even if it's just at the lower end of that range?\nJeff Campbell: I think what you should take away from all of my comments is that our track record, we are using the range of levers we have to meet our EPS targets are pretty good. Our track record is very good and we have a lot of levers. And our job and our focus is on using all the levers we have to continue to achieve that kind of performance. It is more challenging in a modest economic growth environment where everything from the capital rules to the regulatory environment to the competitive environment just gets tougher every day, but that's our job. That's what you pay us to do. And we are committed to using every lever we have to stay focused on meeting those EPS targets.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: One of the important ingredients in being able to do that has been the positive operating leverage. And I think your commitment to keeping operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year has given really the market a lot of confidence in your ability to generate that positive operating leverage. Is that something that would you be willing to consider extending that beyond this year? And that was my last question.\nJeff Campbell: So we are not -- we are in the middle of our planning process right now for 2015, and so we are certainly not ready on this call to talk about what our targets are on operating expense going forward. But I would make a few obvious comments which is, we are in a business where we get some benefits from scale as our company continues to grow. And while I was calling our 5% revenue growth quite accurately less then we and probably you had hoped for, I would remind you that for a company of our size to have revenue growth in a 2% growth economy of 5% is actually, if you look at other industries, is not a bad number. That gives us the benefit of scale which is a helpful thing as we try to control operating expenses as we continue to grow. And we are also in businesses where technology helps us every year find new ways to be more efficient and where the behavior of our merchants and our card members every year is more and more about us finding ways to engage them digitally. Quite frankly, that's also a less expensive and more efficient way for us to engage with them. So we are not ready to give targets yet on expenses for next year but what we are ready to say, is we are very committed to using all the levers that are at disposal to meet our financial targets. And we have some natural advantages given our growth and our business model in finding ways to continually control operating expenses and get that very important operating leverage that you talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna: I will just ask my two upfront, Jeff, to respect the constraints of the call. So first one is housekeeping. The salary and employee benefits, this is Slide 12, at $1.29 billion. Is that a good run rate moving forward for the rest of the year? Obviously, there's been a lot of movement in that. That's my first question. And my second question is, a couple of the networks, MasterCard and Visa, have introduced fees related to tokenization. You guys were there at the authoring of tokenization. My question about tokenization is, do you have a revenue model associated with that? So the first one is about salaries, the second is about tokens. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me maybe work those in backward order here. We are constantly looking at ways to add value through innovation, technology, scale or closed loop. We are constantly looking to find ways using all of those tools, add value to our merchants. Frankly, we also expect when we find ways to add value that there will be reasonable compensation. Now that's a very general statement and we will have to see on any particular subject, I don't want to comment on tokenization in particular, where the market goes and what kind of value we can deliver to our partners. But certainly our general view is that we add value in a lot of ways and we should get compensated for it. On the salary and benefit point, there is always some quarter to quarter volatility so I'm going to be a little cautious on giving you a line item specific bit of guidance. I would make the point that salary and benefits are half or a little more of our overall operating expense. We are very committed to maintaining the trends you have seen thus far. And while you can't maintain the trends you have seen over the last few years without maintaining a very tight control around all of our employee related costs. I just want to point out that you do get a little bit of quarter to quarter volatility, sometimes particularly in the fourth quarter as you true up things at your end.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna: Thank you. \nJeff Campbell: So, operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And that will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research: I wonder if you could talk for a minute about the potential impact on billed business and maybe revenues from the decline in gas prices we've seen and the further step-down in the value of a couple of currencies that you're exposed to late in the third quarter and as we've moved into the fourth quarter?\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me maybe work those in reverse order. On the currency side, we actually, if you go back to Q1, we put a slide into our earnings call deck to help people understand a little bit which currencies we have significant exposure to. And I would also remind you even on that slide we have exposure at the revenue and billings line, there is some natural hedges to that because in many of the countries where we have the largest billings and revenue exposure, we also have just substantial operations. And so those provide some level of natural hedge. When you look at the range of currencies that matter for us, it's also a general truism that you seldom find all of those currencies moving in the same direction. Even if you look at our third quarter, the UK is a very significant country for us but it was actually fairly flat versus the U.S. dollar versus some of the other currencies. So this is a headwind for us. I would say it's generally a modest and manageable headwind unless we see an almost unprecedented across the board strengthening of the dollar. And given the events of the last few days I certainly wouldn't want to say that won't happen, but in general it's a manageable effect for us. In terms of gas, obviously our gas sales in terms of our overall business are not particularly material part of our billed business. I would just make the obvious point that for many other things in our economy that people to spend more money on, lower gas prices are generally a good thing. I guess I am an ex-airline CFO, so lower gas prices are generally really good thing to travel. But, boy, you certainly have some pretty tough to read challenging counter trends on travel right now when you look at all the news about turmoil in the world and Ebola. So it's hard to know how all that will play out. And so we will just remain committed to using all the levers we have to manage through whatever the economic environment brings for us. So I'd like to thank everybody for joining tonight's call and participating in the Q&A session. I'm going to wish you all a good evening but I'm going to turn it back over to Rick Petrino who will provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the fourth quarter. Rick?\nRick Petrino: Thanks, Jeff. So as part of our commitment to provide investors with exposure to company's management, our executives plan to speak at several events in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead through the balance of 2014, Jeff plans to speak at the Merrill Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference in New York on November 13. In addition, Ken Chenault plans to participate in two upcoming conferences. The first will be in Las Vegas on November 4 as part of the Money 2020 Conference and the second will be also in New York on December 10 for the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference. Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the public through the American Express IR Web site at ir.americanexpress.com. Thanks again for joining tonight's call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.\nOperator: Thank you.

Today\u2019s discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be on the call this afternoon to discuss another good quarterly performance by American Express. As you know, we are holding this call a little later than usual this quarter due to the complexity of the Business Travel joint venture transaction which closed on the last day of the second quarter. The gain resulting from the creation of the joint venture and the related incremental investments impacted our reported results across a number of P&L lines this quarter. We\u2019ll walk you through these impacts in just a few minutes to provide a better understanding of our underlying performance. Overall, we are pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance as the momentum seen at the end of the first quarter continued into Q2. We believe that our underlying operating performance continues to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of our business model and you will recognize some familiar themes in the quarter including higher spending by our card members, modest growth in the long portfolio, credit indicators at or near historical lows, disciplined control of operating expenses and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the past year. You will also see some significant and largely offsetting items related to our Business Travel joint venture. I\u2019ll come back to each of the moving pieces in a moment, but our bottom line came to $1.43 earnings per share on a fully diluted basis. To begin, I\u2019ll read the financial results for Q2. As you can see on Slide 2, card members spending build business growth up 9% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis year-over-year. These growth rates represent a modest acceleration versus Q1 with the improvement seen predominantly in the U.S. While volume improved 3 points overall versus last quarter, we saw a smaller increase in reported revenue growth which increased to 5% during the current quarter from 4% in Q1. I\u2019ll discuss the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes. Pre-tax income rose 16% during the quarter while net income grew 9%. This net income growth rate was lower than the 16% growth in the pre-tax income due to the unusually low tax rate we benefited from during the second quarter of last year. Over the last four quarters, we have repurchased $3.9 billion of common shares. That translated into a 4% decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then helped to drive diluted EPS to the $1.43 I mentioned a moment ago which was 13% higher than the prior on a reported basis. These results also brought our ROE for the period ending June 30th to 29%, above our on average and overtime target of 25%. So now to provide context for these overall results, let\u2019s review the gain from the creation of the Business Travel joint venture and the related incremental investments. As a reminder, American Express and an outside investor group each have a 50% ownership interest in the new joint venture. Our partners invested $900 million of cash into the joint venture while we contributed the assets of our Business Travel operations. We will continue to have a close working relationship with the joint venture. We believe that the additional resources provided by the new investor group will supports to develop products, create capabilities and attract new customers. On Slide 3, you can see that the closing of the joint venture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $626 million, in line with the estimates we provided you earlier this year. We incurred associated transaction related cost of $79 million. And I would note that we will incur a modest amount of transaction related cost in the next several quarters. As we first began to discuss at the beginning of this year, we used a substantial portion of the gain to fund incremental initiatives to better position the company for the future. First, the gain gave us the flexibility to absorb $133 million in restricting costs as we continue to focus on further increasing the overall efficiency of our organization, in line with the evolving nature of our customer and business needs. Second, we made an incremental contribution of $40 million to the AXP Foundation to support our future philanthropic activities. Last and most significantly, we step upped our investments in support of many growth initiatives. There\u2019s obviously some subjectivity involved in determining just what was incremental. As you can see on the slide, it was a significant amount. These investments were primarily in marketing and promotion, although, there were smaller amounts in a number of other P&L lines including operating expenses. These investments primarily consisted of media spending to support some of our newer products such as Amex EveryDay and Serve in the U.S. as well as incremental customer acquisition activities around the world. I\u2019ll provide more detail when we review our quarterly expense performance in a few minutes. Overall, we estimate that the total impact of the Business Travel joint venture this quarter after netting out all of these items was a small net benefit of approximately $0.05 to quarterly EPS. Let\u2019s turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 4. Total company billings growth increased from 6% in Q1 to 9% on Q2 on a reported basis and from 7% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis. Moving to Slide 5, which shows the billing trends by region, you can see that the accelerated growth was seen predominantly in the U.S. for our consumer, small business and corporate volumes all accelerated from the lower levels we saw in the first quarter. As you might remember, we mentioned that U.S. billings growth improved during the second half of Q1 and we saw that momentum continue during the second quarter. Overall, international billings growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter declining slightly to 9% in Q2 versus 10% in Q 1 on an FX adjusted basis. We did see a decline in growth rates in the JAPA region driven primarily by slower growth in China as we laughed at the rollout of new partners and products by our GNS partners during the prior year. We also saw slower growth in Australia, consistent with an overall slowdown in industry credit card volumes seen in the country during Q2. Turning to build business by segment on Slide 6, you can see that the moderation in volume growth in China and Australia also had an impact on GNS performance during the quarter. Our GNS remained our fastest growth segment in terms of billings, up 13% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Moving on to loans, the second key revenue driver. We see on Slide 7 that loan balances grew 5% globally. U.S. loans were up 6% from a year ago and continue to outpace the industry. Both of these growth rates improved by 200 basis points versus the prior quarter. It\u2019s probably worth noting that our loan growth continues to come primarily from greater spending by our card members and is not due to any significant change in our underwriting strategy. I\u2019ll also note that the new EveryDay product has performed well relative to our expectation since its launch a few months ago. But it is of course far too early for the product to have any meaningful impact on our overall levels of loan growth. Putting it all together then, our billings and loan performance helped drive total revenue growth of 5% on both the reported and FX adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 8. Consistent with prior periods, this growth was primarily driven by greater discount revenue from higher build business volumes. During the quarter, discount revenue growth did not accelerate as fast as billings grow due primarily to a 4 basis point year-over-year in the reported discount rate. Now on this point, I would remind you that in any given quarter, the year-over-year discount variants can be influenced in part by the timing of certain items. This can lead to some volatility in the variants from quarter to quarter. For example, as you will recall, our discount rate was flat year-over-year during Q1 before being down 4 basis points this quarter. On a year-to-date basis therefore, the discount rate is down 2 basis points which is roughly in line with our expectations. Moving on from discount revenue, the other primary driver of revenue growth was a 9% increase in net interest income. As we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average flow of balances. Turning now to provision. You can see on Slide 9 that our credit metrics are near or at historical low levels. Worldwide, lending write-off in delinquency rates decreased in the quarter with our delinquency rate reaching an all-time low at 1%. As we\u2019ve said previously, our goal is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but is instead to achieve the best returns on our portfolio. Therefore, we would continue to expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from these low levels at some point. Slide 10 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. Overall, our coverage levels remain relatively consistent with the prior quarter and we believe are appropriate given the risk level inherent to the portfolio. Finally, as you can see on Slide 11, provision was down 6% versus the prior year reflecting lower lending write-offs in the current period. Charge card provision increased by 14% driven by a larger reserve release in the prior year. While the charge card delinquency rate declined versus Q1 during both years, we saw a larger sequential decline last year. Turning now to expenses on Slide 12, total reported expenses increased by 2%. In understanding this increase, it\u2019s important to note that both marketing and promotion and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the Business Travel joint venture game and related incremental initiatives. Turning to marketing and promotion first, the vast majority of the incremental costs encourage to support our growth initiatives or within marketing and promotion driving a 25% year-over-year in this line. There were some incremental costs that hit other lines. Second, as you can see, operating expenses were down 8% on a reported basis primarily as a result of the gain from the Business Travel joint venture which was recognized as an expense for adoption. On the operating expense line, this gain was partially offset by transaction related costs, the restructuring charge and the incremental contribution to the AXP Foundation. Turning to rewards expense, we saw an 11% increase relatively in line with reported billings growth. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 33.9% which was significantly higher than the unusually low 29.6% tax rate that we experienced during the second quarter of 2013. This quarter\u2019s 33.9% was in line with our prior expectations, though, that our tax rate could be closer to the mid-30s. To provide more context now on marketing and promotion expenses which include the majority of the investments to grow our business, Slide 13 shows that these expenses were at $985 million this quarter. We continue to believe that we have a number of attractive investment opportunities across our core business and from newer initiatives. The gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction this quarter provided the opportunity to increase our investments in some of our growth initiatives and better position the company for the future. The incremental investments included some media spending you may have seen in the U.S. to support the launch of the Amex EveryDay card and the relaunch of Serve. We also included some less visible investments including incremental card acquisition activities across the U.S. and international partners. During Q2, we also made progress on other important strategic initiatives including our OptBlue program with small merchant coverage. During the current quarter, we announced that four new merchant acquirers were added to OptBlue including First Data. And we continue to add new partners to the program. We also continue to be at the forefront of connecting consumers and merchants in new and innovative ways through digital capabilities. Our recent partnership with Uber which creates an elegant, seamless experience for U.S. card members to earn or redeem membership rewards points within the Uber mobile app is the latest example of how we are leverage unique technology to create value for merchants and consumers. While it is still early days for many of our digital initiatives, we are excited about the new capabilities we are developing in this space. Moving to operating expenses now on Slide 14, let me provide a bit more detail about the impact for the Business Travel joint venture. On a reported basis, total operating expenses decreased by 8% versus the prior year during the quarter. They were heavily impacted by the Business Travel joint venture transaction and related items including the gain which is recorded in other net expense, the restricting charge and the incremental charitable contribution. After taking into account these impacts, adjusted operating expenses increased by 4% versus the prior year. The higher adjusted growth rate compared to earlier this year is due to a number of smaller items. I\u2019d also remind you that we are now growing over the second quarter of last year which did experience the lowest levels of operating of any quarter during 2013. Let\u2019s turn now to the efficiency initiatives which drove the $133 million restructuring charge this quarter. The actions we are taking here are primarily related to positions that do not directly impact revenue including some actions that will be taking place over the next year. These initiatives are designed to improve our efficiency, better align us with changing customer preferences and behaviors and contain operating expenses moving forward. More broadly, I would also remind you that going forward, Business Travel revenues and costs will no longer be embedded in our financial results. We will report only our share of the joint ventures earnings as we will account for it using the equity method. To help you with modeling this, Business Travel cost constituted approximately 11% of our total operating expenses during full year 2013. On the revenue side, Business Travel revenues constituted approximately 80% of our total travel commissions and fees during full year 2013. To conclude now with operating expenses on Slide 15, on a year-to-date basis, operating expenses remain well-controlled. After taking into account the specific items this quarter, adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the prior year. We remain committed to our annual target to have the operating expenses grow by less than 3% during 2014. We will adjust our target for the balance of the year to account for the Business Travel operating expenses that will no longer be reflected in our P&L. Now let\u2019s turn to capital, the substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 87% of capital to shareholders while also maintaining our strong ratios. As you can see on Slide 17, we have also improved the diversity of our funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years. Our funding mixture in Q2 was consistent with the prior year. And we believe that the mix should be relatively stable going forward. Let me now turn to one more topic before I conclude and take your questions. As you are aware, our trial with the DOJ began earlier this month. The government is currently presenting their case. We will then present our defense and call witnesses on behalf of American Express. The trial is expected to end later this quarter and will be followed by the issuance of a decision which could take several months or longer to complete. There will then likely be a lengthy appeals process. As much as we might like to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate or beneficial to offer colored commentary on any of the specific testimony. We will make our argument were it matters in the court room. We believe that our legal defense is strong, but ultimately it will be up to the courts to decide. To remind everyone of the context, we decided to fight for three key reasons. First, it is unfair to allow merchants who have agreed to honor our cards to then discriminate against American Express and our card members. Second, it is fundamentally unfair to interfere with the consumer\u2019s right to choose how they want to pay at the checkout counter. And third, the result of Justice Departments seeks would provide no benefit to consumers. Instead, it would weaken competition. So to summarize now on the quarter, while there are some complexity in our reported results this quarter from the gain related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and our incremental initiatives, we feel good about our underlying performance during the quarter. Reported EPS was up 13% versus the prior year driven by accelerated billings and loan growth, write-off rates that remain at historical lows, disciplined control of our operating expenses and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?\nOperator: Certainly. (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Hi, good evening. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on loan growth, obviously, a little bit of an uptick this quarter. We\u2019re seeing a similar trend with some of the other issuers. Can you put into some context? Are you seeing a little bit better demand? Or is this something that is more onetime issue?\nJeff Campbell: Well, it\u2019s good and an important question. And certainly, we have been pleased over the last number of quarters to see loan growth in the 3% to 4% range at a time when the industry numbers were flattish to in some quarter down a little bit. And when you look at that growth over the last year, so it really has been driven by spending of our card members. And as we look at the sequential acceleration from 4% to 6% this quarter, we still see it pretty much just driven by spend levels of our card members that certainly one can speculate goes along with just continued levels or growth and levels of confidence about the economy. So there\u2019s certainly nothing unusual in terms of timing or accounting or any of those items. I mean we think that the sequential pickup in growth rates is very solid, and assuming the economic environment stays the same, we would hope that it continues at that trend. I think the other thing I really do want to emphasize that I mentioned that I mentioned in the earlier remarks is it just increased spend that has driven the loan growth. We are very focused and very comfortable with our current risk profile and so you haven\u2019t seen us make any significant changes in the various decisions we\u2019re making around risk.\nDon Fandetti \u2013 Citigroup: Thanks.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending trends, understanding everything that you\u2019ve gone through in great detail about how the sale of the \u2013 or the formation of the JV influencing the spending trends in the period. How should we contemplate some of these line items going forward particularly, of course, the marketing and promotion line and as well as the salaries and employee benefits line as a consequence of some of the restructuring actions you\u2019ve undertaken?\nJeff Campbell: So I\u2019d probably break that into two parts, Eric. On things like marketing and promotion, as we\u2019ve said for a couple of quarters now we clearly saw the opportunity with the business travel gain to increase spending levels this quarter but I would expect to see them go back towards what I would call more normal or normalized levels beginning next quarter. There\u2019s some seasonality in that and you see that seasonality quite clearly in the chart on Slide 13, but that\u2019s what I would expect to see next quarter on the marketing and promotion side. In terms of the restructuring charge that we took, you are quite correct in that that will drive some economies for us in the coming quarters. However, you can imagine that given the size of the charge, there is some complexity to the changes that we will be making and so it will take us into 2015 before you will see the economic benefit on the operating expense side of the restructuring charge we took and the changes that it will facilitate us making to our operation over the course of the next year or so.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson: Okay, great. And if I could just also follow up, I think in the footnotes it mentioned that you took a charge for a change in the membership rewards alternate redemption rate and is that distinct from the restructuring charges that you called out and if so can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that figure?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, it\u2019s completely distinct from anything we called out. And the way I would think about this, Eric, is you have seen us over the last couple of years make a couple of all-related incremental improvements in the methodology we use for estimating this liability. This was one of the last remaining pieces of that change. We made earlier changes in the more material markets. And so that\u2019s why this was smaller charge but it was still significant enough to call out for you that I believe now brings us globally to where we have adopted a new and we believe a better methodology for how we calculate URR around the globe. But that is all completely separate from the discussion we had around the incremental investments we chose to affirmatively make in the quarter to help grow the business.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson: And the magnitude?\nJeff Campbell: The magnitude, it\u2019s probably worth a couple of pennies.\nEric Wasserstrom \u2013 SunTrust Robinson: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Next question from the line of Vincent Kentek [ph] of Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nVincent Kentek \u2013 Macquarie: Yes, thank you. Just one quick question and one more follow up question. On the spend growth this quarter, it\u2019s very, very strong. I was wondering if you could kind of guide us on to whether to expect that spend growth for the rest of 2014 or if we should be kind of thinking about the first half of \u201814 as the loan growth. And then, kind of on the incremental growth initiatives investments made this quarter and understanding it\u2019s early days, but when should we be thinking about, say, the revenue opportunities that come from those investments? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, on spend growth going forward, boy, we are always really cautious about trying to project forward, because as you know it\u2019s in our \u2013 results are tied to a number of things but including what happens economically. And I would say, as we look at the June 4% to 9% billing growth rate, we are reasonably pleased with that number given the fact that the economy is with the very, very big slow down that we saw in Q1. When you look at Q2 and you look at year-over-year growth in the economy and I\u2019d remind everyone that\u2019s really what our year-over-year billings growth is more correlated to and not necessarily the sequential trend in GDP but the year-over-year trend. The latest forecast that I look at for the June quarter and we\u2019ll all see the numbers in the coming weeks, make an estimate that the year-over-year growth in GDP is probably down in the 1.2% to 2% range. So when it\u2019s given \u2013 if that in fact turns out to be the case, they have 9% billings growth, it\u2019s actually something we\u2019re fairly pleased with. Obviously, what happens going forward is going to be heavily impacted by what happens to that year-over-year economic growth number, particularly in the US economy which is still the largest chunk of our billing so we\u2019ll have to \u2013 have to see where that plays out. I would just make the observation that as we\u2019ve looked at our June quarter results and billings trend, there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual or one time oriented to two of those numbers. I think they\u2019re reflective of the core underlying run rate of the business in that quarter, in the economic environment. In terms of when the incremental investments pay off, as we always do and we think about investments, we invest in a range of things that have payoffs from very short to medium term to a few things that have very long-term payoffs. When you look at the restructuring charges, there is a very detailed set of plans for the changes we will make and when we will get the benefits and they will be mostly fully played out or mostly in place by the time you get out 12 months from now. If you look at the spend on growth initiatives, when you think about things like the EveryDay Card launch and our card acquisition efforts, those will begin to show more of an impact as you get in to the second, third, fourth quarters from when we make those investments. The one long-term thing we did is as we\u2019ve said for quite some time on Serve, that is a long-term proposition for us that we believe in. And this is the first time we\u2019ve ever really done any media on Serve and I\u2019d remind you that that is an area where we really are trying to in some ways create a new category, and we have to help our customers understand how to use that product and how it can really help make their financial life better. That\u2019s a longer-term prospect. So that\u2019s how I would think about the range of investments from close-in to medium term to longer term.\nVincent Kentek \u2013 Macquarie: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: Thank you. Good evening. I don\u2019t want to ask about anything relating specifically to the DOJ case, but I had a broad question surrounding the notion of market power. One of the key points in prior cases involving AMX is that I don\u2019t believe you guys have ever been found to have market power. And that\u2019s been a key reason why you\u2019ve been able to avoid direct regulation in places like Australia. But as we look ahead at the investments that you continue to make in the business, the share gains that you\u2019ve enjoyed since the Great Recession and the anticipated continued growth that should continue as we look ahead, how do you think about the risk that it could just be a matter time before you\u2019re viewed as having market power? And I guess, is market power simply an outcome and you\u2019ll deal with it if and when the time comes that you\u2019re found to have it or is it something that you don\u2019t anticipate becoming an issue anytime soon because your biggest network competitors have so much more share than you? Maybe if you can just speak broadly to that notion of market power, that\u2019d be great.\nJeff Campbell: I\u2019ll \u2013 though, I will make just a few very brief comments. Of course, just to be clear, as you stated, there is no finding anywhere that we have market power around the globe. Two, we work really hard every day because of the unique nature of our closed-loop network to demonstrate the value we provide to the merchants and the value we provide to our card members and none of whom has to have our product or have acceptance of our product, and we work at that every single day. Third, I would just make the factual statement that once you leave the US market, our market shares are very, very small in other countries around the globe. So I think given, as you prefaced your question with the tendency of the DOJ trial though I probably should limit my comments to those, but these are all issues we, of course, feel very strongly about.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: I appreciate that completely and understand. Maybe as a follow up, unrelated. Can you discuss the rationale underlying the Serve initiative at Wal-Mart? I guess I was a little bit confused by just from a high level, I thought that the strategy was that the Bluebird product was going to be kind of the primary platform used at Wal-Mart but that Serve would kind of be used elsewhere, but it sounds like Serve and Bluebird are both available at Wal-Mart. Maybe you could speak to that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I guess, I\u2019d make a couple of comments. If you draw an analogy to our card or credit business, we have many different products in all of the countries around the globe in which we do business because they all serve different target segments and we think there is tremendous value in having the right card for the right customer. And so, I think Wal-Mart as they think about what they want to offer to their customers, similarly believes that there should be a range of choices and that different products will provide different sets of capabilities and features to customers and that choice is a good thing. And so we\u2019re both \u2013 our philosophy and Wal-Mart\u2019s philosophy are quite aligned on this. To us it seems very natural to put in the end the consumer in the drive seat so that they can make a choice.\nBill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities: Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Yes, thanks. My main question is around expenses. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts here. And the first part of it relates to the salaries expense. I think Eric asked about this but I didn\u2019t hear a response to it. I think you indicated in the supplements that salaries were increased 7% year-over-year predominantly due to restructuring charges. Were those for the recurring severance-related expenses or are those investments that\u2019ll lead to a continued kind of year-over-year increase in salaries? I mean, just the second part of that is your broader 3% \u2013 sub 3% annual year-over-year growth target. I think you indicated Jeff that you\u2019re now kind of lapping some of the best quarters from expense reductions and you\u2019re now kind of growing off of that. Should we expect some operating expense growth in the back half of the year?\nJeff Campbell: So, let me take those one at a time. And, Mark, your question makes \u2013 I think, perhaps, we weren\u2019t as clear as we should have been. So when you think about the $133 million restructuring charge that we took, that amount will appear in the salaries and benefits line predominantly. There\u2019s a very small piece that relates to some facilities but most of that charge is for a number of cases around the globe where we will be making changes to our operation and it is for severance for several thousand people as we make those changes and get the right people with the right skill sets and the right places to provide great service for our customers. So that\u2019s what drove the salaries and benefits line up this quarter. And that\u2019s where as you go out over the course of the next four quarters and we execute on these plans, you will see the savings or benefits, if you will, of those restructuring, in the salaries and benefit line. So hopefully, that clarifies that point. In terms of operating expense, you did see a particular low point in last year\u2019s second quarter, and so that\u2019s the only point I was making when I noted that I think in the first quarter our operating expenses were actually down a little bit year-over-year whereas this quarter they were up 4%. We are very committed and I think have demonstrated a really good track record of controlling operating expenses. So there is no particular plan in place to sequentially begin to grow operating expenses again as we go in to the back half of the year. We remain very committed to hitting that less than 3% target for the full year.\nMark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Great. And then just one other question if I could. Could you give us some color on where your pipeline is for potential new GNS partnerships? Is there enough there where you think you might be able to sustain kind of a low-to-mid teens year-over-year growth and billings that you had there?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t want to comment on specifics of partnership discussions we may be involved in. But I think the more important point is that when you look at the growth that we have consistently shown in GNS, that growth is not necessarily drive by the steady addition of new partners. It\u2019s driven by the fact that we have a lot of great existing partners who, in fact, operate in some of the higher growth markets around the globe and/or operate in certain markets like China where our presence is still in \u2013 I would call it, it\u2019s earlier stages in therefore much higher growth. And so, the sustainability of that higher growth level, well, one element that help support it is signing new partners; far more important really is the performance of the partners we have around the globe and we feel very good about that performance and about the continue opportunities for growth.\nMark DeVries \u2013 Barclays: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good evening. My question really relates to the incremental growth initiatives and thank you for providing a little bit of color in terms of how you\u2019re using those investments or how you\u2019re making those investments. And I think one of the challenges that investors have in terms of some of these gains historically that have been used to support growth is that it\u2019s very difficult to really understand where the tangible benefits ultimately are going to come from. And maybe there is a way to help us dimensionalize how we should be thinking about where this is going to materialize whether it would in terms of just average spending growth or if you think that ultimately it\u2019s going to drive cards enforced growth first and ultimately will begin to work its way in to the billings patterns, and what the real kind of timeline we should be expecting these initiatives to ultimately pay us back. And I recognize that you make a series of investments and I\u2019ve \u2013 you kind of understand from historical discussion, but anything, given this large nature of spend in this quarter would be very helpful.\nJeff Campbell: Well, that\u2019s a \u2013 Ken, a fair and very important question. I\u2019d make a couple of comments. Certainly, we have detailed works and analysis we do here to determine how to prioritize the spending we do on growth initiatives. Let me talk about the efficiency initiatives separately in just a second. And so on those growth initiatives we continue to believe even in the quarter we just finished that as we look at our acquisition efforts we actually still have more ROI-positive opportunities than we are able to fund while still meeting our earnings targets. We clearly could go further this quarter but all of those initiatives are closely tracked. We have a quite analytical understanding of what happens as we do various kinds of acquisition activities around the globe and feel very good about the payoff that will come on those investments. I would note however that the incremental spend in the context of the overall size of our company and the overall size of spending we do is fairly modest. So this did not double our spending for the quarter or for the year. It\u2019s a much \u2013 if you think about this on an annual basis, this is adding 5% or 10% to our spend. So you will clearly see it in growth in revenues over time; practically, it is hard to break that out of the consolidated level. At a very detailed level, we will be tracking it very closely. When you look at the media spend on the EveryDay Card which is the largest chunk of the media spend, which should be fairly obvious if you watch TV hopefully, that is harder to measure. On the other hand we have a very clear way to measure the success and growth of the EveryDay Card and we\u2019ll see that, we believe and hope, grow to be a very sizeable and profitable product for us in the coming quarters and years. So that\u2019s the revenue side of the equation on the efficiency initiatives, a very clear pathway to getting far more benefit than what you would need to justify the restructuring charge and we will begin to see those benefits fully phased in as you get in to 2015. Again, the challenge and you\u2019re seeing them from the outside, and the P&L is one of scale; when you think about the overall magnitude of our expense base, we do lots and lots of things everyday to continually find ways to be more efficient so that we can achieve the kind of control of our operating expenses that you\u2019ve seen us achieve over the last couple of years. This is a piece of that. And you should see it in continued strong performance on the operating expense line. So I realize that may not be as specific to these initiatives and I will make a note here and we should think a little bit about how we in future quarters try to take some of our own ability at more of a micro level to think about how these initiative is doing and give you a little bit of color into them\nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, thanks. That would be appreciated. One follow up, fine tuning or maybe two fine tuning questions. There is a reference to a Community Reinvestment Act portfolio, fair value adjustment or valuation adjustment. I assume that was an impairment; can you give us what the size of that was if it was material? And then secondarily, if there is any way to give us some sense as to how the Wells Fargo roll out is going?\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me take those maybe in reverse order. So Wells Fargo, we\u2019re certainly very pleased with our broader relationship with Wells Fargo and it\u2019s a growing relationship. But it\u2019s very early days in terms of the GNS launch. What I would say is we certainly are pleased though to see some of the comments that John Stumpf made just a few weeks ago about the partnership and, gosh, rather than me commenting on it, I love the fact that John came out and said they\u2019re very pleased and see the partnership with us as being off to a very, very good start. So I supposed he\u2019s a better judge in some ways that we are. And so we\u2019re thrilled to see that. On the Community Reinvestment Act, as with many accounting issues, we are constantly ensuring that we have the best methodologies for estimation and this is one where we have a revised approach to how we estimate what we should be booking and that\u2019s what we switched to this quarter and it did drive an incremental expense amount that you see called out in the release as we made today.\nKen Bruce \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you for your comments.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Thank you. I got a couple of questions. One on the revenue yields. When we think about the net interest yield going forward, that cropped pretty significantly sequentially. I\u2019m not sure if that was seasonal or something but how should we think about its progression going forward. Same thing with the discount rate, I know you addressed it but maybe you could just talk about the migration going forward, will there be stability in that discount rate going forward. And then, second question is around the $0.05 gain that you guys recognized this quarter; when we think about how you guys assess yourselves relative to your targets, I assume that will be inclusive of that $0.05. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: So a couple of comments and I\u2019ll take those one at a time. First, on the net interest yield, you are actually correct Sanjay in one of your comments which is there is some seasonality. And if you go back and look at the slides we have, you actually see that year-over-year the net interest yield is up a little bit. And that, of course, is predominantly driven by the continued steady averaging down of our interest expense rates give the rate environment. And so, there is no \u2013 in terms of the sequential trend, I wouldn\u2019t focus on that. I\u2019d stay more focused on the year-over-year trends. On the discount rate, as I said in my remarks, we had a number of timing items that actually impacted both the first quarter making the first quarter essentially flat year-over-year and in essence some things that would have caused it to go down a little bit in the first quarter, slipped into the second quarter and you saw a 4 basis point decline. More broadly, we said for a number of years that you should expect to see discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year, and that\u2019s because of our continued focus on driving more EveryDay spend. It\u2019s a function of location. It\u2019s a function of our merchants growing and hitting volume-based triggers steadily over time. It\u2019s a function of a very competitive environment and it\u2019s a function of evolving mix. So all of those things, those are the long terms trends that have been in place for many, many years and you can look at the trend over the last five, six years and see how we\u2019ve done historically based of all of those trends and managing the discount rate. So when you look at the year to date numbers, we\u2019re pretty much in line with the trend. You just have to take that noise out of having the first quarter look unusually good year-over-year and the second quarter look unusually bad. That\u2019s first. And the second comment, I think your third question was how we think about the $0.05 of EPS, is that \u2013\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: Yes, that\u2019s right. When we think about the targets that you guys have outlined in terms of long-term targets, will that $0.05 be included in that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, of course, we never provide guidance. We\u2019re very public about our long-term targets being out there at 12% to 15%. And our goal, Sanjay, is to drive our earnings in the second half as much as we can. What I would say is that you heard me mention in my earlier remarks that there are some transaction-related costs that are going to lag into the third and fourth quarter. And so, as we think about the full year, the incremental cost that are going to lag into the back half of the year are going to offset some portion still to be determined precisely of that $0.05. So yeah, I guess, as we think about the full year, we are likely to think about the $1.43 because the full year impact of all the elements of the JV are likely to be more of a watch.\nSanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW: All right. I got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks. I guess the first question I had was the \u2013 it seems like if you take the gain and you x out the kind of one-time items, you have about $300 million left that you reinvested, and it also seems like starting in Q3 you\u2019ll have roughly $200 million less in revenue from the travel joint venture, from the accounting, for the travel joint venture. So how long do you think it would take before those $300 million of extra investments were able to replace kind of that $200 million revenue?\nJeff Campbell: Well, remember, Moshe, we also lose $200 million of expense relating to travel business.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Right.\nJeff Campbell: Quite well \u2013\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Just thinking about the revenue growth.\nJeff Campbell: Yes, yes. Right. So when you think about the kind of things we\u2019re investing in as you get into as I said earlier quarters two through six is when you should really see the card-related spend on EveryDay and the acquisition efforts begin to have a material impact. Now, of course, our bottom line goal here is to drive earnings for the company, not necessarily to a dollar-for-dollar replace the revenue \u2013\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Sure.\nJeff Campbell: \u2013 of the travel business, but that\u2019s probably the framework I would use for thinking about it.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Right. And the second \u2013 the kind of the follow, a couple of people have talked about the discount rate. You mentioned just some of the components, I thought that also cash back rewards is netted out of the discount, merchant discount and has that been factor? Because that\u2019s been area in which cash back rewards has kind of grown as an industry issue. Could you talk about that a little bit?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, so it\u2019s probably worth clarifying, Moshe, exactly what\u2019s in what number. So the discount rate that we provide is a calculated discount rate meant to represent what we get for economics from merchants where we are acquirer. And so that calculation which we do and then report out on every quarter is the one that went down 4 basis points this quarter. There are other people who do a very simple calculation. They look at our GAAP financial statement and they divide discount revenue into billings and that gives you a discount rate that is significantly lower. And neither of those things is reflective of the economics we\u2019re getting at the merchants which is why we pull them out of our calculated number. But it is why you see growth in the different between our calculated discount rate that we report and the simple calculation that you get when you divide up the GAAP income statement discount revenue into billings. All that said, you are correct that cash back products have been very strong products for us, and that\u2019s a very good thing. It does drive up cash back rewards cost at a little higher rate than revenue growth. And since account [ph] to revenue it has the effect I just described. So hopefully that clarifies for you the way these pieces fit together.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Mostly though because \u2013 but you had said that the \u2013 I thought you had said that your discount rate included some of the payments to merchants for the contract signings and now you just said that some of those are not included.\nJeff Campbell: No, it\u2019s not \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean to say that. I don\u2019t \u2013 so what\u2019s not included in our calculated discount rate to come back to it is the economics we have with GNS partners which we pull out, and the cash back rewards cost and the client incentives. There\u2019s a few other very, very small things but those are the large timings [ph]. With merchant signing, an example would be that we\u2019re constantly every day out there competing for the business of our merchants. And as we\u2019ve \u2013 particularly with some of the larger merchants and in any B2B negotiations sometimes you might have a contract that expires in one quarter but you don\u2019t get around to actually finishing the renegotiation until the next quarter. You\u2019ll make the contract retroactive to the prior quarter when the prior contract expired. That would be an example of where you\u2019re going to get a timing impact as you look at the discount rate quarter to quarter that\u2019s not reflective of the ongoing rate.\nMoshe Orenbuch \u2013 Credit Suisse: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli \u2013 William Blair: Thank you. And I beat a dead horse I guess on the incremental growth initiatives. It\u2019s a little confusing as to \u2013 you have so many opportunities, why would you spend it all in the incremental cost in one quarter? I mean, are you under-investing versus your opportunities overall and so therefore \u2013 I mean, you have more \u2013 you should be driving more expense through the year and forget about this year\u2019s earnings growth target to drive long-term value for investors or should have that investment \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you have any spread of that \u2013 spread that over a couple of different quarters to support growth. So I\u2019m just a little confused by why \u2013\nJeff Campbell: Yes.\nBob Napoli \u2013 William Blair: \u2013 all those incremental investments are in this quarter. And if you have so many additional positive ROI growth initiatives why are you not spending more longer \u2013 not only this quarter but the next several quarters?\nJeff Campbell: Oh, boy, those are great questions, Bob. Let me take it in two parts. If you think about over the medium to long term how we manage the company, we\u2019re trying to balance lots of different things. We\u2019re trying to balance achieving these steady, consistent financial performance that I think all of our shareholders have come to expect from us with a reality of the competitive world we live in that makes it challenging to get to our near-term financial targets with the need to investment for the medium and long term and make sure we\u2019re positioning this company to be a successful five years from as it will be next quarter. So as we try to balance all of those things, you are correct that one of the things we are trying to maximize is making sure we achieve that steady financial performance. And that does force us to prioritize how we make investment choices and when we make those investments. And it does cost us at times to defer going down the path on certain growth initiatives to a future date because we think that\u2019s the right balance between that steady financial performance, short-term investments and longer-term investments. That\u2019s the longer-term view. If you think about this quarter, I guess what I would point out is in many ways you had a confluence here of the reality that we have been on in a reengineering journey for several years and it was very logical for us to take the moves that drove the restructuring charge this quarter. We\u2019ll actually enact those over the course of the next year but we think it just made sense to pair it up with the gain. Similarly, it just was a nice coincidence that we launched the EveryDay Card at the end of March and early April, so it coincided very nicely to do a big blitz of spend on Everyday, right, at the time of the second quarter. Again, somewhat similarly we just re-launched Serve late last year and felt this was a good time to do the first ever really media blitz. Lastly, I just remind you the business travel transaction is one we have been working on for a very long time. We knew well in advance the timing of when it was likely to happen. And that really allowed us to be thoughtful and planful in all of our marketing and operational plans this year to take advantage of the timing. So we don\u2019t we suboptimized how we used that gain. We actually think that it allows us to \u2013 in a very planful way do a lot of things that we have had on our plate for awhile and will pay off for our shareholders in the coming quarters.\nBob Napoli \u2013 William Blair: Great. And just a follow-up question \u2013 thank you for that \u2013 is on the travel joint venture, is there a new strategy that\u2019s being embarked upon and, I mean, you still have the $1 billion \u2013 nearly $1 billion of value in that business and it is still, I think, important to American Express, is there a new acceleration of growth strategy? I mean, is it looking to compete in a different area of travel to \u2013 I mean, is it the idea here to accelerate growth and then how does American Express still benefit from that business?\nJeff Campbell: Boy, to be very clear, we created this joint venture because we are excited about the prospects for it to grow and to use the capital that is now in the business and that focus that is now on the business to create better products, to grow faster, to create better technology, to improve customer service. And, of course, we will continue to work very closely from a business perspective with the joint venture to serve our mutual customers in a coordinated and combined way. I would remind you it will be called American Express Travel still, so we\u2019re all in and very excited about the fact that we think this is not just a good transaction in the short term for our shareholders but is actually a transaction that will lead to a much stronger travel company in the coming years and we will benefit in many ways from that\nBob Napoli \u2013 William Blair: Great. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Okay, so I think, operator, we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Okay. And the final question comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Just one quick clarification on the accelerated spend in marketing. With the recognition of that, is it the case that, say, for something like the production of television ads or radio ads, that you might be recognizing expenses in the second quarter but then the ads might not air for subsequent quarters, so you kind of front loaded the spending as much as \u2013 those who watch television actually see the ads?\nJeff Campbell: No, I think the reality of how we do our accrual accounting is we have put in to our second quarter P&L what we ran during the second quarter P&L and going forward you will see running through our P&L whatever we run going forward.\nChris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay.\nJeff Campbell: So we think we were able to get a really strong start for the EveryDay Card and give a strong boost to Serve; and our job going forward will be to build upon that.\nChris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. And then just quick clarification your comments about the revenue and expenses for the joint venture, you did say that was using operating expenses, not total expenses, right, I think the 11% number.\nJeff Campbell: Yes, absolutely.\nChris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay.\nJeff Campbell: So if you take \u2013 and we\u2019re using 2013 as a baseline to help you with modeling about 11% of operating expenses and about 80% of the travel commissions and fees line.\nChris Donat \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.\nJeff Campbell: Okay.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me thank you all then for joining tonight\u2019s call and participating in the Q&A. I think, to close the call, I believe, while there\u2019s some complexity in our results, I think the questions demonstrated that from the joint venture transaction. We feel good about the underlying performance of the company and with that I will wish you all a good evening.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 1, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-04-17 00:04:03", "content": "Executives:  Rick Petrino - SVP, Investor Relations Jeff Campbell - EVP and CFO \nAnalysts:  Craig Maurer - CLSA Don Fandetti - Citi Mark DeVries - Barclays Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Bob Napoli - William Blair Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley David Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets Daniel Furtado - Jefferies and Company \nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.

Please go ahead, sir.\nRick Petrino: Thank you, Tony. Welcome, we appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company's other reports already on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell : Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. Our performance this quarter showed strong earnings per share growth driven by disciplined controlled of operating expenses, another quarter of write-off rates near historical lows and a strong balance sheet that has allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases over the past year. We delivered 16% EPS growth despite having modestly lower revenue growth sequentially. And these results highlighted once again the flexibility of our business model. During the quarter, we took several important strategic steps including rolling out our OptBlue program to expand the coverage amongst smaller merchants, launching a new credit Amex EveryDay designed to capture a greater share of everyday consumer spending; and expanding Loyalty Partner by introducing the program in Italy. All of these steps are part of our broader strategy to reach new segments of the market and make the American Express brand more welcoming and more inclusive.  Additionally, in the quarter we were pleased that the Fed did not object to the capital plan included in our 2014 CCAR submission. And we were also pleased to sign the formal agreement for the Business Travel joint venture that we announced last year. I'll discuss each of these items in more detail later on the call.  To begin now with our financial results for Q1. As you can see on Slide 2, FX adjusted billed business growth was 7%. This increase was the primary driver of FX adjusted revenue growth of 5%. Both of these growth rates represent a modest deceleration versus Q4 levels which occurred predominantly in the U.S. market and was more pronounced among our U.S. small business and corporate card members.  Net income of $1.4 billion was up 12%. The increase was driven by a combination of greater revenues, continued tight control of operating expense. Over the last four quarters we repurchased more than $4 billion of our common shares that translated into a 4% decline in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then allowed us to grow our diluted EPS by 16%. These results call to mind the presentation we made at our Investor Day in February of last year when we laid out several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and over time earnings targets in a variety of economic environments. Given the slower revenue growth we experienced during the first quarter, our strong capital position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial performance and helped to drive 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.33.  These results also brought our ROE for the period ending March 31 to 28% above our on average and over time target of 25%.  Let's turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with billed business on Slide 3. Overall billings remained solid with an FX adjusted increase of 7% versus 9% last quarter. The sequentially slower growth was primarily in the U.S. where billings rose 6% in Q1 compared to 9% during Q4. I said a minute ago this decline was more evident among our small business and corporate card members. Additionally, volume growth rate appeared to be influenced in part by the severe winter weather. I would add that while we are always cautious about drawing conclusions from intra-period trends, we were encouraged to see that U.S. billing growth increased over the second half of the quarter as the weather improved. Outside the U.S. where volumes continue to growth at a faster pace than the total company, billed business was up 10% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, growth rates across international regions were generally consistent with the prior quarter and we did see a small uptick in EMEA from 6% in Q4 to 7% in the current quarter.  Turning to billed business by segment on Slide 4, volumes continue to be particularly strong in GNS, up 15% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region powered largely by China and Japan. You do see across both the regional and segment view of our billings that the stronger U.S. dollar continued to put downward pressure on our billings and hence revenue growth as has been the case for the last five quarters. To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have provided on Slide 5 some background on the major concentrations of our billed business by international currency.  The first row shows the approximate range of billed business in each market as the percentage of total billed business. While the bottom row shows the year-over-year change in that foreign currency compared to the U.S. dollar. Overall, in Q1 this mix translated into approximately one percentage point reduction in both billings and revenue growth.  Moving on now to loans, the other key revenue driver. We see on Slide 6 that loan balances grew 3% globally. U.S. loans were up 4% from a year ago. Both of these growth rates are consistent with what we saw in Q4. I\u2019ll also note that the total level of loans declined $3.2 billion versus Q4 which is in line with normal seasonal trends. We are pleased that our loan growth in the U.S. continues to outpace the industry average. Putting all the pieces of revenue together you see on Slide 7, the total revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis. Consistent with our spend-centric model this growth was primarily driven by the discount revenue growth that was generated by increased spending volumes. The other primary driver of revenue growth was an 8% increase in net interest income as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding cost and an increase in average loan balances.  Another point I would make about our revenues was that the sale of our publishing business last year continues to depress the growth rate of other revenue and impacted total revenue growth this quarter by a little less than 1%.  Turning now to provision. You can see on Slide 8 that our credit metrics remain near all time lows. Worldwide lending write-off and delinquency rates increased slightly in the quarter, consistent with seasonal trends. As a reminder our objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but is instead to achieve the best economics on our portfolio. Therefore, at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from today's low levels.  Slide 9 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate even the risk level inherent in the portfolio. The fact that our delinquency rates have become more stable and our loan portfolio was growing resulted in a smaller reserve release in the first quarter and a year ago. The smaller reserve release more than offset the benefit from lower write-offs this year and grow total provision up 17% compared to a year ago as you can see on Slide 10. The increase in the charge card provision in particular is primarily due to a reserve billed in the current year versus a reserve release in the prior year along with higher card member receivables. I'll also note that beginning this quarter we have reclassified fraud losses from provision for losses to operating expenses in order to be more consistent with industry practices. This had the effect of lowering provision and increasing operating expense, so we have reclassified prior periods for this change to keep everything comparable.  Turning now to expenses. On Slide 11, you can see the total expenses were down 1% versus the prior year. Clearly, maintaining disciplined control of expenses particularly our operating expenses was the key driver behind our strong earnings performance during the quarter. To comment on a few specifics, you see that while marketing and promotion was relatively flat in this quarter, going forward we do anticipate that investment levels will increase as we move into Q2. For rewards expense, you see growth that was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the quarter.  The key story around expenses is obviously operating expenses. And we provide more detail on these on Slide 12 which shows a 4% decline in total operating expenses versus the prior year with lower expenses seen across every line. We did benefit from the timing of certain items this quarter. But also remind you that the sale of our publishing business continues to suppress operating expense growth by a little more than one percentage point. That said, our operating expense decline this quarter went well beyond our goal for the full year of keeping growth to less than 3% as you can see on Slide 13.  Of course we remain committed to our annual target. But we would not expect to see similar declines in the remaining quarters of the year.  To turn more broadly now to our marketing and promotion efforts to grow our business, Slide 14 shows that these expenses were relatively flat versus a year ago in Q1. As you can see on the chart, marketing and promotion is typically lower during Q1 and ramps up beginning in Q2. We continue to see many attractive opportunities in the market place including those for new customer and merchant acquisitions. To be specific, during the quarter we launched Amex EveryDay, a new credit card that rewards card members for how often they use the card not just how much they spend. The reward structure intends card member to use the card for everyday purchases at the places they frequent most. We are excited about the potential of the product to attract new customer segments to our franchise. At our Investor Day in February, we introduced OptBlue, the next step in the evolution of our merchant acquiring program in the U.S. OptBlue give small merchants the convenience of working with our network of third party merchant acquirers who have the flexibility to give them one pricing construct, one monthly statement, one settlement process and one contract that covers all of the major card brands the merchant chooses to accept. In February, we reported that we had signed six merchant acquirers to the program. Since then we have continued to add partners and believe OptBlue will provide a significant lift to our small merchant acquisition efforts as it is rolled out. And we continue to target a portion of our investment for longer term opportunities, in particular focusing on two large initiatives. Reloadable Prepaid, a product that help you move and manage your money and Loyalty Partner, our rewards coalition program. These initiatives continue to ramp up as evidenced by this quarter's launch of our Loyalty Partner program in Italy where we now have over 3.5 million collectors as of the end of March. A common theme across all of these new initiatives is to have the American Express brand be more welcoming and inclusive; to be meaningful to more people and more merchants.  To return now to the financial. Turning to Slide 15, you see that during the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.1%. This is the second quarter in a row that our tax rate has been somewhat higher than the recent past. Tax rate as you know often fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to a variety of discreet items. More importantly over the longer term we have seen modest increase in our average effective tax rate primarily because of the changes in the geographic mix of where we generate income. Additionally, in 2014 we are being impacted by certain changes in tax laws including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemption and the loss of the R&D tax credit. In the past, we've mentioned that we expected our average effective tax rate to be in the low 30s range. When you look at the trend, we now believe that our rate for the full year could be closer to the mid 30s. And a last note on tax, I would point out that our tax rate at Q2, 2013 was just 29.6%. It was unusually low and was driven by certain discreet tax items. A challenge we will face in this year second quarter where will be growing over the impact of this lower rate.  Now let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital regenerate provides us with significant degrees of flexibility as shown on Slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 73% of capital to shareholders, while also strengthening our already strong capital operations. And we have worked hard to continue to strengthen all aspects of our capital planning processes. In last month we were pleased that the Fed did not object to capital plan included in 2014 CCAR submission. The good news from the Fed underscore both our balance sheet's strength and our ability to remain profitable under hypothetical severe stress scenario while also reflecting the strength of our overall planning processes. In fact, in the Fed severe scenario we have the highest pretax income as a percentage of assets among all bank holding companies and our Tier 1 common ratio both before and after capital actions were in the top quartile as you can see on Slide 17.  These results give us a leeway to increase our dividend by 13% beginning in the second quarter and to repurchase up to $3.4 billion of shares during the last three quarters of 2014 with up to an additional $1 billion during Q1, 2015. That represents a payout ratio that would be among the highest of all the CCAR participants. Our capital plan focused on three important priorities. Supporting our growth strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning a significant amount of the capital regenerate to our shareholders. One aspect of a strong balance sheet is maintaining a good mix of funding sources. And as you can see on Slide 18, we have improved the diversity of funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years. At this point, we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward. Before concluding I want to provide an update on the plans for our business travel joint venture. It's a reminder; our global business travel organization provides corporate customers with 24x7 support for travel in more than 135 countries. The agreement we signed this quarter entails our partners investing $900 million and the company contributing the assets of our business travel business to the joint venture. The new structure should provide greater resources to grow the business as a separate entity while maintaining important linkages with American Express. We still plan for the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter. However, as is the case with most sizable transactions there are regulatory aspects that could delay the transaction closing date. That we could receive regulatory approval very late in the second quarter which due to the complexity of the closing process could push back or second quarter earnings release date. We will keep you posted on the timing as we progress through the second quarter. More importantly, we expect to realize a sizable pretax gain which we currently estimate to be between $600 million to $700 million prior to considering any cost related to the transaction. As we have said before we plan to use a substantial portion of any gain net of transaction cost to position the company for the future. This will include supporting some of our newer growth initiatives including Amex EveryDay and Serve, as well initiative to increase the efficiency of the organization among other efforts. When we release Q2 results, we plan to provide additional detail to give you a clear understanding of our underline performance, the resulting gain on the transaction and associated cost, incremental spending and growth in other initiatives as well as the expected impact the JV will have as we present our results in the future.  So in summary, coming back to our first quarter result. Our strong earnings performance makes us feel good about the flexibility of our business model. We generated EPS growth above our on average and over time target driven by disciplined control of operating expenses, our strong capital position and continued low write-off rate. While billings and revenue growth slowed modestly from the first quarter, our financial performance was solid. Looking forward we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enabled us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.  With that I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question with only one follow up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Craig Maurer with CLSA. Please go ahead. \nCraig Maurer - CLSA: Yes, good evening guys, thanks. I wanted to understand your thought process on the spending trend in the quarter and how the shift of Easter into April affected the year-over-year comparison? \nJeff Campbell :  Well, I guess I would say couple things about the spending trend. As I said the sequential decline was clearly stronger amongst the small business and corporate card member segment. I think it is also important to point out that the sequential trend across the quarter and well that's something we are always very cautious as you know Craig to draw too much attention to because there is inherent volatility when you look at any short term period. But we did see the second half being stronger than the first. And I would say in the first few days of April, we haven't seen anything that contradicts that general trend. We do lots of internal analysis where we make a number of adjustments to how we look at our spending considering exactly what the days are or the week are in this period, trying to use historical patterns around holidays to make adjustments so when I make comments about trends they are considering all of those adjustments. All that said, there is clearly some art to doing something like an adjustment for a holiday like Easter that moves around quite a bit from year-to-year. So we take what we think is a fairly sophisticated approach to those adjustments but there are some subjectivity to it. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead \nDon Fandetti - Citi: Yes, good evening. Jeff, it looked like the March data suggest some slight uptick in year-over-year loan growth in the U.S.? Are you seeing any signs of increase consumer appetite for debt or are we just still in a holding pattern?\nJeff Campbell : Well, when you look at our loan growth Don it is actually been pretty consistent for the last few quarters at around 3% to 4%, globally it was 3%, this quarter little higher in the U.S., 4%. And when you look as you know at the industry data the industry has been bouncing around flat, sometimes down little bit. I think the February year-to-date numbers were up about half a point in the U.S. So we have certainly been pleased by the fact that our loan growth was holding steady at a little bit above that industry average. But frankly you don't see anything in our first quarter result that suggest any particular acceleration of that trend or do we see it yet in the industry data we\u2019ve looked at. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead. \nMark DeVries - Barclays: Yes, thanks. Jeff I know you indicated that we shouldn't expect to see OpEx remain at this kind of down 4% year-over-year level going forward. But if you don't see a meaningful acceleration of billed business growth particularly with the modest headwind we have now from kind of higher tax rate is it reasonable to think you\u2019ll have to remain kind of well below the cap of 3% growth, if you want the hit the on average over time targets for EPS growth this year? \nJeff Campbell : Well, I think Mark that's a very good question, really goes to the flexibility of our business model. As I said in my earlier comments, I would actually take you and other folks back to the February FCM when we showed that we have a quite a number of levers that we can pull and have a history of pulling. So certainly I would stick to the remarks I made a few minutes ago that the 4% decline year-over-year you see in the first quarter is not indicative of what you would expect -- should expect the next couple of quarters, there were some timing items. But we are very committed to using the flexibility of our business model to achieve our earnings targets. I think we have a pretty strong track record pulling various levers and how much we let operating expenses, and other expenses grow over the remainder of this year will certainly be heavily influenced by the economic environment we see. We don't try to out-guess the economic forecasters and we build plans based on consensus GDP forecast. The consensus has actually come down slightly in the last 90 days but we certainly hope that that\u2019s wrong and we hope the economy shows strong acceleration from here, but we think we have the flexibility in our business to react to whatever environment we face.\nMark DeVries - Barclays: Okay, that's helpful. In the earnings supplement there was comment that indicated U.S. consumer travel sales declined 7% year-over-year. The question I have is, is that trend you expect to continue? Were there any signs that weather affected that? And do you generate higher fees on the consumer side than you do on business travel? \nJeff Campbell : You have very sharp eyes for somebody who has only had an hour or two to stare at the voluminous amount of material we put out, so yes you are correct. The consumer travel business shows a decline of about 7%. That's actually driven by the fact that we\u2019ve sold a small part of that business that provided the packaged vacation, it was such a small transaction not particularly material so we didn't bother to call it out last year but that actually is what the loss of the revenue associated with that business or what drove the 7% decline. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead. \nSanjay Sakhrani - KBW: Thank you. I guess just focusing on the volume trends going forward. I mean when we think about and maybe even revenue growth, when we think about the trends going forward, are there any investments that you are making that might start paying their dividend sometime from second quarter onwards? And I guess broadly speaking, when I look back in time it seems like that 8% target hasn't been hit for a while and I guess over the past several years if not more it is probably only been hit once. So can you just talk about conceptually how you guys think about that revenue growth target going forward? Thanks. \nJeff Campbell : Well, we continue Sanjay to think that the 8% revenue target is an appropriate target on average over time and a non-average and over time economic environment. You are quite factually correct but if you look at the last few years our revenue has -- tends to be a little bit below that level. I would point out that despite that we have shown much better performance on the EPS side due to the flexibility of the business model I just talked about. We certainly have an economic environment over the last year that has not gotten to the global economies or in particular the U.S. economy\u2019s long term average trend. Certainly when you look at the original GDP consensus forecast for this year, there is target to approach those long term averages. It appears based on what economic data is out there so far that's probably not going to be the case the first quarter. And that is probably reflected somewhat in our results. But we would not in any way want to back off from the appropriateness of that 8% target and we continue to believe that as the economy returns to more normal growth rates, you will see us head towards that.  The other part of your question, we certainly are always balancing across our investment portfolio, things that are going to help us in the near term to medium term and the long term. And we have made a number of incremental investments and did some stepped up investing towards the latter part of last year and those are things that as you \u2013 if we follow normal patterns will help us as we get further into 2014 and beyond. You also as I mentioned in our remarks saw us launch a few \u2013 a new product in the U.S. market EveryDay just at the end of the last quarter. We just re-launched Serve at the end of last year, those are things that again as you get later into 2014 and beyond, you will begin to see meaningful contributions. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities: Hi, thank you. I had a question follow up on the JV thing. I believe that your reported expenses were decreased significantly once you deconsolidate that business travel segment and started accounted for it under the equity method. So I guess my first question is that right? And then more broadly how would that JV gain impact? How we should think about your commitment to that operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this year? \nJeff Campbell : Those are both very good questions, Bill. So first just may be to it sounds like you got and may be I should be making clear for everyone. So as we execute on the joint venture transaction that will shift our accounting to the equity method which means that all you will see in our P&L will be are proportionate 50% share of the joint venture's earnings each quarter. We won't report any revenues, we won't report any expenses. So that means you will see the travel and other commissions revenue line come down significantly into that line predominant thing within that line today is our revenues from the business travel joint venture. And then most of the expenses of business travel appear in the operating expense category. So both of those assuming we hit our current timeline beginning in the third quarter, you will no longer see the business travel amount in those rows. We will as we get close, as we get to in actual close give you the real specifics on that. But that's the structure or the methodology if you will but everyone should keep in mind as they think about what our finance statements will look like going forward. \nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities: Okay, thank you. If I may with one follow up. Can you talk about whether it is reasonable to expect that you are fully complete buybacks up to the full amount that was in your capital submission and then along those lines, can you talk about how are you thinking about the stock at these levels? I think in the past you guys have thought about capital return as capital return haven't I believe in a so much focused on the price. But I wanted to see if may be you could update us on the thought process. \nJeff Campbell : So let me those two questions. So certainly we are committed to the amount that the Fed did not object to in our CCAR submission. There is a very small portion of the total each year that is a little tricky at the end because what the Fed actually approves, not to get too in the details here, is a net repurchase amount net of the proceeds we get from option exercises. So as we go through the year and we get to the fourth quarter of CCAR year which is really the first quarter of the calendar year, we make an estimate of what we think the option exercise is going to be that year and then we conservatively size our share repurchase in that last quarter to match that, so if you did all the math, you do see we grew about $60 million or so below for the fourth quarter period what was approved in our 2014 CCAR. That's just sort of not to get into detail too much as I said. That's the mechanics of the process we do our best to estimate what's going to happen but option exercises are not always the easiest thing to exercise. More importantly and more broadly, you are correct and we do very much remained committed to the philosophy that we believe we should have a well capitalized and strong balance sheet. We believe we should pursue all the internal capital spending and external opportunity that we think are prudent and offer good return to our shareholders, once we are done with those two things, we don't believe we should sit on excess capital and so we will return capital once we have hit those first two objectives to our shareholders through a mixture of dividends, and our dividend for the factoring for our profile we think is a competitive dividend, and then we use share repurchase to return the remaining capital. We think we have a tremendous track record of growth over many, many years as a company. We continue to believe we have many growth opportunities going forward. And so we believe that is a good financial proposition for our shareholders to continue to return capital to our shareholders and we are not therefore very indifferent to modest swings in the price. I would also just make the observation that our stock in a normal economy environment is not a particularly volatile stock. And so just not figure greatly in our repurchase efforts I guess is the last comment I just remind you that mechanically as a public company these all kinds of constrains under which we buyback shares so practically you end up with more of an averaging in approach when you are returning a large amounts of capital that we return to our shareholders. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nBob Napoli - William Blair: Good afternoon. Question, at the GNS business continues to show very strong spent growth 15% then trending is at that level, but the revenue growth is only showing this quarter at 5% in that segment and I just like I mean do you think that GNS can continue to grow with those types of rates? And shouldn't revenue, why is not revenue growth matching the spend growth? \nJeff Campbell :  Well, couple of comments. First just a mechanical comment. Remember what you actually see in our statements is what we refer to as GNMS which is a mixture of our GNS business and the proportionate share of the little over 20 countries where we do the proprietary acquiring of the merchant portion of the economics. So it's really the GNS growth rate are not the same as the GNMS growth rate. All that said and we don't break the GNS growth rate out publicly separately. All that said, when you look at that GNS billings number, I try to always remind people that while we are really pleased with that 15% number, a portion of that high growth is driven by China. And China as you know is a market where because of the regulatory environment; it is very difficult for any player to get a lot of economics out of the billings. We are pleased with what we have been doing in China because we think without any capital expenditure we are building awareness in presence in brand in China that we believe we will find ways to monetize over the longer term. But in the near term, China is the market that produces a significant number o billing in our GNS business and very, very little revenue. So the GNS revenue is below that billing's number but you can't see it when you look at the GNMS number.  \nBob Napoli - William Blair:  Okay, then my second question is just on the OptBlue. And we've heard from some contacts that product is very well received by the market and it is only handful of merchant acquirers offering it today. But can you comment on what's your expectations are for OptBlue? Do you expect to have that in the hands of most merchant acquirers? At some point and then it does offer lower discount rate and are you comfortable with the economics and the strategic value of OptBlue as you seen operate now for a few months? \nJeff Campbell : Yes, good question. So the first, let me start on the facts, so when we first talked about this in February, we talked about the fact we had six merchant acquirers on board and we have been very pleased since then to add several more, and we think we are on a track to really get most of the industry on board and we are very excited about that. It is very, very early in the process. So we all need to watch and see how this plays out in the coming quarters and couple of years, but I would say all of our early experiences are positive and very reinforcing of the plans we set out at that February financial community meeting. And you are correct that there are some trade-offs here but what we also pointed out that we are in a fact offering a sort of my term a wholesale discount rate to the acquirer. There are also certain incentives that we have traditional paid to acquirer that go away, so that helps on portion of that wholesale rate that will just show up in a different place from financial perspective but helps offset it. Here the much more important thing is that we believe this program has the potential in the U.S. over the next several years to make very, very material dent in the coverage gap that we have in the U.S. And we think that is very powerful for our issuing businesses and can drive incremental volumes that will make this a very positive trade off for the company and for our shareholders. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Just a follow-up on the topic we were just talking about. You indicated the discount rate is a little bit lower but I'm just wondering lower than what, because when we look at your all-in discount rate obviously you would skew -- I would expect to some larger merchants. So are you suggesting the overall company discount rate is negatively impacted by this or just the like for like small merchant?\nJeff Campbell : Yes, that's a good question, Betsy. So to be very precise my comments are really directed at the economics with the very small merchants who are part of the OptBlue program. Now obviously any change with any merchant does affect the company's overall rate. But it is important to realize that while in merchants that we believe we will gain through this program are very important from a coverage and a perception of coverage perspective. In terms of the percentage of our total billing that these very small merchants generate that is very, very modest portion overall of our whole billings and therefore the impact on the company's overall discount rate is changes is very much moderated by that mathematical reality if you will. \nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Okay and then separately you indicated earlier in the call that the US billings growth rate was negatively impacted by weather and you ended the quarter better than the first couple of weeks of the quarter. Could you tell us what January, February, March was in terms of the year and your growth in billing year?\nJeff Campbell: Well, if you will, we don't like to break it out that specifically by month. I would just stick to the comments that the second half of the quarter was certainly stronger than the first half and we haven't seen anything in the early part of April that contradicts that trend. I'll also just make the observation that partly because of the closed loop, we have a tremendous amount of information by merchant by type of merchant, by industry, by city, by day, that allows us to do quite a detailed analysis of the impact of some of the most severe weather by city by day that you saw in a country and that's what makes us quite comfortable in my commentary that there certainly was weather impact in January and February.\nBetsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley: Okay and lastly on the expenses you indicated that there was some timing issue there and we shouldn't expect obviously to have this sub zero, 4% shrinkage in OpEx on go-forward basis. Is there anything that you have planning now to do that would be incenting incremental billings growth for Q2 and 3Q or really to get into that the kind of activity we have to wait for the closing of the global trouble business?\nJeff Campbell : Well, I guess I would say we generally are not targeting our spend decision in terms of the benefit of spending, we do quite is precisely as you just suggested by so that we know the benefits and how they're going to appear by quarter. We generally are making investment choices that we think will help us over longer time period. Certainly as I pointed out in my remarks, as you get into Q2, you would expect to see some incremental spending in a number of areas supported by the business travel. We did just launch the EveryDay card at the end of March, so we are really just in the introduction phase of that. The Serve product is in its very early days since we just re-launched with vastly improved functionality towards the latter part of last year. And there are probably a few steps you will see us taking that are just another step on our journey of the coming days and ever more efficient company with a really good solid cost structure and some of the things would drive some one time charges. So all of those things are targeted at helping us as we move into the latter part of 2014 and beyond. But I wouldn't want to suggest that there was precise thing help us in any specific quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group: Thanks. I had a follow-up to Betsy and Craig' question again about the trends in the first quarter of spending. And can you tell us the recovery in the second half of the quarter bring you back to sort of fourth quarter growth rates in the USCS or -- is there any other comments you have in terms of where the spending was weak in the first half aside from geography?\nJeff Campbell : Well, certainly so couple of comments. I gosh I don't want to get so specific that I am calling out specific numbers based on a few weeks. To step back for just a second and try a little bit context, I mean if you look over the last several years and our billing rates and our revenues rates, you will find some modest volatility quarter-to-quarter where we go up or down a point or two and it is not necessarily indicative of a long term trend so that's why we are cautious about even now talking about within a quarter or within a couple of weeks trends that overly specific. In terms of the specific geographies and industries I think it is all the things you would expect so if you pull out a weather database, you will see specific days in Europe and Boston and Chicago, in St. Louis of extreme weather and when we look at what happened in those places you see some pretty extreme results in those cities on those days, when you look at things like airline billings, it is lots of lots of public commentary about the massive, in fact that we record number of flights, that might whole industry manage to cancel in January and February, that's lost revenue to the airlines which is why they are talking a lot about how much revenue they lost, frankly it is also lost business to us. So those are the couple things I probably call out that are in these specific things we looked at. \nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group: And the travel aspect of that would be the reason you call out small business and corporate spend as opposed to consumer in the quarter?\nJeff Campbell : Well, that certainly a logical connection, I mean at some point all of that start, we can't understand the psychology of everyone of our card members, so at some point I want to be careful here because it gets to us making some educated judgments and we can't prove that to you but those have -- that fact pattern would appear to fit together to us.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group: My basic question was I just wonder if you could share any incremental thoughts about the European regulation, and given that we have been through now the parliament process, what is your thinking in terms of vulnerability of GNS business in Euro zone or UK?\nJeff Campbell : Well, certainly the -- those discussions are something that we are following closely. We are very engaged in and we spend a lot of time trying to help all of the players involved there, understand the real economics and the real competitive dynamics of that market place. Just to level set for everyone I would remind people that we are somewhere to use -- may be I use a cricket term but yeah we are in somewhere in the middle innings right because they first the commission published their draft proposal, the parliament came out just a few weeks ago with their version of the recommendations, the next thing is that the European Council recommendations and then there is sort of the equivalent of a conference committee in the U.S. where they all come together. We are very engaged and certainly there are some things we think in the regulation that are -- have the potential to have some real untended consequences and achieve results that are probably not what the regulators intended. Those are the kinds of things we have a lot of dialogue with them amount. All that said, we do business in many, many countries around the globe with many different types of regulatory regimes. And frankly our business model varies from country to country. So we are used to and a little experienced that dealing with evolving environment and evolving our business models. This is the situation that is very important to us. We are watching it very closely. We are going to just have to see how this all plays out which we think will continue to take some time.\nDavid Hochstim - Buckingham Research Group: You don't expect final resolution this by summer or something? \nJeff Campbell : No, not to go out on limb and guess politics but we don't. We would say at this point and you are correct that originally they were trying to get this done by April or May that is clearly not going to happen. Our view would be the earliest you could get to a resolution is probably much later this year and certainly could extend beyond that. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead. \nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets:  Thank you. Jeff, I do understand the cricket terminology so just stop over to -- \nJeff Campbell : Well, you'll have to educate me on what I just said. \nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Well, I do have a couple of questions. So first one was just to clarify the re-class of fraud losses out of provisions into operating expenses looking at I don't know if you disclose a specific number for this quarter but looked like the run rate was $70 million or so a quarter. Is that correct? Or maybe you disclosed the actual number for this quarter and I just missed it.\nJeff Campbell : Well, you are correct that the run rate tends to be $70 million to $80 million a quarter. I think we often talk about fraud on a basis point level because our fraud rate when you just look at industry data or as you know about half the industry were just for 70 to 80 is good run rate. I don't know, did we disclose a specific number more specific; it doesn't vary that much from quarter-to-quarter usually. \nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Okay. That's helpful. Then just the other question was in terms of the amexoffers.com there was the program where you can basically just go online check for offer, save them to your card and be able to redeem them. It looks like AMEX offers are basically ranked on individual relevant. So I'm kind of curious if there was anything that from a timing perspective or technology perspective that resulted this in kind of coming together relatively recently. I mean is this tied into your big data projects and trying to mine some of your consumer data to make more relevant offers? That was one question. The second part of it is how big do you see this program becoming potentially?\nJeff Campbell : Well, certainly we think that our ability to put together an offer eco system is particularly strong because of our close loop and a particular source of value both for our merchants and for our card members and of course card members value at the more we can customize for them, what we offer them and of course we are getting better that every month including using your location to be very specific to what we offer you. And we have seen growing interest on the part of merchants in using that eco system to help them drive business. So we are I think quite excited about our ability to continue to expand our efforts in this area and our ability to use it is one of the many key tenets we have to create value across our entire network of both card members and merchants. \nSameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets: Okay and then I'm getting a little bit specific here, but just on a different note here with your EveryDay preferred credit card, you're referred to this program. And I was looking at some of the rewards associated with the preferred card and they do seem somewhat rich depending on how you use them. But is this a sign because I think some other card issuers also have been ramping up the rewards if you will and some of the card offer, Wells Fargo is clearly indicated they want to grow their card business. So I mean Is this a sign that we are seeing competition at this point now that is going to eventually just reduce the profitability, the products across the board or do you see these are just very specific to certain target demographic and so as a result of that we shouldn't read into this more broadly that there will be rational competition?\nJeff Campbell : Well, certainly I guess I made the couple of points. One, remember that our goal is to engage our card members in the reward program because that is really how we generate the most loyalty, the most spend and the best bottom line result. So feel an irony here is as a general statement it can be a very positive thing for us when our rewards expand goes up. We've also done a lot of work over the last years and you continue to see as every quarter really expand the range of redemption offers because people have lots of different preferences and lots of different likes and dislikes and we have found great receptivity amongst our card members to that growing range of offers, which I think someone may trying to do the kind of comparison you just described. A little trickier because you don't necessarily know the redemption pattern and some ways you can look at our rewards cost each quarter. And that does give you a macro view of how it is trending relative to billings. On EveryDay preferred, clearly we think we have a proposition here that is going to be very attractive to a segment of the market that fits our long standing risk profile that we are after but frankly a segment of the market we probably didn't have the right product for it. And certainly offering the right product to that demographic has to include having a competitive set of rewards, but I guess I will be a little cautious about extrapolating from that one data point anything overly broad about rewards in general. \nJeff Campbell : I think operator we probably have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question will come from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Please go ahead\nDaniel Furtado - Jefferies and Company : Great. Thank you for the opportunity here. Earlier in the prepared remarks you said you were working on products that are more welcoming and more inclusive. And focusing on new customer segments. The way a layman should read this is simply that you're looking to move slightly down the credit spectrum as the economy has improved or how should we read those comments?\nJeff Campbell : Well, I don't if I used focus on the word credit. I like to think as I said if you look at this company over the last 30-40 years, we started out with a credit card with target our charge card, that was targeted in a very, very small group of customers who travel a lot in State at certain types of hotel. And there has been a steady evolution over decade of us moving beyond that initial very narrow customer demographic, moving beyond the very narrow merchant demographic and moving towards EveryDay spend, moving towards the broader customer base, we added lend products etcetera. And so when we look at things like the EveryDay card, the prepaid products, and the OptBlue program to expand merchant coverage, all of those things to us a part of long running trend in this company to extend the franchise and the brand which we think is so powerful. But that doesn't mean that we are changing the risk profile or the credit profile of the company. We think it means having the right product for different parts of the market. And matching that with ways that we provide value and merchant. So I -- yes we feel real opportunity here to continue to expand the footprint of our brand but this is not about changing our risk profile. For the EveryDay card, this is for people who already would have qualified for other products. And frankly we didn't really have a product that they thought was relevant for them. That's what we are trying to do. \nDaniel Furtado - Jefferies and Company : Okay, great. Thank you for the opportunity. That was my only question. \nJeff Campbell : So thank you all for your time and your interest in American Express. Have a good evening. \nOperator: Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host, Ted of Investor Relations, Mr. Toby Willard, please go ahead sir.\nToby Willard: Thanks so much. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our Web site at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Ken Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and will be joined by Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Once they complete their remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.\nKen Chenault: Thanks, Toby and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We have a lot to cover with you today, including a review of our fourth quarter and update on the Costco portfolio sale, and our outlook for 2016 and 2017. I'm joining the call today as I thought it was important to share my thoughts on the financial outlook and the evolving operating environment. Before Jeff begins, let me acknowledge that the performance we're discussing today is not what we or you are accustomed to say from American Express, and that we are taking significant actions to change the trajectory of our business going forward. During our remarks, we'll address three main questions. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? Why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term? So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well. Thanks, and good afternoon everyone. To answer the question Ken just posed, I'm going to start by explaining our 2015 results. How they've impacted our view of the future, and how they reflect the actions we are taking. I'll also acknowledge upfront that across all the periods we're discussing, there are a large number of items adding complexity to our results. We've provided some normalizations to help you better understand the underlying performance trends. I'll start on Page 2. Our fourth quarter and full year performance reflected the strength and the headwinds that we've been managing throughout 2015 versus the prior year on a reported basis the billings were up 2% for both the quarter and the prior year. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q4, which was consistent with the prior quarter and slightly below the full year growth rate as billings did decelerate modestly during the second half of the year. During the quarter, revenues were down 8% year-over-year and were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar and the gain from the sale of our investment in Concur during the prior year. Excluding FX and the Concur gain, adjusted revenue growth was relatively consistent sequentially at 4% during the quarter. This was also in line with our adjusted full year performance of 4%. Earnings per share are $0.89 in the quarter and $5.05 for the year, and included a charge in our Enterprise Growth business, which was driven primarily by the impairment of goodwill and technology together with some restructuring charges. Excluding this charge, adjusted EPS would have been $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.38 for the full year, down 3% from last year\u2019s EPS of $5.56, which did include a net gain of about $0.10 on the global business travel and Concur transactions. This performance is slightly above the high-end of the earnings range we provided on the Q3 earnings call, with the favorability primarily driven by our continued focus on operating expenses. In terms of key drivers for the year, our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card acquisitions, excellent credit performance, disciplined operating expense controls, and the benefits of our strong capital position. In particular, the accelerated new card acquisitions, loan growth, and expense control, all stemmed from actions we took in late-2014 and throughout 2015, as it became clear that the environment was evolving and all these actions should further help us 2016 and beyond. But these positives were challenged by several factors. First, the cumulative impact from the early renewals of our co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, and Iberia, along with the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, reduced EPS in the quarter and the year by approximately 5%. So we are done lapping these changes as we enter 2016. Second, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen as the year progressed, reducing EPS by another approximately 3% to 4% for both the quarter and the year. At current rates, the dollar will now represent a headwind for us as we enter 2016. Third, our decision to increase spending on growth initiatives for the year remaining at the elevated levels we were at in 2014 further pressured our earnings in 2015 and we now intend to stay at these levels throughout 2016, before returning to lower levels in 2017. And last, the economic, regulatory, and competitive environments, all became even more challenging as the year progressed. The combination of these factors resulted in our billings and revenue growth rates being fairly steady throughout the year, whereas we had expected to see a sequential strengthening. Despite these challenges, we leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and again returned over $5 billion of capital through buybacks and dividends during 2015, which reduced our average share count by 5%. These results also brought our reported return on equity for the period ending December 31st to 24% excluding the enterprise growth charge, our adjusted ROE was 26% to slightly above our target and illustrates the continued strength of our business operations. Let\u2019s now go through the components of results beginning with Billed business performance by region and segment which is on Slides 3 and 4. Billed business growth was 5% on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter, consistent with Q3 and below the full year number of 6%. Overall, our billings growth rate decelerated modestly during 2015, while we had anticipated a sequential strengthening. Although, this is disappointing, we did see positive momentum in certain segments. International performance excluding Canada continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX adjusted basis versus the prior year during Q4. I\u2019d note that Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4 2014 in advance of the termination of our relationship with them as of the end of 2014. Therefore, the drag on our ICS growth rate from Canada was smaller this quarter and we will fully lap this impact during the first quarter of 2016. GNS remained our fastest growing segment with volumes increasing 14% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis powered by continued strong performance in China, Korea, and Japan. In the USCS segment, billings growth remained consistent sequentially 5% despite further softening in billings on the Costco co-brand product, where volumes this quarter dropped more significantly versus the prior year. I\u2019d also note that lower gas prices continue to be a drag on USCS growth as average prices were down 24% versus the prior year. GCS billed business growth continued to slow and volumes were flat versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis during the fourth quarter. Performance continues to be impacted by lower airline volumes in a generally cautious corporate spending environment. Looking forward into 2016, we expect to see a modest uptick in billings growth rates beginning in the first quarter as we lap some of the headwinds we faced in early 2015 and as our initiatives to drive growth have more impact. Obviously, our billings growth rates during the second half of the year will be impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. around mid-year. Turning to loan performance on Slide 5, loans were down 17% on a reported basis, but this is entirely related to the reclassification of a portion of our loans to held-for-sale effective December 1st. We now expect the sale of JetBlue loan portfolio to occur during Q1 and I'll provide more details on the status of our Costco portfolio sale discussions later in my remarks. Excluding the held-for-sale portfolios from the prior year, worldwide loans were up 7% and U.S. loans were up 10% versus the prior year. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, international loan growth also remained strong at 10% during Q4. So we are pleased with the underlying trends in loan growth and that our increased investments and efforts to grow loans since earlier 2015 are already having an impact. Looking forward, we expect to see strong growth in loans held for investment and continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the Company. I'll also remind you that net interest income this quarter made up only 18% of our total revenues. Even if we continue to grow our loan portfolio at the higher rate you have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend focused given the expected reduction in loans associated with the co-brand relationships which are ending this year. Moving to our revenue performance on Slide 6, reported revenues were down for the full year and quarter driven by the prior year Concur gain and changes in FX. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 4% during the quarter which was consistent with our full year performance. Looking at our major revenue drivers, discount revenue was down 1% during the quarter, which was relatively consistent with our full year performance. During the quarter, our discount rate declined by 2 basis points versus the prior year driven impart by the continued roll out of OptBlue. Going forward, we anticipate that our discount rate will decline by a greater amount during 2016 due to the continued expansion of OptBlue, a greater impact from international regulatory changes and continued competitive pressures. Moving to our other primary revenue driver, growth in net interest income remained strong at 9%, it\u2019s modestly higher than our full year performance. Performance continues to be driven by strong loan growth. Stepping back, while revenue growth did not accelerate sequentially as we anticipated through the year, we were still able to consistently generate adjusted revenue growth of 4% even in a challenging environment. Going forward, subject to FX and economic trends, we believe that our efforts are focused in the right areas to drive acceleration in our revenue growth rate. Turning to credit performance on Slide 7, our provision was down 2% versus the prior year as lending write-off rates remained at lower levels. Our write-off rates remained the lowest among large peer issues. I'd note that the reclassification of a portion of our loans this quarter to held-for-sale had a small impact on provision, but did not significantly change our performance trends or reported credit metrics. Going forward, the continued growth in loans will contribute to an increase in provision as we expected since we first provided our multiyear outlook last year. We also expect to see some upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic performance. Moving to expense performance on Slide 8, total expenses were up 1% in the quarter and down 1% for the year, but were influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Overall, we continue to be very disciplined about controlling expenses, but recognize that we will need to be even more aggressive going forward as evidenced by the $1 billion target to reduce our overall cost base announced in today's press release. Looking at the quarter's results, marketing and promotion expenses ramped up to $892 million, which was similar to the prior year as we also had an elevated level of spending during Q4 '14 due to the Concur gain. As we discussed, another one of the key areas of focus for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. consumer small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter, which remained well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. Now obviously this is a very early cycle for our investors and it will take time for the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our performance. Turning to rewards, expenses were down 5% in the current quarter driven by $109 million impact in the prior year related to the renewal of our relationship with Delta. Our renewed co-brand relationships continued to have a significant impact on the cost of card member services, which was up approximately 20% versus the prior year during both Q4 and the full year. We will have lapped this as we head into 2016. One last item I\u2019d highlight is the tax rate, which was 38.2% in the quarter and significantly above the full year rate due to the enterprise growth charge, majority of which was not tax deductible. Looking forward into 2016 excluding the impact of discrete items, we believe that our underlying tax rate will be closer to the 34% to 35% range if it's trending to prior to this quarter. While there were a number of items that impacted year-over-year growth in operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses were down 2% for the full year and were up 2% after adjusting for FX. Both of these results are below our 3% operating expense target and impart reflect actions we took at the end of 2014 and throughout 2015 as we observed that the environment was evolving. We have a long track-record of taking cost actions when needed and looking forward we plan to take a series of additional aggressive actions which we expect will result in restructuring charges during 2016, and drive benefits in 2017 and beyond. Now shifting to our capital performance on Slide 10. During the current quarter, we returned over 150% of the capital regenerated to shareholders, while maintaining our strong capital ratios. During full year 2015, we returned over $5 billion of capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year and continued to increase our dividend, which is now approximately 60% higher than it was in 2011. Our full year payout ratio of 105% reflects our confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, as well as our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. So let me now shift to a discussion of our negotiation efforts on the Costco portfolio sale and our 2016 to 2017 financial outlook. As we mentioned in our press release and 8-K last Friday, given the progress on our portfolio sale discussions, we are now reporting the Costco portfolio as held-for-sale in a separate line on our balance sheet. Given this progress and given the importance of the transaction to our 2016 outlook, we have decided to provide a substantive update on the status of the anticipated transaction today. Clearly, since the agreement is not final, the update is subject to change. But we believe an agreement consistent with what I will outline will be signed in the near future. We now expect there to be a sale and for that sale to close around midyear 2016. And we expect that our merchant acceptance agreement will extend through the transaction close. In addition, as you would expect, we will continue to hold the co-brand loans and co-brand card members will also be able to use their cards at any AmEx accepting merchants through the transaction close date. We will be paid a premium on the assets when the transaction closes. The ultimate gain will be determined based on the assets actually sold. But we currently estimate a gain of approximately $1 billion. We have not yet signed a definitive agreement, and given that we are still several months away from the close and the card member borrowing and pay down trends are difficult to predict in this type of transition, the final gain could differ from our estimates. So now that we\u2019ve concluded 2015 and progressed in our portfolio sale discussions, we can provide additional clarity on our 2016 and 2017 EPS outlook. Because year-over-year growth rates during this period will be complicated by the number and timing of the moving pieces in our results, we have focused on the absolute dollar amount of earnings we are targeting in H2. That said, we have not seen volume and revenue growth accelerate as we expected over the past year. And the competitive, economic, and regulatory environment has become more challenging. As a result, we have become more cautious in our outlook and now expect our earnings per share during 2016 to be between $5.40 and $5.70. This now includes a substantial benefit from the portfolio sale gain and the incremental economics associated with the Costco contract extension and also includes the incremental spending on growth initiatives that they are helping fund. This range excludes the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. This is clearly a change in our expectations. I can assure you though that we are acting with a strong sense of urgency and confidence and executing on our plans to accelerate revenue growth and even more aggressively reduce our cost base. To help drive revenue growth, we plan to maintain our spending across a range of business opportunities during 2016 at similarly elevated levels to 2015. I emphasize that while the gain from the portfolio sale will impact us only in the quarter we close the transaction, the increased spending on growth initiatives will occur in all four quarters, resulting in some unevenness in our quarterly performance. On cost, as we moved through 2015 and gained more clarity on the portfolio sale, as well as our revenue growth outlook, it became clear that we needed to accelerate and expand our cost reduction efforts to right-size our cost base with the evolving business environment. As a result, we've launched cost initiatives that are designed to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base, which includes total operating expenses plus marketing and promotion cost by the end of 2017. To put this into perspective, since 2007 our billed business volumes have grown by over 60%, but our adjusted operating expenses are almost flat over that period. We achieved this disciplined cost control by continuously taking actions to increase the overall efficiency of our organization. Looking forward, we determined that those actions were no longer enough and that we needed to be even more aggressive on eliminating cost which is why we are targeting a $1 billion cost reduction. We plan to take actions throughout 2016 to drive these benefits in 2017 and beyond, which we expect to result in restructuring charges this year. So if you step back and think about our 2016 EPS guidance versus 2015, there are several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will grow based on our financial model of revenue growth which we believe should accelerate to 2015 levels, while with operating expense leverage and capital returns. Second, the portfolio sale gain will be partially used to fund a continued elevated level of spending on growth initiatives. Last, when the Costco volumes go away at midyear, the marginal contribution will fall away immediately, but we will need to maintain certain costs all the way into the first quarter of 2017 to ensure strong customer service. In addition, given the slower than anticipated overall revenue growth we saw in 2015, we will also need to remove more cost to offset the lower revenue which will take some time. Turning to capital, the portfolio sale will increase our capital ratios to a significant reduction in risk related assets. We plan to leverage this additional capital flexibility to support business building opportunities including growth in the loan portfolio and potential strategic acquisitions. As you're aware, we have been aggressive historically in our capital request through the CCAR process. Consistent with this approach, we plan to consider the opportunity for incremental capital returns related to the portfolio sale as part of our 2016 CCAR submission. Turning to 2017, we're now targeting to earn at least $5.60 per share. If you step back and think about this versus our 2016 EPS guidance there are again several key items impacting the year-over-year results. First, we expect the underlying business will again grow based on our simple financial model of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and capital returns. Second, we will have to lap the portfolio sale gain along with half year of getting the marginal contribution from the Costco business. Third, our more aggressive cost reduction efforts will be gaining traction, reducing our operating expense versus the 2015 adjusted base of $11.3 billion by at least 3%. And last, our spending on growth initiatives will be lower based on the changes we are making to drive further revenue growth more efficient. Looking beyond 2017, because there are so many moving pieces in the near-term, it's difficult to project when we might return to our consistent 12% to 15% earnings per share growth range. And we point out however that to achieve our 2017 target of $5.60 per share, the core will have to be growing at a healthy rate and overall, we believe the 12% to 15% EPS growth is still an appropriate long-term target for the organization. We recognize that we're operating a new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth. Now let me turn it back over to Ken, so he can provide some additional context.\nKen Chenault: Thank you, Jeff. And now that Jeff has taken you through our financial outlook, let me come back to the questions I set out at the start of the call. Why has our view of 2016 and 2017 changed? What are we doing about it? And why are we confident in our ability to grow over the moderate to long-term? To give context, our performance comes against the backdrop of changes that are reshaping the payments industry. These include a reset in co-brand economics, regulatory and competitive pressure on merchant fees and intense competition for customers. A number of cyclical factors in the broader economy also weighed on our 2015 performance and influenced our outlook for 2016 and 2017. As Jeff said, the economic headwinds we sighted last year including the stronger U.S. dollar and lower gas prices have lasted longer than we previously said. This is a long list of challenges, longer than we've seen in a number of years, we recognize them, we've been addressing them with a strong sense of urgency and we're making progress on many fronts. Over the past 12 to 18 months, we took decisive actions in the co-brand space, accelerating contract talks with partners, we focused on those where we can earn attractive returns and provide strong customer value, which led us to deals with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Air and Charles Schwab. We contained operating expenses and restructured many areas of our business. Now we\u2019re set to take cost reduction to the next level through our Billion Dollar Improvement program. We ramped up spending on card member acquisition and brought in 7.7 million new cards in the U.S. last year. Our investments here are paying off, and we\u2019re now focused on turning those new accounts into additional volumes. We stepped up investments in our international business with strong results, adjusted billed business rose by 12% last year. We expanded our merchant network, adding more than 1.2 million new merchants globally in the past year, with our OptBlue program we\u2019re continuing our efforts to move toward parity coverage with the other card networks in the U.S. We grew our lending business faster than the market, while maintaining our industry-best credit performance. We\u2019ll continue to target new lending prospects and deepen relationships with current customers. We expanded our digital capabilities with new apps and partnerships to better serve our customers. We streamlined our management structure, creating integrated consumer, commercial and merchant teams to accelerate growth. And taking advantage of our financial strength, we\u2019ve returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders last year. Although, 2015 was challenging, we did accomplish a lot. However, let me be clear, we need to accelerate our efforts and we have a plan to do just that. It includes three priorities; accelerate revenue growth; reduce our expense base and optimize our investments; and continue to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders. Let me start with expenses and give you a little more context. In 2013, we set a goal to limit OpEx growth to 3% or less. We beat that goal every year since then. To do this, we took a number of restructuring actions that provided benefits in 2015 and will continue to aid us in 2016. The plan we announced today is a major step up from there. It targets reducing our overall cost base by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Along the way, we intend to see operating expenses decline by at least 3% from our 2015 base in 2017. And we expect to see the full benefit in our run rate by the beginning of 2018. This will involve restructuring actions to streamline the Company starting in the first quarter of this year. I\u2019ve assigned our Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri to lead the effort. He\u2019ll work with me and our senior leaders in every area of our business to ensure we move quickly and meet our goals. Steve is one of our most accomplished leaders. He\u2019s been at the forefront of campaigning our operating expenses over the past several years and has an outstanding track-record of making the organizations he\u2019s led more efficient and more effective. As this new effort advances, we\u2019ll be taking actions to reduce cost in a thoughtful way, without compromising our ability to serve our customers, meet our compliance obligations, and grow the business. We have a strong history of meeting our reengineering commitments and I am confident we\u2019ll do it again. At the same time, we\u2019re also focused on optimizing our investments. We\u2019ll continue to use Big Data analytics to improve the way we evaluate, prioritize and execute our investment opportunities. We\u2019ll gain efficiencies from our new management structure and we\u2019ll stop certain initiatives where we\u2019re not seeing results or a clear path to results just as we did by refocusing in our price growth, using our investment dollars more efficiently should help us as we move toward a lower level of investment spending in 2017. As we work to accelerate revenues, we\u2019ll be focused on the opportunity I cited earlier. We\u2019ll invest to grow our card member base and merchant network, deepen customer relationships through lending and rewards, increase our international presence, grow our commercial payments business, and develop newer adjacent opportunities like our Loyalty Coalition business. In addition to organic growth, we\u2019ll continue to explore opportunities to grow through acquisitions. Even with the challenges we faced in 2015, we continue to see underlying growth in the business. Adjusted revenues rose 4% for the year and we\u2019re confident that we can improve upon this performance. We have a tremendous set of assets to draw upon; our trusted brand, financial strength, the advantages of our closed loop, world-class customer service, and our proven ability to innovate. Our integrated payments model runs about $1 trillion in spending through our closed loop each year. That rich data enables us to create value for card members and build the business for our merchant partners. This is a major advantage and that\u2019s one reason why other card issuers are trying to cobble together a closed loop on their own despite only having a portion of the essential data. We're not simply looking to do a better job of processing payments, we're focused on using our relationships, technology and data to better serve our customers and open up commerce opportunities for our partners. As the boundaries between online and offline blur, I believe our business model puts us in a great position to benefit from the conversions of payments and commerce. We have a deep and experienced management team to guide us forward. They've been tested by major challenges many times over the years and our Company has always emerged stronger. You'll hear more about our plans to drive growth from Steve Squeri, Anr\u00e9 Williams and Doug Buckminster as well as Jeff and me during Investor Day on March 10th. Let me conclude by saying, we recognize that we're operating in a new reality. That's why we're focused on the plan I outlined to increase revenues, reduce cost and optimize our investments. We're confident that we can deal with our near-term challenges, return to growth and position the Company for long-term success. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Ken. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session. Therefore, before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process. With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions, operator.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Vendetii: Yes Jeff, can you confirm in terms of the '16 guidance, do you have an incremental payout ratio assumed in there from the gain or do you not have that built in yet?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think Don it's fair to say we take our best shot at estimating what we think a reasonable capital return is based on our view of our capital strength and our opportunities. Of course as you well know we'll have to see if the Fed agrees with this, but certainly what we have built-in is what we think is a very healthy return on capital.\nDon Vendetii: Right, and then of 1 billion of expense cuts, clearly the Costco is a big piece of the portfolio 20%, you'd expect some cost reduction from that. Can you sort of help us think about how much of the billion is sort of Costco related versus sort of core business?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the way I guess I would answer that Don and I'd remind you Costco is 20% of our loans and look our net interest income is only about 18% of our income statement so they are about 8% of our billings for the co-brand, another 1% for other merchant acceptance. I think the broader way to really think about it is that as Ken said in his remarks, we recognize that there are many things that have changed in the environment we are in and as we have gone through 2015, we have not seen the revenue acceleration that we had expected to see. If you go back to our Investor Day in March, if you go back to the original conference call we did last February when Ken and I talked about our decision to walk away from the Costco agreement, we said we're going to have to see how much other volumes ramp-up and what the pace is of that ramp and exactly what the final outcome is of when the Costco portfolio goes away and in what way, well we have those answers now and when you put all of that together with the evolving environment that we are in we concluded we need to be much more aggressive about all aspects of our cost base. So I don\u2019t think Don you can really attribute it to any one factor, it's the confluence of all the things that Ken and I talked about this afternoon.\nKen Chenault: Yes, I would just add to what Jeff said is that, one we recognized early that the economics of the co-brand marketplace were changing and certainly that competitor pressures throughout the industry were likely to increase and that's one of the reasons Don that we initiated two separate restructuring initiatives in 2014 which was well before we knew how our Costco negotiations would come out and I think those initiatives certainly helped us to hold OpEx growth below our target again flat in 2015. Then in February as we talked about, we recognized that the termination of the Costco relationship was going to create a short-term volume and revenue gap and that's why we said it's possible that we take an additional restructuring charge. We know what the situation is now, but that also would be based impart on the revenue and volumes growth that we saw in other parts of our business. And as Jeff said in his opening remarks, the revenue and billings growth is not accelerated as we would have expected and so we're working to right-size the course of the cost base, there are variable costs that we can take out relatively quickly, but there are fixed costs as well and that's going to take time to transition, but I think that the reengineering plan that we have put in place gives us a lot of confidence that we can realize the cost objectives that we have put in place and we can do it in a way that is not going to impair our ability very importantly to build on the range of growth opportunities that we\u2019ve identified.\nOperator: Thank you. Out next question that will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Okay Mr. Bruce, your line is open. Please check your mute key.\nKen Bruce: Encouraging on the card acquisitions in the quarter and the year, I guess as you\u2019ve been looking at what is kind of the center piece of that growth is that coming from premium cards, credit cards, star cards. Could you give us any sense as to what is underlying that growth please?\nJeff Campbell: I think Ken what is very pleasing to us and this goes back to the broad range of opportunities set we have, we clearly are pleased with the growth we\u2019re seeing in against premium cards. We also have a very good small business franchise. International, as we\u2019ve said, is performing well for us. Certainly what we are benefiting from is to have a variety of card growth initiatives. So very frankly it is really across the board that we\u2019re seeing this card acquisition growth. And certainly the point that we have emphasized, it\u2019s one thing to get the cards and we\u2019re excited and we think we\u2019re getting the right types of cards. But we also have a demonstrated track-record of in fact generating spending on those cards. And that\u2019s very important. But what I would say, the headline would be that we feel very good about the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the franchise.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I want to reconcile the commentary on the weaker revenue growth trajectory into 2016 and 2017. I guess we knew kind of the co-brand reset and the regulatory backdrop and I understand the economic environmental a bit weaker. But is it really mainly coming from the competitive environment affecting the business? And maybe you could just specifically talk about what\u2019s changed over the last three to six months, that\u2019s really affecting your outlook. And then when we think about strategic acquisitions, maybe you can just talk about what you guys are anticipating in terms of size and where exactly an acquisition might fit into the business? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Sanjay let me just go back and explain how things have evolved over the last year and then Ken you might want to provide a little broader context. As you think about the course of 2015, we clearly did have an expectation that you would a significant sequential strengthening in both volumes and revenues. And as we went through the year that clearly did not happen. As we thought about that Sanjay in the context of our forward outlook, at some point when revenues weaken a little bit, as you know we have a financial model that has lots of levers and we can pull those levers at different times. With regards to the end of the year though and looked at a full year revenue growth not being where we thought it would be, we concluded it didn\u2019t make sense to pull the levers as hard as we would have had to pull them to get to where we had hoped to get to in 2016 and \u201917. And so we\u2019ve adjusted course. So I think there is many-many drivers of that slower revenue growth which Ken and I tried to get in our remarks, but Ken you probably want to provide a little broader context.\nKen Chenault: Yes I would, I think what\u2019s important is while certainly Sanjay the revenues and the volumes are not where we want them to be. I would just go back if we look at the competitive environment and look at the large issuers. We are at least generating an adjusted 4% growth rate against the backdrop of a more challenging economic environment. And as we have continued to maintain over the last several years a intensifying competitive environment, what we\u2019ve seen from our large issuing peers is despite the investments they\u2019re making and the billings growth, they\u2019re not achieving much revenue growth. So our revenue growth is certainly better I\u2019d like it in fact to be accelerated and we believe it will in 2015. I think again the investments that we\u2019ve made in card acquisitions have frankly been performing in general in line with our expectations. Now, we are constantly reviewing our investment alternatives and while allocating those dollars, we believe we can generate the best returns. And I think as we\u2019ve said when some of those initiatives are not working enterprise growth was an example of that. What I\u2019ve also been pleased with is the increasing way that we are using our technology and our data analytics to improve our marketing programs and to make them more effective. So I think there is always some lead time as we have talked about between when we are making investments and when we see the returns, but I think it's not just the sign post that we've seen in card in bringing in new cards, but it's also some of the sign posts that we're seeing in some of the services and capabilities that we're providing something like pay with points which we're seeing from a standpoint of young people there is an attraction and engagement to those programs. I think what we've done with some of our digital partnerships I think the progress that we've made with OptBlue and then I go back to what I think has been very strong performance in a range of international markets. So I think that that's the balance.\nJeff Campbell: Can I just kind of summarize, if you think about 2015 Sanjay you had oil that kept going lower, you had FX that kept going against us, the economy was weaker than people thought and you have accumulative impact of regulation and competition. All that said, as we get into 2016 for all the reasons Ken talked about, our expectation and you should expect to see some acceleration in our volume and revenue growth trends beginning in the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Ken we don\u2019t often get you on a call, so I think a long-term question seems appropriate, historically AmEx has been a trade of premium to peers due to its spend centric discount revenue having modeled. Now we're hearing about ramped up pressure on the discount rate and aggressive lending growth against a backdrop. As an industry quickly moving toward giving up interchange economics to drive loan growth and share gains, so my real question is concerning the competitive backdrop and the change in how your competitors are looking at their economics, how can you maintain the model long-term that has traditionally allowed AmEx to be valued at a premium to competitors?\nKen Chenault: Well I think that's Craig a multi-layered question, so let me hit it on some different pathways as we go forward. I think one is if you look at the issuing side of the business and you focus on the spend centric versus the lend centric, I go back to a point that Jeff made in talking about the fourth quarter results and certainly we have said this in the past, if you look at net interest income as a percentage of revenues that range is around 15% to 20%, in the fourth quarter it was 18%. So at the end of the day, the progress that we're making on lending and I should add to that growing better than the industry with industry leading credit performance and I think we're getting good spending on those cards, I think that is working well for us as I look at it on the issuing path. So I feel pretty good about the viability of our spend centric model. The second thing that I would say is that the nature of just focusing on specific customer segments and just focusing on one geography in the U.S. so what's interesting is when you look at small business and I think you know this in 2014 $4.8 trillion were spent by small businesses, but only 10% of that was on plastic and where we are the market leader in small business. So I think that it's not just the payment industry dynamics that we're competing with in this case, we're competing against cash checks and the fact that only 10% of 4.8 trillion is on plastic suggests there's a strong opportunity, I can do the same thing in middle market. Then I go to international and I look at a range of markets where the penetration against plastic is relatively low and we've actually achieved pretty good growth rate, so 12% in billings growth in a number of markets we're growing faster than the market. So I think when you look at the breadth of our portfolio in consumer, small business and corporate and the geographic and the fact that we are competing also against cash and checks. That gives me some confidence relative to both the growth and the economics. Now I will absolutely admit that's why I started off, there's a reset on co-brand economics. That certainly is a challenge, but we are not overly dependent on co-brands and we have a range of opportunities that we are pursuing. On the merchant side, let's be very clear Visa and MasterCard have different models at this point in time those models are working pretty well for them, but as I look at our opportunities going forward, I think there is a sea change going on in payments and commerce. So certainly they provide an important part of the payments process, but I think increasingly it's going to be very important to have direct relationships with consumers and merchants and we think direct relationships in the inside, the information that we have from card members and merchants is going to be even more valuable as the convergence of online and offline commerce continues. And so building on the relationships inherent in our integrated model provides the foundation we think to deliver strong value to our shareholders. So I think that that is going to be an important development as we go forward. What I would also say is that when you look at the value that we provide and certainly regulation is playing a role in the merchant business. But I do want to avoid sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Visa and MasterCard rate structure, which is enormously complicated and that varies significantly by product. And I would say that our merchant rates really do reflect the value that we provide. And so the fact that as you know card member spending is 3 to 4 times the amount on Visa and MasterCard, I think Visa has consistently increased their prices in the nation groups and that obviously is a dynamic there. But when I relate that to the importance of how we drive value going forward and direct relationships that we have with the end-user customer and the merchant and the changes in commerce, I think that we have the ability to compete. So you\u2019ve got to look at the breadth of the portfolio and the number of levers that we have to pull.\nOperator: Our next question in queue will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: I guess I was struck by the comment that you expect that in 2017 the level of marketing and rewards could be reduced as you kind of lap some of those investments. You talked about how much that could be. And maybe relate the level of rewards that are on the cards that you\u2019re offering to these new consumers to what your current cost of rewards is?\nJeff Campbell: All right Moshe to be clear rewards were not what I was referencing. What we\u2019re talking about is when you look across the range of things we spend in the market and promotional area and the operating expense area. When we look at our evolving digital acquisition, our evolving use of Big Data, when we look at certain markets, Ken just talked about the breadth of our business model where in fact we\u2019re increasingly finding the use of direct salesforces to be a more effective way to grow than certain of our more traditional marketing and promotional efforts, we absolutely look at that from our marketing and promotional line and see a pathway to moderate down the level of spend without losing any ability to grow revenues. And so as we think about taking the billion dollars out of the cost base, we very consciously have said while the majority of that will certainly come out of operating expenses. There are instances where in fact it makes more economic sense for us to pull down marketing and promotional expenses and actually grow operating expenses. And we want the flexibility to do the right thing to drive revenue growth going forward.\nKen Chenault: I\u2019d just say two or three things Jeff, is one what we\u2019ve seen on the operating expense side if I just take small business and middle market what we\u2019ve seen is the expansion of our salesforce the return on that has been substantial even though that adds to OpEx that is a very-very good trade-off that we want to make. But I just come back on the rewards point because there\u2019re different categories of rewards. There is cash back, there is co-brands and the reality is if you look at how we\u2019ve managed the cost for example of membership rewards I think we\u2019ve been able to manage those costs very well. When we look at the engagement of our customers on membership rewards, it\u2019s been very strong. So I mentioned that that segment of 30 and under is very attracted to pay with points. And so the deals we\u2019ve done with Airbnb and Uber are very attractive to that segment. And one of the reasons why is because we have a program that\u2019s over 20 years old and in fact we have a very large number of points in our bank. So I think as with other categories, when you look at rewards, you\u2019ve got a segment and you\u2019ve got to look at the economics of cash back, you\u2019ve got to look at co-brands as we\u2019ve talked about and certainly the margins have been squeezed more in co-brands. But the fact that we have a very broad-based rewards program that we continue to evolve we\u2019ve made more digital, we\u2019ve made more mobile, I think gives us a flexibility in how we manage the overall reward gains of our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll move on to our next question and that will come from Bill Carache with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nBill Carache: Could you clarify for us the core EPS number, what that is for 2016 excluding any gain net of reinvestment? And the reason for the question is that some investors that we've spoken with are stripping out the $1 billion Costco gain or about $0.66 a share to get to kind of what they're calling a core EPS number for 2016. The math I've seen is people are using the midpoint of your 2016 guidance to get to above $4.89 that would imply negative 9% year-over-year growth for '16 and then they're comparing that to kind of what you had previously been guiding to the modestly positive EPS growth, I think consensus of about plus 2%. Maybe could you give a little bit of clarity around that, just so there's not I guess speculation around how much of '16 is being influenced by or I guess inflated by the gain?\nKen Chenault: Yes, so I think Bill the way to think about it is as I said in my remark, we are -- we will use the gain partially to remain at the more elevated level of growth oriented spending that we were at in 2015 and then in fact Moshe was just talking to us about in terms of how we will rationally pull it down through 2017. That is a change if I go back to the way we first talked about 2016 in February and March last year at our Investor Day, our assumption had been we will begin to moderate that growth oriented spending down in 2016. As the gain has come in as we've looked at all the things going on in the Company, we have made the decision that the right thing to do for the long-term is to stay at that higher level. Now in terms of the exact amount, I guess if there's a little bit of judgment Bill involved in that, certainly a very substantial piece of the gain is being used to keep our investments up at a higher level is it all the gain, probably not, is it the majority of the gain probably I'm hesitant to put a firm number on it because that's not reflective of how we run the Company, we look at the range of opportunities we have that we think make sense either shareholders' money on for the long-term we are funding those up very fully in 2016 and that soaks up a good portion of the gain. Yes the point I would make Jeff is that American Express has had a velocity of how we've used gains overtime and where we see growth opportunities and those of you who followed the Company for a while might recall that we had a fairly substantial gain over a multiyear period in the Visa MasterCard private action and so the damages claim was in I think the first amount charged was probably $1 billion I think it was $3 billion in total, I can't remember it exactly, but the reality is that we believe we had a range of opportunities to invest in growing our business middle market was an example and small business and I think what we demonstrated is we used those gains in a very-very productive way. So when I look at what we can do relative to adding new card members, deepening customer relationships from a lending, reward standpoint, we believe even though commercial payments had a slower year in 2015 we see that as an area for investment going forward. So this has been pretty consistent that where we have seen opportunities either to make investments in technology platforms or from a growth standpoint, we've done that and I think we've had a pretty good track-record of basically achieving the outcomes that we set out to.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question queued that will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: I guess two unrelated questions. Given everything that we're hearing in the economy around corporate, particularly the industrial economy, any material weakness that you're seeing across any sectors and I guess specific for you Ken given the planning you laid out today, can you just talk about how management incentives are aligned with delivering on the plan?\nKen Chenault: What I would say Ryan is our managements and it start with pay with performance and so what we have is very clear objectives around each of our businesses whether that's consumer, commercial, merchant, international. We obviously factor in what are some of the external factors that we need to weigh, but we have very clear objectives that we have set for the Company overall and for particular businesses. And I think we have a demonstrated track-record that we hold our people accountable. So what we have not had is a situation that someone simply says that it will be certainly will be reflected in our compensation is because it's a challenging economic environment that people get a pass that\u2019s not the way we operate as a Company. On the other side, there are different strategic initiatives and particular areas that we\u2019re going to make multiyear investments in and we established certain signposts to judge the effectiveness and the performance of those activities. And it is a very rigorous process that we very consistently review not only as a management team but with our Board and the comp committee in particular on a regular basis throughout the year.\nRyan Nash: And then just on the other part of the question, around what you\u2019re seeing from corporates any particular sectors of weakness?\nKen Chenault: I think as we\u2019ve said, hopefully we believe that we\u2019ll see some improvement but I think we\u2019ve been very clear throughout the year that I would say the segments that I\u2019ve been most disappointed in has been the corporate segment. And I think you have heard me say this before through the years that the easiest expense category to cut is T&E that\u2019s the first thing you see. Then you start to see people cutting on technology investments. And we hope that we\u2019ll see some improvements in that in 2016. But as I evaluate 2014, that was an area that in the beginning of the year we started off in a better place, and we saw a pretty consistent decline. And certainly what we\u2019ve seen in my 30 plus years experience with the Company is cut backs in T&E tends to be an early indicator for a slowdown. And I am not sure what will happen going forward. But what we do believe is we\u2019ll see some improvement in the growth in commercial in 2016.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: A question I guess Jeff you sounded pretty confident and Ken about accelerating growth in 2016 starting in the first quarter, that\u2019s kind of an unusual statement in an environment where the markets are very jittery about decelerating economic growth. What gives you confidence in seeing accelerating growth in 2016 to build it into your plan and even say that you would see it in the first quarter?\nKen Chenault: Well, I think I\u2019d maybe answer that in two parts. So something it closed in is the first quarter Bob you really look at just some of the things that is happening right. So, FX while still a headwind for us is not as big a headwind as you get into the first quarter. We\u2019ll see what happens with oil prices. A couple of weeks ago I would have told you I think they\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to get to a lapping point on oil prices although those have gotten a little bit of tougher. And then when you just look at some other things going on in our business including Costco Canada, the areas that we have been focused on throughout 2015 in terms of spending and the trends we\u2019re seeing, we do think that as soon as Q1 you should see some acceleration in the year-over-year volume trends that you\u2019ve been seeing. As you think more broadly across the year, I mean certainly we worry about all the same broad macroeconomic risks and trends that you talked about. But we are just balancing that against all the other things that we\u2019re doing to try to accelerate revenue growth. And the fact that 2015 was another year of not particularly great growth and yet we still got on an FX adjusted basis to 4% revenue growth and we think we can do better than that in 2016.\nBob Napoli: And are you counting on an acceleration in GDP growth to get to those numbers?\nKen Chenault: Yes, of course\u2026\nJeff Campbell: Not no, no.\nBob Napoli: And then you\u2019re clearly not seeing a deceleration then in the pieces of your business in line with some of the concerns you\u2019re not seeing strong trends necessarily but you\u2019re not seeing, you\u2019re not concerned about the U.S. economy going into recession for example?\nKen Chenault: Yes, here is what I would say, Bob, is we are not seeing decelerating trends. We\u2019re certainly not seeing in the overall economic catalyst that would say that we think there are going to be improvements in GDP growth. But I think the indicators that and the reasons that Jeff cited, we are really focused on our business model and the reasons why we think we\u2019ll see improved revenue growth. And I would keep it at that. I think as with most people, I don\u2019t think we are of the view that we're going to see a dramatic change in the improvement in the U.S. economy. We hope things hold and I would say we hope certainly I'm not predicting that things will get a little bit better, but I certainly would not bank our plan on seeing a dramatic improvement in GDP growth, that's certainly not an assumption at all that we are making for our plan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Ken you mentioned the acquisitions of the potential growth strategy earlier in the call and I just wanted to see if you could give us any color on the potential areas of focus. You also mentioned the importance of being closer to the merchant and I was wondering if you've ever looked at the private label space as the potential area of expansion anything closer to merchants through proprietary closed loop card within a merchant at this point? And sort of second question just clarify for '17 is there any anticipated impact in your guidance from Starwood and also from the European interchange reductions? Is that a net positive or a negative in your view? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Let me quickly Chris take the latter two and then Ken you should chat about the M&As. Question is certainly in '15 you see an impact from European deregulation because while we're not subject to the interchange caps the reality is as we've said for a while it puts some downward pressure on our discount rate as we really believe our merchants who saw that impact in '15 have to see a little bit more of it in '16 probably get -- need to get all the way to '17 before we fully lap that space into all of our thoughts. On Starwood, we'll have to see, we think we do a great job and have a great partner for Starwood we think we have a great partnership and I think SPG is one of the assets that Marriott is acquiring, but we'll have to see over the longer term exactly where Marriott decides to take the two programs. Yes, so I would just say on private label, I don\u2019t see that as an area that we're going to pursue. I think as we talked about there are aspects of non-card lending both in consumer and commercial that we're certainly taking a look at and I think we believe that we have a range of opportunities as we look at lending, we don\u2019t think we're getting our fair share of blend from existing customers that we have and we see that as an opportunity. I think that private label you got to think through the different cycles and as we look at the different cycles in private lending in private label lending, we actually think that we can have more balanced growth and have a more balanced risk profile in the way that we are conducting our lending strategy. I would just say to add a little bit on Starwood and then I'll talk about how we're looking at acquisitions overall that I would emphasize and I think it is certainly one of the reasons why Marriott made the deal is they were very-very focused on the high quality customer that Starwood has, SPG which is what their co-branded card is called is viewed very positively. You may or may not know when the deal was announced there was a lot of buzz on social media from the Starwood SPG customers saying we really love this product, there were a lot of good things said about AmEx. I had a lot of respect for the Marriott management and I think our job as we've been doing is to provide really-really strong value and if we do that, I think we're going to be fine, so that' what we're going to be focused on. On the acquisition side, the reality is as we look at a range of different opportunities, I think the loyalty partner example is a very good one. One we see it as a very manageable acquisition, but it also plays off a number of the capabilities and takes advantage of the merchant relationships that we have and what you know in the loyalty partner model that I think is quite attractive is the merchant actually funds the reward on loyalty partner. And so we're in the early stages as you know with the Plenti launch we actually announced I think it was two days ago that Chile's restaurant chain has come on and part of what you want with this program, we've got Macy's AT&T, ExxonMobil, nationwide a range of companies if you want to get people a range of redemption options where they can buy something in one place redeem somewhere else and having the different need categories and that is very important so we're very happy to have Chile's in the Plenti program. But I do think as we look at the merchant side, as we look at consumer, as we look at commercial, we think there are a range of opportunities of that obviously if we feel they\u2019re going to leverage some of the assets and capabilities or bring us some of the assets and capabilities what we would look as we looked at with loyalty partner is can they substantially improve the size and scale and the growth of those businesses. And so that\u2019s the philosophy that we\u2019re going to take from an acquisition standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Two related questions for guidance for 2016. Jeff I thought you said something about restructuring charges being part of expenses embedded in the guidance. I am wondering if you could quantify that at all. And then also on one of the sort of headwinds you\u2019re facing for 2016 on the regulation side. Is it all regulation like Europeans stuff that was just discussed? Or is it also the anti-trust litigation and an anti-steering rule sort of embedded in what you put under the heading of regulation? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So the specific things on regulation really that we\u2019re referring to Chris are around the European regulation, which went into effect in early December, as well as some new rulings in Australia and that will also impact our business. So that\u2019s really the main driver there. In terms of 2016 guidance to be very clear as we said in the press release our 5.40 to 5.70 range does not include any potential restructuring charges. I did say and I would expect that it is likely we will take restructuring charges in 2016, at this point while we have lots of work streams that have been underway for a while. We are not at the point where we can estimate those charges and therefore give you any sense of them, which is why we didn\u2019t feel comfortable trying to build it into any guidance. That said, if you might just if you look at history as Ken said earlier, we have over the last couple of years done a number of restructurings and those probably give you a reasonable range to think about.\nKen Chenault: The only other point Jeff I would make is obviously I think most people are aware of the second circuit court of appeals which issued an order granting a temporary stay of the trial court\u2019s injunction. And so what that means is as long as that order remains in effect, American Express is no longer subject to the trial court\u2019s injunction. And so that means that we are entitled to enforce the pre-injunction non-discrimination provisions. And so we\u2019re obviously awaiting the pallet court\u2019s decision which we don\u2019t know when will be coming out. But I think that was an important development that occurred towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ho: Obviously a lot of talk about what premium multiple or if that still exists versus other card issuers and specifically obviously you have a advantage on the spend centric model. But particularly have been rewarded for an above average growth rate versus peers. So if I think about your 12% to 15% target through the year, is it basically on an underlying basis it\u2019s not a realistic target for 2017 or is it and do you plan to provide additional visibility on the underlying growth rate of earnings maybe ex-Costco and a lot of the moving pieces from here through \u201917?\nJeff Campbell: So David, we will do everything we can. We did chose to go to absolute levels of EPS because there are so many moving pieces in our results as you go through the \u201915 to \u201916, to \u201917, time frame but it is very difficult I think for people to make sense of just talking about growth rates. As I said in my remarks so if you carefully do the math you only get to the at least 5.60 in earnings per share that we\u2019re targeting in 2017 if you have what I recall a very healthy core growth rate as you move from \u201916 to \u201917. In \u201915 alone and I would point out directing people through the math if you think about the 5% or so of EPS that\u2019s a co-brand reset cost that\u2019s which will lap, FX impact of 3% to 4% and then the $0.10 or so was about 2 points of EPS growth that 2014 had it as the net gain from chief global business travel and Concur transactions. So if you ended up with a core that\u2019s growing not quite where we would think a still appropriate consistent target is 12% to 15% but showing pretty good growth. And to get to that 2017 number you\u2019re going to have to better the math and get out the acceleration and revenue growth that Ken and I talked about. So to try to put a specific number on it, gets I think very confusing and you start to run together what\u2019s part of our billion dollar cost reduction versus normal OpEx leverage and that\u2019s -- it is a combination of those things that led us to say here is just the absolute numbers we think we can get to.\nKen Chenault: I think Jeff where it does go to is really the underlying strength of the business model. As you pointed out relative to the performance in 2015 and as we talked about what we see as the opportunity is going forward in 2016 and 2017.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCheryl Pate: I just wanted to sort of follow-up on the revenue growth question and spend a little bit more time on the MDR guidance and looking for that to be a little bit more severe compression than what we saw this year. Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces there in terms of relative impact? Is it coming more from the international piece, is it more OptBlue as that continues to build out? And sort of on the flip side of that as we talk about continuing to build out the acceptance piece, is there an acceleration in timeline as to when you expect to get to parity relative to Visa MasterCard?\nJeff Campbell: So, three things Cheryl on my specific comment that we do expect to see more year-over-year decline in the discount rates in 2016. The drivers are really just what you said; number one, OptBlue as we continue to build it out, the cumulative impact does grow a little larger as you get into 2016. We continue to believe that program is good for us economically. We passed the breakeven point in 2015 and we think we are making great progress in that program too. You do see a greater impact in 2016 from the regulation in Europe and its impact on merchant negotiations as I talked about earlier. And three, you do have some mix issues right. So in the first half of the year, oddly enough as we completely finish lapping Costco in Canada that was helping our year-over-year discount rate a little bit in 2015. As you have seen a little bit less growth in the corporate card business, that tends to be spending at a mix of merchants that tends to be a little bit higher in terms of discount rate and as growth in the U.S. has been a little slower than it has been historically, relative to the U.S. that also causes puts a little bit of pressure on the discount rates from a mix perspective. So it\u2019s all of those things that drove the comment I made about expecting a larger year-over-year discount rate decline in 2016. And then Ken you might want to comment and cover it up a little.\nKen Chenault: Yes, I mean the point I would make is Cheryl I can\u2019t give you a specific timeframe, but the farthest I\u2019ll go is to say it is several years, which certainly 10 years ago I wouldn\u2019t even come close to saying it\u2019s several years. I think we\u2019ve made some really strong progress I\u2019ve been pleased with the momentum that we\u2019ve seen with OptBlue I just reinforced what Jeff said is the growing mix of business within the retail and everyday sector is obviously very critical to the expansion of OptBlue and obviously some of the regulation that we\u2019re seeing in some of the key international markets. But as we\u2019ve talked about before, the increased coverage also has an impact on improving the perception of coverage which should help our growth. Now, that takes time for perception to catch up with reality. And to the earlier point that Jeff made if we can start to see some improvement in the corporate business, that\u2019s going to help. But we consciously understood that with expansion of OptBlue we were going to have a greater mix of retail and every day and that\u2019s something that we want to see because that increases the utility of our acquired products.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Togut with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: For 2016, could you please quantify the elevated spending on growth initiatives, break it down in each of the major buckets of spending. And then walk us forward into 2017 giving us a sense of how each of these major buckets of spending will change. And in particular I am wondering how you can reduce spending on these areas, particularly given the more competitive environment you talked about, a tougher economy and a tougher regulatory environment? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, David the shorter answer is no, I am not going to walk you through that level of detail because we would consider it competitively sensitive to be that precise about the areas we\u2019re targeting that there\u2019re opportunities and also because as the world changes, it\u2019s very important that we retain flexibility to react to the evolving environment and we go back to the things I talked about earlier, what makes us believe we can moderate spending without losing our ability to run revenues well it is due evolving use of Big Data, the growth in the percentage of our new card acquisitions that comes from digital channels that are very efficient and it's through focusing on the areas of greatest opportunity.\nKen Chenault: The only point I\u2019d make Jeff and I would say we\u2019re in an even better situation because of the progress we\u2019ve made on data analytics and performance marketing. But if we go back over the last 15 years, the reality is we\u2019ve gone through periods of elevated spending where we saw opportunities and then we\u2019ve reaped the benefits three, or four, or five years, down the road, even when we have moved down those level spending. So we have an opportunity and we\u2019re taking advantage of it. And I would say the analytics and the capabilities that we\u2019ve developed give me confidence that we\u2019ll take advantage of those opportunities and the efficiencies that we have brought to bear in our business over the last several years have really produced good results. So we feel that that dynamic is something that we can continue. And we\u2019re going to continue to push very aggressively.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Aaron Rabinovich with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rabinovich: Just a point of clarification on the expenses, I think in Ken\u2019s remarks he said that you expect operating expenses to decline by at least 3% from the 2015 base. Is the 2015 base just your GAAP total which includes spending around 519 million of onetime charges just trying to get a better understanding of that?\nKen Chenault: Yes, so to be very precise think about 2015 base of 11.3 which takes out those doesn\u2019t really include the Q4 charge. And so as we think about the billion dollar cost target the reality is we\u2019ve done the easy stuff. It will take until the end of 2017 to get to a full run rate, but if you think about full year 2017 results, we should get at least down 3% below 2015.\nJeff Campbell: So operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir that will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Just one quick follow-up on Starwood, do you have any provisions in your program partnerships with, whether it\u2019d be a Starwood or a Delta that preclude or limit the co-brand partners\u2019 ability to dilute the value of the points by changing and, on our redemption options? And then just one follow-up on the guidance, what does it contemplate in terms of FX and provisions for 2016?\nKen Chenault: So we\u2019ll split this up, I\u2019ll do Starwood and I\u2019ll have Jeff talk about FX, obviously it would be totally inappropriate for me to go in to the terms of the contract. But what I would say that\u2019s very clear is that if you have a group of customers that in fact have relied on getting very strong value for a product, the last thing you want to do is diminish the value of the product. And as I said earlier, and not just from us but if you look at independent card surveys, the SBT product is one of the highest rated products from a value standpoint. So, I think that the Marriott people are very customer centric, very smart, and I don\u2019t think they would have done this deal if the objective was to dilute the value of products to some of their most important customers. So that would just be my perspective, I don\u2019t have any information from them there. But I do know in some of what I have read publicly they have talked about their excitement about having this size of customer and the value that they put on it. And so that would be my perspective.\nJeff Campbell: And on FX, our comments today are based on the world as it exists today. And so we basically presume all of the increase or strength of the U.S. dollar that you\u2019re seeing today but not that it continues to get worse. On provision, we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying. We see a continued pathway to have loan growth grow at a good cliff. Obviously, provision will grow with it. And as we continue to get the cumulative impact of a lot of really good growth in loans then you have a different mix more early tenure folks. And so there is a little bit of seasoning that will also drive these provision rates up a bit. So that\u2019s all built into the commentary we made today.\nToby Willard: Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining the call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.\nOperator: Thank you.

The discussions today contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s earnings press release and earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the Company\u2019s other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon everyone. Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our 2015 financial outlook and reflected the headwinds that we\u2019ve been managing throughout 2015 during a challenging, economic, competitive and regulatory environment. Consistent with the expectations that we discussed publicly in mid-September, reported Q3 EPS of $1.24 was down 11% versus the prior year. And on an FX suggested basis, we did see a modest slowing sequentially in the billings growth rate from 6% to 5% and saw adjusted revenue growth slow from 5% in Q2 to 3% in Q3. As in the first two quarters of 2015, our third quarter results continued to reflect the discreet impacts from various changes to certain of our co-brand partnerships and a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year both of which I\u2019ll quantify later in my remarks. The decline in earnings versus the prior year was also in part driven by increased spending on growth initiatives. I\u2019d remind you that as we considered earlier this year the implications of the pending termination in 2016 of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. we made the decision to increase spending in 2015 across a range of business opportunities to best position the company for long term growth. While our reported results reflect the discrete impacts our performance continued to reflect healthy loan growth, strong card member and merchant acquisitions, write off rates at historically low levels, disciplined operating expense control and the benefits of our strong capital position. Through all of this, we continued to drive an ROE above our on average and overtime target of 25% demonstrating the continued strength of our business model. As we turn to the slides, we are once again beginning our presentation with the financial outlook framework that we first shared at Investor Day in March. As we believe it remains a useful framework for discussing the drivers of our current performance. I\u2019ll provide more details on the specific drivers as we review our reported results, but overall we believe we are doing the right things to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term. Thinking ahead to Q4, we expect results to reflect some of the same headwinds as the current quarter including incremental spending on growth initiatives as well as the discreet impacts from changes in our co-brand relationships and a stronger U.S. dollar. I\u2019d also remind you that in Q4 2014 we had a net benefit related to the sale of our investment in Concur. Throughout this year we have said that our full year 2015 outlook was for EPS to be flat to modestly down versus the prior year. To be more specific as we sit here today with one quarter left in the year, we estimate that full year 2015 EPS will be between $5.20 and $5.35. We believe our outlook to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and within our target range of 12% to 15% in 2017 remains appropriate. As you recall, our outlook for 2015 to 2017 does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies. Now to turn to a review of our financial results on Slide 3. Billings were flat versus the prior year on a reported basis. Adjusted for FX, billings growth was 5% during Q3 reflecting slower volume growth across our U.S. consumer and corporate portfolios. I\u2019ll provide more details on our build business performance shortly. Reported revenues were down 1% but were up 3% after adjusting for FX. This is slower than the adjusted Q2 revenue growth rate in part due to the modestly slower billings growth and the merchant rebate accrual benefit that impacted discount revenue last quarter. Net income was down 14% year-over-year primarily reflecting an increase in spending on growth initiatives and the discreet impacts from changes to our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. We estimate that the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% during the quarter and that the negative impact from FX further reduced EPS by another approximately 4% to 5%. Below the net income line we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders and have repurchased 56 million shares over the past 12 months, which has reduced our average share count by 5%. As a result, EPS was down 11% versus the prior year despite the 14% drop in net income and at $0.02 EPS impact related to our preferred dividend payment. As we have said previously, we expected our quarterly earnings performanace will be more uneven during this transitional period and certainly you saw that in our results this quarter. Our focus continues to be on the earnings outlook for each year and the long term as opposed to the performance any given quarter. Turning to our billings performance by region on slide four, on an FX suggested basis billings growth was 5% during the quarter versus 6% in Q2 driven by a sequential decline in U.S. volume growth. I\u2019ll provide more context on the U.S. results in a few minutes so let me begin with a review of the international billings trends. While we continue to face an evolving regulatory landscape going forward, we have seen very solid performance trends across our international regions over the last several quarters. JAPA remained our fastest growth region with volumes up 14% on an FX suggested basis. The strong performance was again powered by Japan and China. While performance in China remained robust year-over-year growth was lower than in Q2 which drove a deceleration in regional volume growth and also in the GNS segment as you will see on the next slide. As a reminder, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it is a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today. Moving to the EMEA region, volume growth remained consistent at 9% on an FX suggested basis including double digit growth in the U.K. The year-over-year decline in LACC volumes is being driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This will continue to impact our volume growth until Q1 2016, although it will begin to lessen next quarter as Costco began accepting other network products in its Canadian warehouses during Q4, 2014. Outside of Canada, LACC regional growth remains in the double digits including strong performance in Mexico and Argentina during Q3. Overall, international performance excluding Canada continued to be strong with volumes up 11% on an FX suggested basis versus the prior year during Q3. We are pleased with our progress outside the U.S. which reflects strong performance in the consumer and network businesses where we have seen encouraging returns on our recent growth initiatives. As our largest global issuer, we constantly balance global strategies and local execution seeking to leverage our best practices, capabilities and learnings in all the markets in which we compete. Looking at the results by segment now on slide five, we saw a slower growth in GCS or billings were up 1% on an FX suggested basis and in the USCS segment where volume growth slowed to 5% versus 6% last quarter. As I mentioned in my initial comments, billings growth particularly in the U.S. continues to be impacted by a number of headwinds during 2015. I\u2019ll provide a bit of color on this. On average we are seeing lower average transaction sizes in the U.S. as opposed to card members using their American Express cards less frequently. In total, U.S. transactions increased 7% versus the prior year with the average transaction size was down 3%. We are clearly seeing this impact on gas spending, where for the industry average gas prices are down 25% versus the prior year. Lower average transaction sizes are also a driver within airline spending which constitutes 7% of our total volumes in the U.S. and is down 3% year-over-year. And this decrease is consistent with the recent trends in average ticket prices and revenue performance across the U.S. airline industry. The slower airline spend had a larger relative impact within GCS, where airlines make up approximately 25% total spend. Also in GCS we saw a slowdown in growth across middle market customers in the U.S. Despite this near term performance we do see opportunities to accelerate growth in this segment as we continue to focus and leverage our efforts to bring together some of the unique products and services we can offer to middle market customers. And last, moving back to the USCS segment consistent with the prior quarter we saw volumes on the Costco co-brand product soften [ph]. Although the loan portfolio and Costco remained approximately 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of Q3. More broadly on Costco we have not seen a significant earnings impact from Costco in the U.S. as lower volume growth to date has been offset by reduced marketing expenses associated with the co-brand portfolio. One other Costco point, we do realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. Reality is this is a very complex transaction and I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to comment on the specifics during the discussions. We will provide more detail on the outcome and its implications for our 2016 EPS outlook as soon as the discussions are complete. Moving on now to loan growth on slide six, you can see that worldwide loans increased by 4% versus last year. In the U.S. which constitutes the majority of our loans, growth was steady at 7% during Q3 and continues to outpace the industry. International loan balances remain down year-over-year due to FX and the end of our Costco relationship in Canada. Excluding the negative impact of FX and Canadian loan balances, however international loan growth improved to 9% during Q3. So we are pleased with the underlying trends of loan growth. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing and new customers globally without significantly changing the overall list profile. Now like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened significantly year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. as you can see at the bottom slide seven. The dollar\u2019s strength will have an impact on our performance for the balance of the year and could impact 2016 as well. Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX suggested revenue growth rates you can see the difference between our reported revenue growth and our FX suggested revenue growth remained relatively consistent as FX dragged our reported revenue growth by approximately 400 basis points in both Q2 and Q3. When reached [ph] moved this dramatically there is also a bottom line impact. And as I mentioned earlier, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar reduced our EPS by approximately 4% to 5% during the quarter. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company it generates revenue when a diverse set of markets around the world is strength of our business model. So, let's move now to our revenue performance on slide eight. Where you see that our reported revenues were down 1% versus the prior year, but increase 3% on an FX adjusted basis. As I just discussed the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on a number of revenue lines including discount revenue, net card fees and other commissions, which all increased year-over-year after adjusting for FX. Other revenue also grew versus Q3, 2014 after adjusting for FX and the gain from the sales of ICBC and Concur shares in the prior year. FX adjusted revenue growth of 3% did slow sequentially versus the prior quarter, this was in part due to the modest slowing and billed business growth that I discussed. I'd also remind you, that our second quarter results included a benefit in discount revenue related to certain merchant rebate accruals, which resulted in a year-over-year increase at a discount rate during Q2. The two basis points year-over-year decline in the discount rate this quarter was in part driving by the growth of the OptBlue program, as well as the continued downward pressure that we traditionally have from changes in mix competition. These impacts were partially offset by the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we're under much lower than average discount rate. We continue to make steady progress with the OptBlue program. With the recent edition of Chase Paymentech all of the top ten U.S. merchant acquirers have now signed up to join the OptBlue program. We are signing a significant number of new merchants to the program and are focused on driving greater awareness and card member spending at these new AmEx-accepting locations over time. Continuing, the merchant related items in the U.S. it's now been approximately three months since the DoJ's remedy took effect. While the remedy has not yet had an impact on our business, it is still too early to tell what the longer term impact in the marketplace will be? Before moving on slide eight, I would say, we are pleased with the strong growth of 8% in net interest income driven by our continued progress and growing the loan portfolio and lower funding costs. Turning to credit, on slide nine, we are pleased that our lending credit metrics remained at low levels with our write-off rate declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rates remaining flat. Moving to slide 10, our credit performance during the quarter combined with higher loan balances to drive an 8% year-over-year increase in provision, which included a $53 million reserve billed. Our credit metrics have been steadily improving since the downturn. They have generally stabilized at the current levels over the course of the past year. Therefore reserve releases from improved credit performance are no longer offsetting the additional reserves needed to higher loan balances. This performance is in line with our expectations that provision would increase year-over-year and in part reflect the steady growth we are seeing in the loan portfolio. Going forward, we do continue to anticipate that write-off rates will gradually increase from today's low levels in part due to the seasoning of our newer loan vintages. This is consistent with our comments from investor day about expecting to see some steady upward tick write-off rates and the modest billed in reserves over the outlook period. Moving to expense performance on slide 11, our total expenses increased by 3% during the current quarter, performance deferred significantly across P&L lines. And all expenses benefited from the year-over-year change in FX rates. On an FX adjusted basis, total expenses increased by 7% during the quarter. I'll walk you through the details of marketing and promotion and operating expenses in a few minutes. Let me first touch on a few other items on this slide. Reward expense increased 4% versus the prior year, a bit above the growth proprietary billings, which excludes GNS. Performance this quarter includes the portion of discreet impact from renewed co-brand relationships. Our renewed co-brand relationships continue to have a more significant impact on the cost [Indiscernible] is up 31% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we estimate that all of the changes in our co-brand relationships reduced EPS by approximately 5% this quarter. This estimate includes the impact of our renewed co-brand relationships with Delta, Starwood, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and Iberia, as well as the net impact on our Canadian business from the end of our Costco relationship. The co-brand impact is primarily concentrated in cost of card member services and reward expenses, although there is an impact on revenue growth as well. Let's now turn to the marketing and promotion, slide 12. Marketing and promotion expenses were $847 million in the quarter and were up significantly from Q2 due to the higher spending on growth initiatives we did this quarter. On year-over-year basis marketing and promotion was 8% higher than the prior year, it was up 14% after adjusting for FX. The increase in M&P this quarter is consistent with our expectations as we have been clear since the Costco decision earlier this year that we intent for the spending on growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be at or slightly higher than the elevated levels of full year 2014. We have also highlighted that the increase will be more concentrated in the third and fourth quarters. To provide some additional perspective about our growth initiative spending, we included the breakdown on slide 13 that we have previous shared in mid September. We continue to feel that this slide is helpful way to think about what we broadly consider to be our spending on growth initiatives within the company. As you can see, while a large portion of this spending occurs within marketing and promotion. A significant amount also occurs within operating expenses. Some of the impact also shows up as contra revenue. I can make a few comments related specifically to the spending during the third quarter. A large portion of the increase in marketing and promotion during Q3 was focused on our efforts to attract new card members across our consumer small business, corporate franchises around the globe. For example, in our U.S. consumer business we ramped up acquisition efforts, our cash rebate products as well as our gold charge card, Starwood preferred guest credit card both of which were recently refresh with several new card member benefits. We also increased our spending on longer term technology initiatives including efforts to enhance the digital capabilities that we provide to middle market corporations and small businesses. A higher spending during Q3 also help drive progress across the number of business initiatives including adding Sam's to our merchant-acceptance network, rolling out Apple Pay to our corporate card and U.K. card members as well as the continued expansion of the Plenti loyalty coalition program. So as I just mentioned the efforts to attract new card members are one of the key focus areas for our incremental growth initiative spending. In this context we are pleased to see that these efforts drove a significant increase in new card acquired across our U.S. consumer, small business and corporate issuing businesses during the current quarter as you can see on slide 14. Now obviously it will take time from the benefits from these new acquisitions to impact our results, which is why our focus has consistently been on our performance over the multiyear outlook period. Moving to operating expenses on slide 15, operating expenses were down 1% year-over-year and increase 3% on an FX adjusted basis. As I mentioned, operating expense performance this quarter reflected an increase level of spending on growth initiatives including a number of technology initiatives. As a portion of the spending on these technology initiative hits the professional services and occupancy and equipment line, we'll provide a bit more detail on just what is including [Indiscernible]. Starting with professional services, I would point out that the majority of expenses in this line are related to the technology cost that we pay third parties. This P&L line also includes the fees we pay third parties for credit and collection activities, as well as some of the incentives we pay merchant acquirers. Similarly, moving to occupancy and equipment, over 75% of the cost in this line on a year to-date basis are related to data processing including the license fees, we pay technology providers and depreciation costs associated with our technology hardware and software. The remainder consist primarily depreciation expense on office equipment and buildings and the rents we pay for office space around the world. Similar to our performance across other operating expense lines, we have gained efficiency in our professional services and occupancy and equipment expenses over time. As we have rationalized our technology infrastructure and location footprint around the world, we believe there is a sustained opportunity to deliver operating leverage going forward as technology continues to become cheaper and more powerfully each year and our customers and merchants increasingly demonstrate a preference to engage with us through more digital channels. Moving on, let me touch specifically, 21% increase in occupancy and equipment expense this quarter. The increase was driven by a $91 million impairment charge related to previously capitalized software development cost primarily within enterprise curve including the decision not to continue with certain investments within the group. We continuously evaluate our investments across the company to ensure that we are deploying the right level of resources against our most attractive opportunities. In this context, we decided to pull back on certain initiatives in enterprise globe during the current quarter including the decision to not proceed with the launch of served product, Mexico. These decisions are aligned with some recent organizational changes with enterprise growth including consolidating the server platform and related capabilities under Steve Squeri. More broadly, we continually look at ways to make our overall organization more effective, streamlining the processes that cut across multiple parts of the company, and focusing the organization on a most attractive growth opportunities in both the consumer and business to business space. As we set priorities for 2016 and beyond, we will focus on those opportunities that can produce the best returns. And we will be ensuring that we have the proper operating structure to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way. To conclude now on operating expenses and moving to slide 16, despite the greater spending on technology initiatives in the quarter adjusted operating expenses are down 3% on a year to-date basis and up 1% on an FX adjusted basis both well below our 3% target for 2015. Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 17, during the quarter we've return well over 100% of the capital generated to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. Our Q3 performance again demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength and also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. So let me now conclude, by stepping away some of the complex that I just took it through and going back the key themes is in our results. Overall our Q3 performance reflected the headwinds and challenges that we have been managing throughout 2015. As expected or into a down year-over-year due to the ramp up and spending on growth initiatives and the discreet impacts, some changes in our co-brand relationships and the stronger U.S. dollar. In addition, billings and revenue growth continue to be impacted by the challenging economic competitive in regulatory environment. Against this backdrop we continue to move ahead with initiatives to build our business the years ahead. We're investing substantially more at marketing incentives and technology to attract new card members and additional spending to our network. We're expanding card acceptance at an accelerated pace amongst merchants and added Sam's Club, the eighth largest retailer in the U.S. throughout network earlier this month. We're broadening our relationship with card members to accommodate more of their borrowing needs and our loan portfolio continues steady growth this quarter. The flexibility to investment in these another growth initiative comes in part of our ongoing progress in containing operating expenses throughout the company. We also continue to benefit from a strong balance sheet that allow us to return a substantially portion of our earnings to shareholders to share repurchases, dividends. We remained committed to these actions and believe that these are the right things to do to achieve our multiyear outlook and position the company for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session, therefore before we open up the lines for Q&A I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process. With that, the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Hi, thanks. Two questions, first could talk about the magnitude to which cash back rewards acting as a country revenue items are impacting the merchant discount rate. And secondly, you're calling out loyalty partner in your press release as adding to revenue growth in a meaningful way. Can you contrast that to Plenti and how we should think growth in Plenti long term? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Let me start, Craig with the cash back question, certainly in the U.S. consumer business in particular we have been seeing very nice growth in our cash back products and as you know the accounting for our cash back products does push \u2013 does make the cash back a contra revenue. So when you look at the discount rate that we report what we try to do is reflect the actual economics that we're getting at the point of sell with the merchants and so we try to \u2013 we take that out of that calculation. What you do the straight calculation of the income statement of discount revenue over your business; you are capturing the higher growth rates of the cash back products. All that said, I would say that in the grant scheme of the company overall the cash back product still relatively modest part of the overall portfolio which is why we don't specifically call out the impact it has on [Indiscernible]. In terms of royalty partner what I would say is to remind everyone we have a business that is more mature in a variety of other countries around the globe like Germany, Poland, India, it\u2019s a little bit newer in Mexico and in Italy and we're really pleased with the way the business is developed in all of those countries as it has gotten to profitability. When you go to the U.S. we were really pleased and excited about the launch of Plenti earlier this year. It\u2019s very, very early days in the U.S. and so we're very encouraged by the growth that we've seen and the number of members that Plenti has been able to attract that you head several of the other partners in Plenti talk about their view of the progress and it\u2019s all very positive. What I would say on the U.S is it\u2019s still early days and we will need to see how it progresses over the next year or two before begins to have a more material impact on the company's financial results.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Don Vendetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Vendetti: Hi, Jeff. Just wanted to ask on your GNS business and I guess also on U.S. in general. Do you think you're holding your market share in GNS, you clearly laid out some issues around the pressure from airline pricing and maybe China was off a little bit? But if you strip that out, that's always been kind of like a very strong area for you, can you talk a little bit about that. And then on the U.S. side, I should say more on the corporate side, do you think you have a structural issue there or you just kind of weak because of general economics and some of the issues you highlight last quarter around airlines?\nJeff Campbell: So couple of the questions there Don, I maybe parse it into pieces talking a little bit about GNS, little bit about the U.S on share and then maybe little bit about corporate solely each of those. If you look GNS, just to remind everyone, our GNS business generate some about 85% or so of its billings outside the U.S and then about 15% comp in the U.S. so you really have a broad range of market conditions. You have markets like the U.S., Australia, U.K., where we run a network business side by side with our proprietary business. And then you have a lot of markets around the globe, China being a good example where through our partner and in fact the GNS business that's how we operator American Express through a franchise model. So across that many different markets, I think it\u2019s a little challenging to generalize by share, but I would make the general points that we're really pleased with the growth rate we're seeing in GNS everywhere in the world. And share is something that we probably think about differentially in each market depending on whether it\u2019s a pure GNS market or a combined proprietary and GNS market. But I would say, we feel very good about our share trends on a combined basis outside the U.S. and when you take out the one challenge we have in Canada, I think we \u2013 when you look at our overall international growth rates, we'll match up very well in most few quarters with the broader sense. And turning to the U.S. you talked about U.S share, we probably have loss a little bit of share to U.S. in recent quarters, but I'll make a broader point that over the last five years of actual gain quite a bit of share in the U.S and we think about our prospects over the longer term. We also are focused at the end of the day on our share industry profits and industry revenues. We actually think we've done pretty well including in recent quarters on that front. We're very thoughtful about what opportunities are going to produce the best return to our shareholders and sometime that does not always leave you to the same answer as what might produce largest billings share. Go to last part of your question, go to corporate in particular in the U.S. as I said in my remarks, the slowdown in airlines spend and all the airlines see what is remarkable when you look both the large profits, you are also generating right now even the drop in fuel prices, but also the pretty tough revenue environment therein with industry revenues and industry unit revenues and the U.S. down. That just reflected in our numbers where we don't think we're losing it share. When we look at numbers of transactions but the average transaction size is just trending right along with the airline. Industry spends, that does particularly impact our corporate business since airlines were about 25% of that business. And we have seen a little bit of slowdown in the middle market part of our corporate business. As I mentioned in my remarks, but I would tell you over the medium to long term we continue to see this area of the middle market section of business and the U.S. is a real growth opportunity for us that's why we made some of the organizational changes we made earlier this year putting together our corporate card business and our open franchise under the leadership of Steve Squeri because that's why I talked a little bit about some of the technology initiatives. Spending, we are doing to strengthen and refine some of our products targeted at that segment. So, we haven't lost any of our enthusiasm for growth opportunities in that segment in the medium to long term, if you have seen a number of factors that slowed us down this quarter.\nDon Vendetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Good afternoon. You added lot of new cards this quarter substantial increase more than what we expected now. What is the cost regarding those cards, does cost per account gone up and if not, why not accelerate marketing, obviously that would be the best way to grow through the Costco in 2017 is to continue to add substantial number of account, so maybe just talk about the quality of the accounts, the cost per account and whether or not the amount of cards we saw this quarter is sustainable? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Good question, Bob. We feel really good and really pleased to see the growth in new accounts. What I would point out is we see growth opportunities across lots of the pieces of our portfolio and the reason you've heard us talk about since earlier this year staying at an elevated level growth oriented spending in 2015 is because we wanted to do exactly what you just suggested, which is as we think about the termination of the Costco U.S. contracts sometime in 2016, we think we have a lot of growth opportunities. We think in a significant fixed cost business, it makes a lot of sense to sees as many of the growth opportunities as we tend now to position ourselves for that Costco change in 2016. When you think about what we're requiring, we feel really good about the average quality of the accounts we're acquiring. And in terms of cost of acquiring those accounts and we look at historical trends we also feel really good that we are spending more absolute dollars that's with the elevated level of growth spending is all about and its being reflected in a much higher level of new account cards acquired in the average cost is pretty similar to what we've historically experience. So I suppose the other part of your question, why don't you do even more? Well, we're always balancing our financial material and marketing resources and trying to make trade-offs that we think are optimal for our shareholders. So we are \u2013 we believe we're going as aggressively as we can and should be given the range of opportunities. And I would just say we're encouraged by the progress we saw this last quarter.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And next question from the line of Bill Carache of Nomura. Please go ahead.\nBill Carache: Thank you. Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Bill.\nBill Carache: I wanted to ask a question I've gotten from several investors who are wondering whether the quarter's results suggest that you guys are facing a little bit more pressure than you expected earlier in the year. I know you said that the results were in line with your expectations. But I think the reason people are asking is because the 2015 target EPS growth range of 520 to 535 that you provided implies in the area of I think like 3.5 to kind of 6.5, negative 6.5% growth and I think people are viewing that as worse than the flat to slightly negative growth range that you've given previously and so I was hoping that maybe you could speak to that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, it\u2019s good question, Bill. I think as we look at 2015 on the earnings side the reality is it will come in very much in the range that we originally envisioned. If you go back to February when we first provided an outlook and I suppose it goes little bit to how you want to define modestly down. The reason we gave a range if you go back to the beginning of 2015 is we wanted to make sure in the current environment we're giving ourselves the flexibility to do the right things for the company for the long-term. If you think about the question that Bob just asked, we are pleased by what we saw in the outcome or some of the fruits of the higher levels of spending we did in Q3 and that does suggest to us that we should continue to pursue many of those growth opportunities and stay at a pretty elevated level of spending to do it and that does drive us probably more towards the modestly down part of our original guidance than the flat part of our guidance. I do want to downplay the fact that as you've seen in the last couple of years, it\u2019s also a tough economic environment. If you go back to January and February as we were putting our plans in place and you look at all the economic forecasts and we just raise our own plans on the consensus economic forecast, we don't try to say we could forecast better than anybody else. The actual have all come in below what the consensus was earlier this year and we are used to that, part of the flexibility in our business model as we've got a lot leverage to pull, to make sure we can react to that. But that has been a challenging thing for us. Gas prices staying down, it\u2019s been challenging. Foreign exchange getting a little worse. When we first provided an outlook for 2015 the US dollar on a weighted average basis versus the range of currencies that matter to us was probably down around 10%. It\u2019s gone down close to another 10% since then. So all those things are factors, but we're trying to focus on our the core underlying things that will really determine the run rate of the company as we get past a range of the challenges facing us in the near term here and we feel pretty good about those trends.\nBill Carache: I appreciate that. Thank you for taking my question, Jeff.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And the next question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Maybe to follow-up on that last question. I guess then as we look forward and you guys talk about returning to growth, how do you define returning to growth and what gives you the confidence that you can achieve this and I guess how does the Costco portfolio sale affect, I know you cannot really speak to Costco's portfolio sale. But how does that sale factor into the return to growth? And just one final one, how much of the run rate of cost savings from the workforce reduction is actually in this year's number? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Finishing right note Sanjay, that\u2019s a lot of questions. I want to make sure I get them\u2026\nSanjay Sakhrani: Sorry.\nJeff Campbell: No, all really good questions. So how do we define growth? I guess what I will tell you is that our view of sort of absolute levels of what we believe we can achieve in 2016 has not changed at all, since February. So nothing that we have seen that I just talked about in response to bills question are things that we don't think are manageable within all of the leverage we have to pull thinking about 2016. Second, when you think about Costco I'll remind you that when we first back on February 12 provided our two year financial outlook, we said we're confident that we can achieve the 2016 outlook we've then provided which was a return to positive growth, sort of regardless of what happened with Costco portfolio. So we still don't know what the outcome is going to be around the portfolio. When we do, we will talk about it publicly quickly. And when we do that will allow us Sanjay to be more precise because there's a lot of \u2013 there is quite a range of outcomes around the portfolio and until we know those it\u2019s tough to give you a number. But what I want to come back to is the point I'm trying to make is that the underlying performance - to a positive earnings performance in 2015, so we lost are lights here in. If you think about what the drivers our next year, well, just think about our financial framework, so the co-brand headwinds that we've had all of 2015, 5% was the headwind this quarter drop away as you get into 2016. FX for particularly this quarter is a big headwind. Now, I suppose the dollar could move another 10% or 20% over the course of the next four quarters and if it does that will be headwind for us. But if it doesn\u2019t, you should have an easier compare next year from an FX perspective. You brought up costs, you are correct that in fact when you look at some of the actions that are behind the restructuring charge we took at the end of 2014 many of those savings won't really get to full year run rate until you get to 2016. I'd also remind you that we said all along that we will be mindful as we think about volume trends and Costco going away about what further steps we can take to make other improvements in our cost structure. So all of those things Sanjay to conclude combined to say my view of what this company can generate in 2016 is really the same today as it was in February when we first provided the guidance In my view of 2015 is we really have come in within the envelope that we set for ourselves, leaving ourselves enough flexibility to make the right decisions to run the company for the long-term.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. Next question is from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick clarification. It looks like you restated book value historically can you just tell us happen there?\nJeff Campbell: Restated. You might need to help me out, Rich. I am not sure\u2026\nRick Shane: When we look back the book value didn\u2019t tie out to what we had previously and when we went back and looked at the old numbers there was a difference, is there anything there or are we just screwing something up?\nJeff Campbell: This maybe one we need to take off-line. I'm looking around at my colleagues here and we're not quite sure, but let's get to the\u2026\nRick Shane: Okay. I'll hope with you off-line. Thank you, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: All right. Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And next question from the line of David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hochstim: Thanks. Hi, Jeff. I'm wondering could you expand on your comments about enterprise growth and the changes you made. And I guess I really want to understand also with the $91 million impairment charge is sort of a one-time item or is that kind of recurring, because it\u2019s really equal to the FX headwind and the co-brand headwind if it\u2019s not recurring?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so a couple of comments. We are continually looking at all of the choices we have about where we invest our management and financial resources in order to produce the best outcome for our shareholders. And we continually learn from things we try, we continually need to react to the evolving competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate. And so one of the things that we've done over the last quarter is made some different decisions about product strategies and resource allocation around a number of the businesses [Indiscernible] As you do that's from a pure accounting perspective, the reality in a company like ours where you are developing a lot of software and where you capitalize a fair amount of the software as you sometimes end up with things on the balance sheet that relate to products that you are deemphasizing or not going to continue with. One of the examples I did callout in my remarks is we had planned to launch the Siro [ph] product in Mexico. That may still be a good idea at some point, but we decided looking around at all of our other opportunities that\u2019s not something we want to further invest in right now and that does drive pulling some assets off the balance sheet. So all of that lead you to, this is certainly not a recurring event; this is a one-time sort of charge that is reflective of decisions that were made this quarter. I would just make the observation that I tried to be pretty clear in my remarks that in the current challenging competitive regulatory and economic environment you will see us continually making changes to the organization. And to where we choose to put resources and that may from time-to-time drive other kinds of one-time charges or contingencies that won't stop us from doing things we think are the best interest of long-term value creation for shareholders.\nDavid Hochstim: Okay. But I mean, wouldn\u2019t you've been consider this a kind of one time item like FX this quarter?\nJeff Campbell: I suppose it depends, David on exactly how you want to define one-time item. I'm just trying to be clear on what the $91 million was.\nDavid Hochstim: All right. Okay. Sorry and I know only one question like everybody else. The Costco being, is that included in your 2016 guidance?\nJeff Campbell: No, I think we've always said going back to when we first provided the outlook on February 12, that our comment that we will return to positive EPS growth in 2016 was really agnostic on the question of what happens with Costco and did not include any particular net gain on the Costco sale.\nDavid Hochstim: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And the next question from the line of Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Brendler, your line is open.\nChris Brendler: Sorry I was on mute, can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes.\nJeff Campbell: Now it\u2019s clear.\nChris Brendler: Hi, actually my question. Good afternoon. So I wanted to ask a follow up question on the U.S. business. You\u2019ve heard some of your competitors complaining about the competitive environment in the U.S. and just how aggressive the rewards competition has become. And I really haven\u2019t heard American Express address that as an issue that\u2019s weighting on growth. So maybe if you could just help me think about what\u2019s happening in the U.S. business, has it decelerated but these are mostly just a co-brand that you\u2019ve potentially lost or is there also increased competition there?\nJeff Campbell: Well Chris, I try never to complain. I try to focus on what we can do better, and there\u2019s always plenty of things we can do better on. Look, it\u2019s a challenging competitive environment. And we would not dispute that in anyway and I think I started my earlier comments by saying it\u2019s a pretty challenging environment. All that said, our goal at American Express is to take the many fairly unique strengths that we have and find ways to create great offerings for our card members and our merchants in ways that are not necessarily easily replicable. The strength of our brand is something I think nobody else can really match. The breadth of our product line which allows us to offer very targeted value propositions because everybody who is listening to this call will have a different range of things that they value most and we think the breadth of our product line merely allows us to hone in on the many different demographic groups targets that we have who we think we can provide value for. Our reputation for service, our global reach, the size and scale of our proprietary rewards program membership rewards. Some of the data and analytics we get from the close loop and the way that allows us to be very targeted in our marketing and they are already targeted and how we work with our merchants and how we put together offers. Those are all the kinds of things that we try very hard to leverage, so that as we think about what is undoubtedly a very competitive environment. We\u2019re not just out there saying, boy can we offer 10 basis points more on a cash net card then everybody else cause that\u2019s going to be the whole determinant. You\u2019ve heard me say on these calls before there will always be some portion card members who actually do want to go to website, pop the map and say what card is going to produce the best math for me. And we are going to have a tougher time using our -- some of our differentiated strengths for that segment. And our experience that is still on minority customers. And we think the breadth of our product line and many strengths we have allow us to compete in ways that produce better outcomes for our shareholders.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Next question from the line of David Ho of Deutsche Bank\nDavid Ho: Hi, good evening. I just want to circle back on the Costco medication, obviously it\u2019s kind of a broad based approach we are taking, but we are seeing evidence that you know that you are targeting Costco customers and trying to maybe transition some of the value onto your existing ongoing cards like the Blue crash [ph] everyday. Is that something that makes sense in terms of transitioning from the value onto your core products or some of your more attractive Costco customers ahead of the sale?\nJeff Campbell: Well David, I\u2019ll make a few points. We are seeing many opportunities to grow our business and to grow our card member base across all of our consumer business portfolios around the globe. One of the reasons we concluded earlier this year that in the long run we had better opportunities than going forward with what we think it would have taken to maintain our relationship with Costco. We based it on the view that we have many growth opportunities and that\u2019s what we are pursuing. And we\u2019ll be pleased that if you just look at the new cards acquired numbers this quarter comes from every part of our company. Now certainly one of the avenues for growth is there is some portion of Costco card members who have strong ties through American Express and we\u2019d love to work with capturing the spend and lend of those people, subject to as I\u2019ve also said many times the normal provisions you would expect in most of these kinds of contracts that put a lot of limitations around how you specifically market to the Costco card members. So we are very diligent about making sure we adhere to the spirit and letter of that contract. So our marketing efforts are really about how do we just in general market to all the many routes across the U.S. and across the globe that we think are attractive candidates to be card members of American Express and certainly as we do that some portion of the Costco card members are liable to see those efforts and likely to be interested in pursuing a relationship with American Express in another way.\nDavid Ho: Okay. Thanks and on a related note, can you please remind us how quickly when you find out the new card customer it really depends on the mix, but how quickly you typically see a tick up in revolving activity after some of these new card acquisitions, is it you know a few quarters, is it one year out and how you think about that?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, I want to be a little careful about being specific because when you have the breadth of products we do from consumer to business to corporations to lend products to charge card products the answer is a little different for every one of those types of products as a really general matter to look. As I said in my remarks, while we are really pleased that we acquired 2.3 million new card members this quarter, there is a process of getting them to understand the product. They are beginning to build spend, beginning to build a little bit of royalty to American Express. For those who are going to engage in lend or borrowing behavior that balance that has to build. As a general matter, we think of getting to the point where you are having meaningful bottom line contribution from new card that requires being something that happens in the second and third year. You\u2019ll see other metrics show up much more quickly but at the end of the day we are very focused on what it takes to get people to profitability.\nDavid Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cheryl Pate of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCheryl Pate: Hi, good afternoon. I just want to touch back on the comments earlier about the average transaction size coming down a little bit and appreciate the color around gas and airlines. I was just wondering if there is anything else we should be thinking about there as well. For example, in some of the new card acquisitions is that meaningfully different customer than your current average customer or does something like OptBlue where we are adding a lot of small merchants, does that factor in as well?\nJeff Campbell: Those are all actually really good questions Cheryl, would probably answer [Indiscernible] as precise as any of us would like. Now I\u2019d make a couple of points. The -- our transaction growth has been to make a general statement -- that really consistent over the last couple of years in around that 7% level. What is quite striking in recent quarters is the way the average transaction size is really the trend lines has really changed. Certainly some of the things we do about our steady efforts to drive more everyday spend you would expect over a long period of time and a gradual rate have an impact here. But what you really see is quite different. And as a little bit more tied in timing to cash prices going down to some of the challenges the airlines have had on the revenue side. And in fact we see the average transaction size coming down across other categories like retail as well. So, I have to tell you at this point we\u2019re still spending a lot of time thinking ourselves about just what it all means. I think there is probably a little bit of influence from some of the things we are doing internally, but I think there is a lot of influence from a variety of external factors in just what\u2019s going on in the overall very low inflation to so many categories frankly, maybe there is inflation and economy that we are now doing business in.\nCheryl Pate: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. The next question from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, hi, I have --an actually related question that if we look back over the past three quarters, U.S. card member loan growth has actually outpaced U.S. card service build business growth by 1% to 2%. Historically we\u2019ve seen kind of the [Indiscernible] build business growth really kind of wed your loan growth going forward. Is that a sign Jeff that you are kind of shifting on incremental growth towards more of a -- kind of a lend centric customer base than a spend centric and if so kind of what are the implications for the migration of returns?\nJeff Campbell: That\u2019s a good question, Mark. I think you have to keep this in perspective. So if you look overall at American Express, net interest income is -- and how you want to measure it 15% to 20% of our P&L that unlike any of our competitors where the numbers are 50% to 90%. We have a very spend centric collection of businesses. When the Costco loan portfolio goes away in 2016, that\u2019s 20% of the loan portfolio that drives that net interest income. So we have in our view a long lease to go over the next few years just to stay in place in terms of the current contribution that lend makes to the overall economics of the company. And that\u2019s why we do in the U.S. consumer business, let\u2019s call it some of our other businesses, see a little bit of opportunity to continue on the path we\u2019ve been on for a few years which is when you look at our own customers we under index on our share getting our share of their borrowing behavior versus the share of their spend behavior, that to us is just an opportunity to obvious for us not to continually work at it. And that\u2019s really what has allowed us for many quarters now to steadily grow our loan balances above where the industry was going then in the U.S. or you\u2019ll hear us over and over again say but we\u2019re comfortable that we are doing that without materially changing the risk profile of the company. So that\u2019s really all you see going on here and as I said I think we will be quite some time once the Costco loan portfolio goes away before we even back to where we are today. But the exciting thing to us we see a long ramp, that should allow us to continue to grow loans in the U.S. a little bit faster than the industry while I\u2019m changing the risk profile of the company.\nMark DeVries: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Rochelle, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And then the final question then comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. With interchange caps going into effect this December in Europe, what actions will American Express take to sustain your growth, even though your proprietary business will not be regulated. Your merchant discount rate to be twice as high as MasterCards which potentially could negatively pressure merchant acceptance?\nJeff Campbell: Good question, David. We said for a while that when you look at the EU regulation which to remind everyone is that it targeted the semester card and will cap interchange rates. That will put some downward pressure on our discount rates. And frankly you see that downward pressure even this year. Despite that, I\u2019ll be pretty pleased with our performance in Europe this year and I would point out to you that we have long had in Europe in most countries varies by country, but in most country very significant premium to MasterCard and Visa. So that\u2019s not a new phenomenon. What the Interchange regulation will do is put downward pressure on us, not to go to the points where the Interchange is capped, but put pressure on us to move it down probably to keep the differential more similar. So I think we\u2019ll have to see how this goes. I would tell you that sitting here today we are pretty pleased by this year\u2019s result and you already see changes in the competitive environment as the number of issuers have announced pullbacks on the products or rewards they are able to offer. And like all of these things our challenge and opportunity is to try to find ways to mitigate the obvious downside which will put some downward pressure on our discoveries in Europe, but trying to offset that with saying the word opportunities because they create to perhaps do somethings that other can\u2019t and at the end of the day I think what the European regulations are really seeking is a competitive and more competitive European environment. Our market shares in most of those countries are quite small, so we loved being more competitive to find ways to grow overtime, but both we\u2019ll have to see.\nDavid Togut: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: So let me thank you all for joining tonight\u2019s call and Toby do you want to make a few last comments?\nToby Willard: Sure, thanks Jeff. As part of our commitment to provide investors with the exposure of company leadership our executives plan to speak at several events in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the next few months, American Express Vice Chairman, Steve Squeri plans to present in the Citi Financial Technology conference in New York City on November 10th. Additionally, Jeff Campbell plans to participate in the JPMorgan Financial Technologies and Specialty finance forum in New York on December 2nd. And finally, our Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault plans to participate in the Goldman Sachs U.S. financial services conference in New York on December 9th. Live, audio, webcast of each of these events will be made available to the general public through the American Express investor relations website at ir.americanexpress.com. Thank you again for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. Rochelle, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And that concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 2, "year": 2015, "date": "2015-07-22 00:00:00", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n I'll now turn the conference over to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nToby Willard: Thanks, Kathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.\n Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's other reports already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2015 earnings release, earnings supplement and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.\n Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we'll move to a Q&A session.\n With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome as well, Toby, to you as this is your first quarterly earnings call since you took over the leadership of our Investor Relations function from the capable hands of Rick Petrino a few months ago.\n Overall, our results this quarter reflected what we consider solid core underlying earnings performance. Reported Q2 EPS of $1.42 was relatively consistent with the prior year, while understanding our performance is more complex than usual this quarter for several reasons.\n As expected, the results reflected discrete impacts, including a significantly stronger U.S. dollar versus last year, the impact of various changes to our co-brand partnerships and the initial stages of a ramp-up in spending on growth initiatives.\n On a year-over-year basis this quarter, EPS growth was also impacted by the prior year net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and, of course, Business Travel's Q2 '14 operating results.\n Looking through the complexity of these items, our core underlying earnings performance was generally consistent with the financial outlook framework that we first shared with you at our Investor Day in March. We continue to view this framework as a useful way to understand the drivers of our performance through the period of the multiyear financial outlook we first provided in February this year. Accordingly, we have included this financial outlook framework as the first slide in our earnings presentation today.\n Looking at our results through this lens, we saw a revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and the prior year impact of Business Travel revenues. We built upon this revenue performance with disciplined expense control and the return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders. This solid core performance included making strong progress on some key initiatives. Highlights included the launch of the Plenti Loyalty Coalition Program in the U.S., the expansion of our OptBlue small merchant program in Canada, the rollout of 2 new Centurion airport lounges, refreshes of our Gold and Starwood's products, as well as the launch earlier this month of Amex Express Checkout, our online merchant checkout solution. As we expected, our solid core underlying performance was impacted by the discrete impacts from the strong dollar in FX, along with the changes in our co-brand partnerships.\n In terms of our spending on incremental growth initiatives, we are really just starting to ramp these up, and you will see them much more concentrated in the second half of the year. As a result of all this, while year-to-date our earnings are up approximately 5% versus last year, we would expect earnings per share for the second half of the year to be down versus the prior year, consistent with our discussions on Investor Day. For these reasons, our full year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect earnings per share for the full year to be flat to modestly down. Just where in this range we end up will be a function of the level of incremental spending we do during the second half of the year, along with our billings and revenue trends. \n We also believe our outlook, to return to positive earnings per share growth in 2016 and to be within our target range of 12% to 15% earnings per share growth in 2017, remains appropriate. As you recall, this outlook does not contemplate the impact of any restructuring charges or other contingencies.\n Now to turn to a high-level review of our financial results for Q2, as you can see on Slide 3, reported billings growth was 2%. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings grew 6%, significantly higher than our reported rate, but modestly slower than the first quarter. I'll provide more details on our billing performance shortly, but we did see some deceleration in volume growth in the U.S. that was partially offset by improving growth across most international markets.\n Reported revenue growth was down 4% due to the inclusion of Business Travel revenues in the prior year and the stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%. \n Net income was down 4% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the net benefit related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction and Business Travel operating income in Q2 '14, which together contributed approximately $0.08 to EPS in the prior year.\n Below the net income line, we made our first preferred dividend payment during the second quarter, which reduced EPS by approximately $0.02. \n We also continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 51 million common shares, which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This decline in shares outstanding benefited EPS, which was down only 1% versus the prior year, despite the 4% drop in net income. This performance resulted in an ROE of 28% for the period ended June 30, well above our on-average and overtime target of 25% and demonstrated the continued strength of our business model.\n Let's now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the second quarter, starting with billed business on Slide 4. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 7% in Q1 to 6% in Q2. As you can see, the primary driver of that decline is the U.S., where we saw growth of 5%, down from 6% in Q1. I'll provide more details on the drivers of the U.S. performance by segment in a few minutes.\n Across our international regions, we saw strong growth in JAPA, which was again the fastest-growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. \n We also saw improved performance in EMEA, where the growth in the U.K. remains in the double digits. The decline in volumes in the LACC region was driven by Canada, which is being impacted by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Outside of Canada, we are seeing improved performance in LACC, particularly in Mexico, where growth has accelerated during 2015.\n To turn to Costco in Canada for just a moment. While it is still early, we continued to be pleased by our efforts to capture the spend of the Costco co-brand card members. As you recall, in September 2014, we launched a new cash back card in Canada that was offered to former Costco Canada card members and it appears to be resonating well. Through the second quarter, we have been able to retain over half of the out-of-store spend related to the former Canadian Costco co-brand product.\n Now, I would pause here and highlight that this result is very specific to the Costco relationship in Canada and has little relevance to the U.S. As we said, the 2 situations are very different, with the most important distinction being that there was no portfolio sale in Canada. If you assume there was a portfolio sale in the U.S., it would have a profound impact on our ability to capture the spend and lend of the Costco card members in the U.S. Obviously, the sale itself automatically moves the card member relationship. \n In addition, as you might expect, when a portfolio is sold, there are likely to be contractual restrictions on what types of marketing activities the seller is permitted to engage in. We realize that all of you remain extremely interested in the status of our Costco co-brand portfolio sale discussions with Citi. The reality is this is a very complex transaction, and I can't comment on the specifics during the negotiation. I will remind you, though, that our contract with Costco imposes its own constraints on the sale process. We will, of course, abide by the contract, and we'll continue to update you as appropriate.\n To return to billings now and to provide you with some additional perspective on our international performance, we included Slide 5 this quarter, which shows total international volume growth with and without Canadian volumes on an FX-adjusted basis. As depicted by the green line on the slide, international volume growth, excluding Canada, increased to 13% during Q2, and this trend is being driven by improved performance across all of our international regions, excluding Canada.\n Looking at the results by segment on Slide 6. We saw a sequential decline in growth in GCS where billings were up 2% on an FX-adjusted basis. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see slower spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S.\n In our U.S. consumer and small business segment, we also saw some deceleration in growth to 6% in Q2. This performance continues to be impacted by gas prices, which were down 27% year-over-year. I would remind you that gas billings comprise about 2% to 3% of our volumes. The U.S. billings performance also reflects the current external economic environment, which remains uneven.\n Another driver of the sequential change in billings growth in the USCS segment was our Costco U.S. portfolio. Historically, Costco billings have tended to generally grow in line with the USCS average growth rate. But in the quarter, while still positive, Costco co-brand card growth rates slowed to well below the segment average. The slower growth is in part due to a decrease in new card acquisitions. As you would expect, during the wind-down period, we have agreed with Costco to reduce our joint marketing efforts.\n Turning to GNS. This continues to be our strongest billings growth segment, with FX-adjusted growth of 16% during the current quarter. This consistently strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model given the much higher-than-average returns on equity of the GNS business and the fact that more than 85% of GNS volumes are from international markets. And again, I'd remind you that the slower growth in ICS is being driven by the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada, which I just discussed.\n In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. Over the past year, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S., as you can see at the bottom of Slide 7.\n Looking at the comparison of our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth rates for the last 8 quarters, as you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on the slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with recent trends, in the 5% range. However, during the second quarter, foreign exchange had a slightly larger impact on our results than in Q1, dragging adjusted revenue growth down by 4 percentage points.\n As you know, this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we received from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the third quarter, but a smaller impact in Q4 as we begin to lap the significant strengthening of the dollar that occurred at the end of last year.\n Turning now to loans. You see on Slide 8 that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth continues to outpace the industry and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter at 7%. Looking forward, we continue to believe that there are attractive opportunities to gain a greater share of loans from both our existing and new customers without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company.\n Regarding the Costco loan portfolio in the U.S., which we consider, of course, to be a very high-quality portfolio, we have previously disclosed that it made up about 20% of worldwide loans as of the end of 2014. It remains at approximately 20% of worldwide loans today, though the growth rate in the portfolio is starting to slow in line with spending.\n On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and an expected decline in loans related to the Costco Canada co-brand portfolio.\n So putting it all together on the revenue side on Slide 9. You can see that revenues declined by 4% on a reported basis but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Business Travel revenues in the prior year. While this adjusted growth was consistent with last quarter, we did this quarter have a benefit related to certain merchant rebates accruals, and we also had some unfavorable timing impacts in the prior year. These items collectively benefited the year-over-year discount revenue growth rate and also resulted in a 1-basis-point increase in the reported discount rate versus the prior year. These specific impacts, as well as the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume, where we earned a much lower discount rate, more than offset the expected downward impact on the reported discount rate from growth in the OptBlue program and industry mix changes. \n I'd remind you that from quarter-to-quarter, individual merchant-related items can cause fluctuations in the reported discount rate. More broadly, we've said for a number of years that you should expect to see the reported discount rate decline 2 to 3 basis points a year on average due to changes in the mix of spending by location and industry; volume-related pricing discounts; competition; and more recently, growth of OptBlue, amongst other factors.\n Regarding OptBlue, we have been pleased with the progress we have made signing up merchant acquirers for the program and the pace at which those acquirers have added new merchants to our network. Year-to-date, we have signed up over 700,000 new merchants in the U.S. through OptBlue, and we are focused on driving card member spending to those incremental merchants.\n We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world, as evidenced by the launch of the OptBlue program in Canada this quarter.\n Coming back to our revenue performance more broadly. As we've seen in prior quarters, the gap between total discount revenue and total billed business growth was again impacted by GNS and cash rebate products growing faster than the company average.\n Before moving on, let me first touch on a couple other items on this slide, starting with the other key component of revenue, net interest income. Here we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio as well as lower funding costs. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income than on other revenue lines.\n Turning to net card fees, other commissions and fees and other revenue. These lines were all impacted to a greater extent by foreign exchange and also reflected growth in loyalty coalition revenue and some timing items in the prior year.\n As we discussed at Investor Day, the loyalty coalition business is one of our most important initiatives to find profitable growth in adjacencies, and we have been expanding the business into our acquisition of Loyalty Partner in 2011. The program is a tangible example of how we can leverage our digital capabilities to provide value for merchants while creating a new revenue stream for the company. \n During the quarter, together with our merchant partners, we were pleased to launch Plenti, our loyalty coalition program in the U.S. While it is still very early days, we have been encouraged by the initial response and the program already has more than 20 million total collectors.\n Moving now to credit performance on Slide 10. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels, with our write-off rates declining slightly versus last quarter and our delinquency rate remaining flat. As you can see on Slide 11, this steady lending credit performance as well as lower write-off rates in our charge card portfolio and benefits from FX helped to drive a 4% decline in provision versus the prior year. \n Though we experienced a year-over-year decline in provision this quarter, looking ahead, we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and represent a headwind to growth in the second half of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook an assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period.\n Shifting now to expenses on Slide 12. On a reported basis, expenses declined 4% versus the prior year. Clearly, there are a number of items impacting expense growth year-over-year, including the Business Travel joint venture-related items and Business Travel operating expenses in the prior year. Expenses also benefited year-over-year from the change in foreign exchange rates. I'll walk you through these impacts in more detail as we review marketing and promotion and operating expenses performance in a few moments.\n First, however, let me touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 1%, which was a bit slower than reported billed business growth. Growth this quarter does include a portion of the discrete impact from our renewed co-brand partnerships. However, that impact was more than offset by a decline in Membership Rewards-related expenses, in part due to an enhancement to the ultimate redemption rate estimation process in certain international markets that occurred last year.\n Turning to cost of card member services. You see a significant year-over-year increase of 26% consistent with the commentary provided last quarter. As you recall, a portion of the expenses in this line has increased as a result of our renewed co-brand partnerships, and we would expect these elevated levels of growth to continue for the remainder of 2015.\n Let's focus now on marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13 and make a few points. First, recall that last year in Q2, we leveraged the gain from the Business Travel joint venture transaction to support an elevated level of spend. Lapping this elevated level, along with this year's beneficial impact from FX, led to the decline of 21% you see year-over-year.\n Second, we have been clear since the Costco decision was made in February that we intend for spend on incremental growth initiatives during full year 2015 to be relatively similar with the elevated level we were at in full year 2014. This remains our intention. I would also point out that while the largest piece of this incremental spending will flow through the marketing and promotional line, a portion will also hit operating expenses contra revenue.\n Last. Looking at Slide 13, you see that we were still in the process of ramping up our initiatives in Q2. You should expect to see marketing and promotion expense increase substantially in the second half of the year.\n As we have said, the elevated level of spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we have across our company. It will support key initiatives, including acquiring new card members, gaining additional spend and lend from existing consumer small business and middle-market customers, expanding our presence internationally, growing our merchant networks in programs such as OptBlue, building our loyalty coalition business with things like the launch of Plenti in the U.S. and introducing new digital capabilities.\n Turning now to operating expense performance on Slide 14. Our reported results continued to reflect the impact of Business Travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line-by-line comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were significantly impacted by last year's items related to the creation of the Business Travel joint venture. Excluding expenses related to the Business Travel joint venture transaction, as well as expenses from Business Travel operations in 2014, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 5% in the quarter, aided in part by a benefit from FX.\n Moving to Slide 15. Adjusted operating expense growth year-to-date remains well below our 3% growth target. As Steve Squeri noted at our Investor Day in March, however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense control for a cutback in investment levels, but rather through ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization. \n We continue to make strategic investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. This is just one example. Earlier this month, we leveraged our unique technology and assets to launch Amex Express Checkout, which allows Amex card members to check out clearly and securely on merchant websites using their Amex login credentials.\n Looking ahead to the second half of the year, I point out again that a portion of the incremental spending on growth initiatives will hit operating expenses, including technology initiatives to enhance our small business and corporate capabilities.\n Now shifting to capital performance on Slide 16. During the current quarter, we returned 97% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining our already strong capital ratios. Our Q2 performance demonstrates our confidence in the company's ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength, and we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. \n Looking at the capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, I'd remind you that the greater year-over-year increase in the Tier 1 capital ratio was driven by our recent preferred issuances and we made our first dividend payment this quarter. This payment is recognized as a reduction of earnings available to common shareholders and, therefore, reduced our EPS by 1% during Q2.\n Let me now provide an update on the DOJ lawsuit before I conclude and take your questions. We are disappointed that our request for a stay of the decision in the injunction was denied this quarter. We have, of course, moved forward to comply with the trial court's remedy. As a result of the stay being denied, we can no longer enforce certain contractual provisions that prevent U.S. merchants from steering customers to use other credit and charge cards. We are appealing the trial court's ruling, because we believe it will not provide any benefit to consumers and will, in fact, harm competition.\n Steering is not a good thing for consumers, and we believe many merchants agree. At this point, given that the remedy just took effect earlier this week, it's too early to tell what the impact in the marketplace will be. We are staying focused on delivering value to merchants and deeply believe in the strength of our value proposition.\n I'd also remind you that there are a number of other private merchant litigation cases in the Eastern District of New York and other proceedings seeking monetary damages that will begin to progress as our appeal is being heard.\n So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results. Our results show solid core earnings performance built upon our financial model of having diversified growth businesses, disciplined expense controls and capital strength. While billed business growth overall slowed modestly from the first quarter, we saw positive momentum across many areas of our business, including international merchant acquisition and loyalty coalition.\n Going forward, given our 5% EPS growth year-to-date, simple math would indicate that EPS growth will have to be negative for the balance of the year to meet our continued outlook for full year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. As I mentioned, the biggest driver of where we will end up within this EPS range will be the level of incremental spending on growth initiatives over the balance of the year, as well as our billings and revenue trends.\n Going back to our Investor Day in March, we discussed our plan to leverage incremental spending in 2015 to help drive sustainable growth going forward. We continue to believe this is the appropriate long-term strategy, and also that we have a range of attractive growth opportunities. All this is also consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance will be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus is that on our full year earnings outlook, rather than our performance in any individual quarter.\n Stepping back, as we've discussed in multiple forums over the past couple of years, we, of course, have 3 on-average and over-time financial targets: generating EPS growth of 12% to 15%; a return on equity of 25% or better; and revenue growth of above 8%. Clearly, our top focus when we think about these targets is generating consistent EPS growth of 12% to 15%, which, in most environments, we have a fairly good track record of achieving over the 20-plus years that the targets have been in place. Our recent revenue performance has been below our aspirational 8% target, and we expect to remain below that level during the near term given some of the discrete impacts on our performance I noted earlier, as well as the current low inflation and low growth economic environment. \n However, when you think about our financial targets, the revenue target is just one of the facilitating levers that we use to help drive 12% to 15% EPS growth. We have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve our EPS target across a variety of different economic environments without having 8% revenue growth.\n In the context of our year-to-date results, we believe that our core earnings performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model, and that we are doing the right things to position the company for the long term.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Toby for some details on our Q&A session. \nToby Willard: Thank you, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session. [Operator Instructions] With that, the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. \nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I was trying to get a little bit more color on some of the commentary you had around retention of the Costco portfolio given the sale process and how we should think about a gain that might occur if, in fact, you sell the portfolio and you can't go after those customers. Could you just talk about how that affects the 2016 guidance? \nJeffrey Campbell: So all good questions, Sanjay. Thank you. So the points I was trying to make in my remarks were we can now give you a little bit information and are trying to help you understand what's going on in Canada where there was no portfolio sale, where we were able to reissue cards with, in fact, the same card number and where we're pleased that we're tracking to retain over half of the outer store spend. As I give people that detail, I think it's really important to realize that, that is a completely different situation from what may happen in the U.S. And if you assume there is a portfolio sale in the U.S. where all the card members are automatically moved to new cards from a new issuer. Then if you assume that in general, these contracts, to your point, Sanjay, have restrictions around marketing, I want to caution people that you would expect to get a very, very different outcome from what is happening in Canada and if that's the way the U.S. were to play out. When you think about a portfolio sale and assuming there\u2019s a gain, we've been, I think, consistent for quite some time in saying that we would use that gain, or at least portions of that gain, to help fund continued spending on a variety of growth initiatives. And when you think about our company and our growth opportunities, we have many, many opportunities to grow in every part of our business in every part of the globe. And so the efforts we may or may not make at times around Costco card members are just one small piece of what is a much broader pie of opportunities we see to really effectively continue to spend at elevated levels, marketing, promotion and certain other things. So I wouldn't overly try to tie, Sanjay, the elevated levels of spending with any particular segment, including the Costco segment. It's really an elevated level of funding that we are applying to the best opportunities we have, which occur all across our business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nKenneth Bruce: My question relates to marketing and promotion expense. You obviously are looking to increase that in the back half of the year. Looking back at some of the recent experience going back to 2010 and '11 where you really did increase spending pretty dramatically then to drive growth, it -- the levels that you accelerated spending at that time were considerably higher than what I think you're basically guiding to for the back half of the year. So I guess the question is do you think that taking up marketing and promotion expense to say somewhere in the 34, 35, 36 basis points per unit of billing is going to be sufficient to get to the growth you need to achieve your targets? And if I'm thinking about it wrong, is there a way to dimensionalize that? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I think the way I would think about it, Ken, it's a very good question, is we have a range of opportunities. On the other hand, we want to be really prudent about only focusing on those opportunities that offer really good returns for our shareholders. When you look at, in fact, one of the slides in the presentation today, which lays out the last 8 or 9 quarters of spending around marketing and promotion, I would say if you steer at that slide a little bit, it gives -- will give you a more realistic sense of the range of spending that we would consider elevated and that we would consider a range where we can, very efficiently and very effectively in today's environment, deploy all the dollars. I wouldn't -- I'd be cautious about going back and looking at analogies from 2010 and 2011. It's a very, very different situation. So I think if you look at that more recent set of histories and think about the highest levels, that's probably more what we think we can target and be really effective. \nOperator: We'll go next to James Friedman with SIG. \nJames Friedman: My question is about Europe and the changes in the interchange environment there. Just looking for some high-level thoughts on how you might characterize your strategy now that competitor cards have their interchange rates capped is do you see that as an opportunity going forward? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, it's a very good question, James. Let me step back and say clearly, as a general matter, we don't think regulation is a good thing for consumers and merchants and for this category. When you look at the European Union regulation and the final layout of it, it certainly confirms our view that most of the reforms are really targeted at addressing concerns around Visa and MasterCard's interchange practices. But as we've long said, the reality is there are always impacts in these situations on our business, some of which can create challenges for us. We've talked, in this particular case, in particular about the fact that there are some new cross-border dynamics that are putting some pressure on our discount rates in Europe. All that said, one of the strengths of our business model is we're out there every day having to prove our value to card members and merchants and every day evolving the way we work with both to demonstrate that value. That does give us an ability to flex and demonstrate our value in ways that others can't necessarily in this regulatory environment. So we are working hard to manage some of the negative impacts of the regulation and use other parts of it to find ways to be even more creative about adding value to merchants and our card members. And I would say, while, obviously, the legislation hasn't had any or much material impact yet, we're pleased with the results we see right now in Europe, and we're going to work really, really hard to try to continue those. \nOperator: Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nDavid Ho: Could you talk about some of the interest rate headwinds that you might face? And whether or not that's baked into the 2016 guidance? And what you may do as a company to offset some of those on-paper headwinds from the liability sensitive activity that you have currently? \nJeffrey Campbell: So good question, David. We, of course, are unusual in that a rising rate environment in isolation, if you hold everything else steady, is a negative for us and we put a number in our 10-K, just to use round numbers, that says for every -- all else being equal, 100 basis point rise in all interest rates will cost us around $200 million a year. When you look at the outlook we've provided, we built it -- we're trying to be realistic in that outlook and so we built a steadily rising rate environment into that outlook. For that matter, I'd remind you, we also built a little bit of steady uptick in some of the provision costs as well. So relative to our outlook, you would have to have a spike in interest rates that was much quicker and larger than what the general economic consensus has been to cause us to see any impact relative to that outlook. In terms of how we think about offsetting the impact of those rising interest costs, if you look historically, there is usually some natural hedge here because as a general matter, central banks and the Fed tend to raise rates more when there's a little bit stronger economic environment and raise it a little less when the economic environment is not so strong, and obviously, the rest of our business benefits tremendously when there's a little bit stronger economic environment. Beyond that, the reality is we -- the largest source of our position on our sensitivity to interest rates is the strength of our charge card franchise. We love that business. We think it's a great business. And so it just comes with this one aspect that we have to manage as interest rates, at some point, inevitably rise. \nOperator: And next, we have Craig Mauer with Autonomous. \nCraig Maurer: I wanted to ask if you could frame the OptBlue discussion a little bit differently. Versus your historical penetration versus Visa and MasterCard in the U.S. in terms of merchant coverage, how has the additional 70 -- 700,000 merchants helped you close that gap? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, there's -- yes, that's a good question, Craig. I think there's a couple aspects to this. So -- because you first have to close the actual coverage gap and then you have to make progress on closing the perception gap, and there's a time lag as you do both those things. So the program that we first began to talk about a little over a year ago was one where we said, boy, if you play out the incremental merchants that we think we can get, if you look at just the cycle of those merchants and how often they re-up the smaller merchants with acquirers, then you have a multiyear process here before we believe we can get to the point where, in fact, you signed on most merchants in the U.S. relative through a MasterCard, Visa. You could have a process that then extends beyond that to match that with perceptions and to drive card members to those merchants. If you think about the things I said a few minutes ago, as I pointed out, that we're really pleased with our progress this year on OptBlue and we've signed 700,000 new merchants under it, we also have to wait until you get them signed up, and then you have to go through a process to drive business to those merchants. And we're engaged in that, and we're certainly not to the point today where we would say that we have materially closed the coverage gap. So we're not going to go out and start talking about that until we've gotten further into this. So this is clearly a multiyear effort, because you're talking about a couple of million merchants you ultimately have to add onto the roll. And it's a multiyear effort to change perceptions, but we're really pleased with the way it's going. We feel strongly that when you take a multiyear view of this company, this is a really important part of our growth story, and we will continue to give you a sense each quarter of how it's going. \nOperator: We have a question now from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. \nMoshe Orenbuch: I was just wondering, I mean given the commentary you made about the opportunities for marketing, why did you wait 'til the second half? And could you talk a little bit about how some of the new products that you've been marketing and will be marketing, especially like the 6-3-1 rewards card will impact the profitability? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, all fair questions, Moshe. We went into 2015, as we began the year at January, with an assumption that we would be continuing our very long-term partnership with Costco, and we set marketing plans and we set budgets and we set the management teams off to execute on that plan. When we changed that plan in February and decided to go down a different path and concluded that we think in the long run we can generate more value for our shareholders with the path we've now gone down, we really had to do a little bit of a reset. And we manage the company for the long term. We want to be thoughtful when we choose to do something as dramatic as we've done, go to our shareholders and say we're going to ramp up spending this year and it's going to result in not a lot of earnings growth and, in fact, EPS could even be down a little bit this year. We want to be really thoughtful about the way we deploy those resources. And so while we began to deploy them in the second quarter to be as thoughtful as we wanted to be, the reality is it's taking us until the third quarter to get fully ramped up. So we think that's the right way to run the company, the right results. And as we said beginning back in February, we're stepping away a little bit from overly focusing on each individual quarter. \nMoshe Orenbuch: And the rewards -- the profit -- the impact on the rewards costs of the new products? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, look, the rewards environment in general has always been competitive and it's pretty competitive right now. What we really try to focus on, Moshe, are a couple of things. Number one, ultimately this is about broad customer value proposition. Rewards is one component of that. We have a brand. We have a reputation for security and trust and service. We try to leverage those things. Second, we have a very broad portfolio of products in the U.S., and we do that because we think there's tremendous value in making sure you're delivering to different customer segments the things they value the most, whether it be cash back rewards products; things that use our Membership Rewards program, which is of course, still by far the largest and most diversified rewards program; or our many co-brand products. And by focusing on the broader customer value proposition, by making sure we're being really thoughtful about how we segment the different customer groups and produce something that they're going to most highly value, we think we can get to the best possible result both for both our card members and our shareholders without having to compete dollar for dollar on every single aspect at every single product. So we feel good about some of the latest things we've launched, and certainly, the big launch in the last 12 months was around the EveryDay card last year. That card has performed better than we had anticipated. It has reached a little bit different demographic, which is exactly what we were trying to do and so we're pretty pleased with that. \nOperator: We'll go next to David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. \nDavid Hochstim: I wonder, with the benefit of another 3 months of analysis, if you could provide more color around the decline that we've seen in GCS billed business? And is weather a factor? Comparisons? What's the outlook for some improvement in the third quarter? And I guess really just wondering why that's declined so much far rapidly than USCS billed business, for example. \nJeffrey Campbell: So very good question, David. So 2 things. There was a sequential decline here, Q1 to Q2, from 4% to 2%. That decline actually relates to one product with actually maybe one large customer and it's an airline fuel-buying product, very, very low-margin product. As an old airline CFO, I'd point out the airlines are a little flush with cash right now, and so they're sort of minimizing their use of these products, which help them out with cash flow. That's what caused the drop from 4% to 2% as you go from Q2 to Q1. Now, 4% is still a low number. And as I said last quarter, boy, as we have really scrubbed all our customer base, all you can -- all I can tell you is it is U.S.-driven, not international markets. It is very broadly spread in terms of a slowdown in just the organic growth spending trends amongst our midsized and larger clients. It's T&E-oriented and hence, the very broad spread. So you can draw different conclusions from that: If there's companies tightening TV budgets as they think about the economic environment; is it a little bit of fare pressure on the airlines; lots of -- there'd be lots of different theories and you can add your own, but that's -- those are the facts as we see them. \nDavid Hochstim: Was there any change late in the quarter that would lead to a different trend in Q3? \nJeffrey Campbell: We're always very cautious, David, about reading too much into trends that occur over a couple of weeks. So I would say, no, we'll just have to see how Q3 plays out. \nOperator: Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. \nDonald Fandetti: Jeff, in terms of your American Express Checkout product, that was pretty interesting that you can use your existing ID and password. I was just curious what you found as you've rolled that out to merchants. Are you having to offer any type of economic incentive? I know some of the networks have suggested that it can be a little tricky to get their merchants to prioritize that. And how quickly do you think you can grow that penetration to your top merchants? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, of course, Don, it's very, very early days here. We have just announced the product. It's available with a small number of initial websites with a longer public list of people who will soon be adding it. Certainly, we have done some pilot sites before we launched it. And of course, the key here that everyone is trying to get to with these products is you're trying to get to a much higher percentage of people who go all the way through to the end and buy what they've been looking at in any particular online or mobile experience. And I would say we and the couple of merchants we had doing pilots with us were very encouraged by the results that we achieved in terms of improving those rates of getting people through to the final, final step. So when you think about the economic arrangements, I obviously can't comment on the specific arrangements, but what this is really about and the real pot of gold that everyone's chasing here is can you get those rates up significantly? And to the extent you can prove that you can, then, the economics take care of themselves for everyone. And that's what we're seeking here. Now, I'll go back to where I started. It's very early days and we're going to have to see how things progress here, but we are encouraged by the early results. We think we have a product with some very interesting features relative to some of the other alternatives. It is very simple, it is very quick, but we'll have to give you an update as time goes on. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery Scott. \nSameer Gokhale: So just a quick first question about the steering injunction, which became effective on the 20th of July. At this point, have you notified all merchants that they can, in fact, steer? Just wanted to get a sense for that. And then, in terms of earlier this year, there was a restructuring initiative involving 4,000 jobs and just wanted to get an update on that. Have you completed that restructuring with the 4,000 jobs? Just an update on that would be helpful. \nJeffrey Campbell: So let me take those one at a time. So let's start with the DOJ. So you are correct; the judge's order became effective at the beginning of this week, and we are in the process of following that order. One part of that process is notifying all of our merchants of their right to steer, and that will be happening, per the order, in the next several weeks. There's other aspects to it, but that's certainly one of the most important parts. As we think about the order, I think the first thing I would say is when you -- as we sit here and think about it today, we believe that in the near term, the financial impact of this order is within the financial outlook that we provided at Investor Day, reiterated it again today. Clearly, in the longer term, we're going to have to see how the marketplace reacts to the order and think about what impact that's going to have on our business modeling. So that's where we are with the DOJ. Much more straightforward question, yes, we took a restructuring charge last year that involves about 4,000 employees. We are well into that, however, there is still a significant portion still to come. Some of this involves fairly complex moves as we right-shore. Interestingly enough, a lot of this is moving from one non-U.S. location to another non-U.S. location. In some of our other operations, that has to be done very thoughtfully. And so there's a very experienced team that's doing this who is involved in that process, but they won't be done until much closer to the end of this year. \nOperator: We have a question now from Mark DeVries with Barclays. \nMark DeVries: Follow-up questions on what's embedded in your EPS growth guidance. What does it contemplate in terms of FX? Is it -- I'm assuming it's consistent with what you laid out, Jeff, for a fading headwind from FX in the fourth quarter. And if that's the case, does it assume no further appreciation in the dollar? And therefore, what might happen if we see continued dollar strength? And also, what happens if credit is more benign than you're thinking, and you don't see the provision ramp in the back half of the year? Could we expect that to fall to the bottom line? Or would you expect to kind of reinvest the benefits of that? \nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, 2 good questions. So on FX, essentially, what is built into our multiyear financial outlook, to use broad strokes, is roughly the rates you see today. And so to the extent -- because it's hard to imagine, these may be famous last words, that you could have another move as dramatic as you have had in the last 12 months beyond where we are today. If you do, that will be a tough headwind for us that we'll do our best to manage. I'd just remind you that the movement of the U.S. dollar so far, so fast against so many currencies all at once, as it's done in the last 9 months, you have to go back quite a number of decades to find another move like that. So it could happen but we'll have to see. On credit, you're correct; we built in both in the back half of this year, as well as into our '16 and '17 outlook, some modest and steady uptick in the provision and growth of the loan provisions. Clearly, we have a very steady track record now in growing our loans above the industry average. What happens if that is more benign? Well, that will be a very good thing. What I would say in terms of the bottom line is what we are trying to be true to at this point is the financial outlook that we've provided to people and making sure we are really well positioned to demonstrate and to execute upon once we've lapped all the FX, once we've lapped all the co-brand changes, once we've lapped Costco in the U.S., demonstrating to people that the business model and financial model that have produced 12 to 15 EPS growth rates, 12% to 15%, is in place and is working well. And so if credit is a little bit more benign, we will frankly look to see whether we are operating within the financial outlook that we have and whether we have other growth initiative funding that we, in fact, think it could be for our shareholders, very profitably redeployed or whether we want to take it to the bottom line to make sure we feel comfortable that we can come in with the kind of outlook we've provided. So boy, there's always a lot of moving pieces, we'll have to see where they all come out. But hopefully, Mark, that gives you at least some sense of how we will think about things. \nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. \nEric Wasserstrom: Jeff, it's Eric Wasserstrom. Just -- I just want to follow up on David Hochstim's question. One of the themes that's come out from the recent slate of bank reporting has been some enthusiasm after many quarters of maybe not so much enthusiasm about the growth in C&I, credit demand and the growing growth in middle-market demand. And to the extent that corporates now are demanding more credit, presumably to fund operations, do you think that, that potentially signals some pick up in spending in the middle market and corporate universe? \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, boy, Eric, I got to say, this is the one where I hope you're right and I hope that's a signal. But all I can do is tell you what we are seeing in our corporate business. And I'd remind you, it is a -- well, we do lots of things in the GCP segment, the biggest component is still tied to, more or less, T&E-oriented spend by mid- to large-sized companies. And so I have read some of those same comments that you just referenced. We'll have to see whether they show up in our results over time. Certainly through June 30, it would be hard to see that. \nOperator: That will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley. \nCheryl Pate: I just wanted to circle back to some of the earlier comments on OptBlue and sort of closing the perception gap. Can you just maybe help us think through? Is that increased signage with the merchants? Or is it more proactive with the card members? And then how would you tie that into -- I know we've talked about in the past the economics sort of moving to the positive on OptBlue at some point this year. \nJeffrey Campbell: Good question, and the answer, of course, is yes, it's sort of all those things. So there's a -- not to get overly tactical here, but you have to get the merchants signed up. The reality is we have trained, over many decades, our card members do look for little stickers in the window. And so you literally send teams of people out to make sure stickers are going up in the windows and that helps. There's an element of educating our card members. Now here, there's sort of a -- you have to think about the pacing and the timing. You wouldn't necessarily, if you were, Cheryl, an Amex card member, which I'm sure you are, of course, want to get an e-mail from us every single time we signed up any merchant within 10 miles of you because you'd get tired of seeing all the e-mails and you'd ignore them. So you kind of have to be thoughtful about when is the right time to communicate in the most impactful way to our card members and when do you make sure you're doing that soon enough so the merchants who sign up start to see Amex card members and feel good about what they've done. So there's no magic here. It's a matter of balancing some of those basic blocking and tackling things we need to do, but we're very focused on it. I'll go back to that's why I said so far this year, we're pleased with all the sign-ups and we are very focused now on continuing the sign-ups but also beginning to drive more business to those merchants. I would say we are -- remain on track for this year for the program overall to be a positive to our bottom line, when you look at the net of all the positives and negatives, and we are tracking to our plan over a couple of years to much more significantly close the coverage gap.\n So Cheryl, thank you for that last question and thanks to everybody for joining us on tonight's call. I guess I'd go back probably to where I started and where I ended earlier, which is there is a lot of complexity in our results but we think that this quarter does, again, reflect solid core underlying performance. \n With that, I will wish you all a good evening and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. \nOperator: Thank you.

We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. Overall, Q1 was a solid quarter for the Company consistent with the framework and financial outlook we presented at Investor Day last month. The quarter reflected solid core underlying performance as well as several discrete impacts including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and various changes to our cobrand relationships. As you recall, we discussed at Investor Day our expectations for the first quarter and in fact EPS growth of 11% did come in better than our full-year outlook and even a little better than we thought a few weeks ago, in part due to the timing of our incremental spending on growth initiatives which will ramp up over the course of the year along with some other timing benefits that we don\u2019t expect to repeat as we go through the year. I\u2019ll discuss these items in more detail later in my remarks. Importantly for these reasons, our full-year 2015 EPS outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. Looking back to the financial outlook framework from Investor Day, our core underlying performance remains consistent and continued to be driven by solid revenue growth of 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year, disciplined cost controls and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of repurchases over the past year. Our results also reflect some of the discrete impacts that we discussed a few weeks ago. In the cobrand space, we are seeing the impact from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada as well as the reset impact from the early renewals we have done with several other cobrand partners including Delta, Starwood and Cathay Pacific. In addition, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the first quarter and represented a significant headwind to our quarterly earnings performance. Importantly, during the quarter we also continued to have strong momentum on key initiatives, highlights included the expansion of our small merchant coverage through OptBlue, the announcement of the Plenti loyalty coalition program in the U.S., the signing of the new Charles Schwab cobrand along with the renewal of our cobrand relationship with British Airways in Iberia as well as the announcement just today of our new wearable payments partnership with Jawbone. We were also very pleased by our strong 2015 CCAR performance which will provide us with the flexibility to increase our dividend and share repurchases going forward. As we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that these developments are indicative of the many attractive opportunities for growth as we have over the longer-term. So that is the quarter and a simple summary. So we get into the detail, I will warn you that lasting the impact the 2014\u2019s Global Business Travel and Concur transactions along with the 2015 discrete impact of FX and our cobrand changes all combined to make understanding our results this year a bit more complex than usual. To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you can see on slide two, reported billings growth was 3%. Like many other global companies, the strength of the U.S. dollar had a significant impact on our growth rates this quarter. As the dollar continued to strengthen, the magnitude of the FX impact increased and for the first quarter depressed our growth by nearly four percentage points. As a result, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, significantly higher than our reported rate. I\u2019ll provide more details on our billings performance shortly, but lower gas prices in the U.S. and the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada clearly had an impact on our results. Reported revenue growth of negative 3% was of course also impacted by FX as well as the inclusion of business travel revenues in the prior year. Excluding these items, adjusted revenue growth was 5%, consistent with both the prior quarter and recent trends. Net income grew by 6% helped by disciplined expense control and lower provision costs, both of which also reflected some timing benefits in the quarter which helped to offset the discrete impacts of FX and the changes in our cobrand relationships. Below the net income line, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to provide significant returns to our shareholders. Over the past year, we have repurchased 48 million shares which translated to a 4% decline in average shares outstanding. This declined in shares outstanding along with the modestly lower tax rate drove the 11% diluted EPS growth that we generated during the first quarter. This performance also resulted in an ROE of 29% for the period ending March 31, well above or on average and over time target of 25% and demonstrates the continued strength of our business model. Let\u2019s now move to a more detailed review of our key performance drivers during the first quarter, starting with billed business on slide three. On an FX adjusted basis, billings growth slowed modestly from 8% in Q4 to 7% during the quarter. Looking at the results by segment, in our U.S. consumer and small segment growth also decelerated slightly to 7% in Q1. This performance was impacted by the more than 30% decline in gas prices year-over-year as well as slower retail sales growth, consistent with industry wide trends in the U.S. I would note that in the U.S. we did not see any material impact on our billings growth from the announced termination next year of our relationship with Costco. As you would have expected however, we have started to see some slowing of new Costco cobrand card acquisitions which along with any future customer behavior changes that we may experience will likely begin to impact our performance somewhat later this year. It\u2019s also worth noting on billings that the deceleration in Q1 was more pronounced in our GCS segment or billings were up 4% on an FX adjusted basis as we seem to see a slowdown in spending across a number of corporate customers, primarily in the U.S. GNS continues to be our strongest billings growth segment with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the quarter. This continued strong growth demonstrates the diversity of our business model, given the much higher than company average returns on equity we achieved in the GNS business. Finally, ICS FX adjusted growth was 2% during Q1, but as we began to see last quarter, we saw very different trends by region, as you can see on slide four. The slowdown in international regions came primarily from LACC where volumes were down 4% versus the prior year, driven by a drop-off in Canadian billings. As you recall, we began to see volume slow in Canada during Q4 when card acceptance at Costco in Canada was expanded to include other networks. Beginning January 1st, American Express products were no longer accepted in Costco warehouses in Canada and we are now seeing that full impact from the termination of this relationship on billed business. In contrast to LACC, we saw improved growth in the JAPA region which was again the fastest growing region in the quarter, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. This solid performance continued to be powered by strong growth in China and Japan. In all international regions, you see that like other U.S. companies with a significant global footprint, our reported results are being significantly impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. To provide you with some additional perspective here, on slide five, we have again included a comparison of our reported and FX adjusted revenue growth rates for the last eight quarters. As you can see in the trajectory of the blue dotted line on this slide, our adjusted revenue growth remains consistent with the recent trends in the 5% range. However, during the first quarter, foreign exchange had a more significant negative impact on our results than in prior periods, driving adjusted revenue growth down by nearly four percentage points. At current FX rates, we would expect to see a similar drag in the second quarter. As you can see in the second row, the bottom of the chart, the dollar has strengthened by 10% to 30% year-over-year against the currencies that we are most exposed to outside the U.S. Now of course this revenue impact is partially offset by the benefit we receive from having certain expenses denominated in international currencies, but there is a bottom-line impact, especially when rates move this dramatically. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that being a global company that generates revenue in a diverse set of markets around the world is a strength of our business model. As we discussed at Investor Day however, if the current rates hold, FX will continue to have a significant discrete impact for the balance of the year. Turning now to loans, you see on slide six that worldwide loans were up 4% versus the prior year. Consistent with historical seasonal trends, we did see a drop-off in loan balances versus year-end and a small sequential increase in net interest yield during the first quarter. In the U.S. which constitutes the majority of our loan portfolio, growth was relatively consistent to the prior quarter at 7%. On the international side, reported loan balances were down year-over-year due to the negative impact from FX rates and the decline in loans related to the Costco Canada cobrand portfolio. Stepping back, our loan growth has consistently been above the industry over the past two years. And we talked at Investor Day about the opportunity to continue the strength by growing share with existing card members as well as attracting new customers to our franchise. Having said this however, I\u2019d also remind you that net interest income this quarter still made up only 18% of our total revenues. And given the expected run-off in loans associated with the Costco U.S. cobrand portfolio next year, even if we continue to grow our core loan portfolio with the higher rates we have seen, our overall business model will remain very spend focused. So now putting together, our billings and loan performance, you see on slide seven that revenues declined 3% on reported basis but increased by 5% after adjusting for FX and business travel revenues in the prior year. I\u2019ll note that revenue growth during the current quarter does reflect a portion of the negative impact from our cobrand partnership early renewals as well as a larger impact versus Q4 from the termination of our relationship with Costco in Canada. Even with these discrete impacts however, adjusted revenue growth of 5% is consistent with recent trend, illustrating the ongoing strength of our underlying core business. The two largest components of revenue are of course discount revenue and net interest income. To start with the former, during the first quarter, discount revenue grew by 1%, which was approximately 200 basis points below the reported growth in billed business of 3%. The first driver of this difference was a decline in our reported discount rate, which was down 2 basis points versus the prior year. This year-over-year decline is slightly smaller than in recent quarters, in part because the decline in Costco Canada merchant volume where we earned a much slower discount rate, actually raises the company average discount rate. The discount rate also reflects continued growth in our OptBlue program, as merchant acquirers actively sign up new merchants onto the American Express network. As Ed discussed at Investor Day, 14 of the top 15 merchant acquirers in the U.S. are now part of OptBlue. Last year when Anre Williams introduced this new program to you at the February financial community meeting, he said that we expect to increase our small merchant acquisition by 50% and more for the next several years, starting in 2015. And while this is obviously a multiyear effort, we in fact signed more than 400,000 new small merchants last year in 2014. So, we are clearly off to a good start. We are also undertaking similar efforts to improve our small merchant coverage in many other markets around the world. Also contributing to the gap between discount revenue and billed business growth was faster growth in both GNS volumes and the Concur revenue items, including cash incentives and certain payments related to our renewed cobrand relationships. Turning to the other key component of revenue, net interest income, we saw a healthy 8% growth rate driven by our continued efforts to grow our loan portfolio, as well as lower funding cost. As the majority of our loan portfolio is in the U.S., the impact of FX is smaller on net interest income and on other revenue lines. Moving now to credit performance on slide eight. You can see that our lending credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels and that our write-off and delinquency rates both remained relatively consistent with recent trends. As you can see on slide nine, despite this steady lending credit performance, provision expense dropped 13% versus the prior year. Typically we experienced the reserve release during Q1 due to the seasonal decline in loans and receivable balances versus year end. The increase in the reserve release versus the prior year is largely to due to charge cards with the prior year period included a modest reserve build. Moving to our lending reserve coverage levels on slide 10, coverage remained relatively consistent, after considering the impact of the seasonal decline in loans and receivables I just mentioned. We believe coverage levels remain appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. Thinking about the balance of the year, it is important to note that we would expect reserves to build modestly in line with loan growth and any changes in credit performance. Therefore, we would expect provision to increase year-over-year and to represent a headwind to growth for the remainder of 2015. Moreover, as we discussed at Investor Day, we did build into our multiyear financial outlook and assumption that we would see some steady upward tick in write-off rates and a modest build in reserves over the outlook period. Moving below revenue now to expenses on slide 11. On a reported basis, expenses declined by 5% versus the prior year. Excluding business travel expenses incurred in 2014, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% and also of course benefitted somewhat from the strength of the U.S. dollar. I\u2019ll come back to operating expenses in marketing and promotion at a knock. First however, I\u2019ll touch on a few other items on this slide. Rewards expense grew by 4%, which was relatively consistent with our reported billed business growth. And rewards expense in the current quarter does include a portion of the discreet impact from our renewed cobrand relationships. The resultant increase in our rewards costs however was partially offset by some timing benefits this quarter related to our membership rewards program. Next, while it\u2019s a relatively small percentage of total expenses, cost of card member services increased significantly year-over-year by 18%. As background, a portion of the expenses in this line are related to the payments we may provide partners for services such as baggage fees, companion tickets and airport lounge access, which have increased as a result of our renewed cobrand relationships. For the remainder of 2015, given the Q1 of last year also included elevated costs in cost of card member services, we would expect to see an even higher level of growth for this line item. Lastly on slide 11, the tax rate during the first quarter was 34%, which was relatively consistent with recent quarters, but slightly below the prior year. As we mentioned at Investor Day, our assumption is that the tax rate will remain roughly in line with recent performance during 2015. Let\u2019s turn now to marketing and promotion expenses which accounts for the majority of our spending on growth initiatives. Slide 12 shows the trend of these costs. And you see that while this quarter\u2019s marketing and promotion expenses were 4% higher than the prior year, you\u2019ll also notice that these costs have historically been much slower during each year\u2019s first quarter. More broadly, as we think about 2015, we continue to evolve our plans around the timing and level of incremental spending on growth initiatives. As we have said, the majority but not all of this spending will occur in marketing and promotion. Considering this, we would expect marketing and promotion expenses to be relatively similar with the elevated levels of 2014, which you can see on the slide included higher levels of expenses in Q2 when we have the business travel joint venture transaction gain and in Q4 when we had the Concur gain. While we could have made the decision to reduce investments from their elevated 2014 levels, as we discussed at Investor Day, we believe that the right decision for shareholders to best position the Company for the medium to long-term is to keep investments at an elevated level this year in anticipation of the termination of our relationship with Costco in the U.S. during early 2016. As Ken, Ed and Steve discussed in detail a few weeks ago, the incremental spending in 2015 will focus on the many growth opportunities that we see across all segments in our Company including our efforts to capture a meaningful portion of the spend and lend of our Costco card members in the U.S. Turning now to operating expense performance on slide 13, our reported results continue to reflect the impact of business travel in the prior year across a number of expense categories, complicating line by line comparisons. That said, excluding business travel expenses incurred in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses in total decreased by 2% in the quarter. I\u2019ll also note that during the quarter, we benefited from some specific items in the other net line which we do not expect to repeat going forward. As you think about the balance of the year, I\u2019d also point out that operating expenses have historically been lower during Q1. Moving to slide 14, adjusted operating expense growth of course remained well below our stated 3% growth target. As we discussed at Investor Day, maintaining disciplined control of our expense, particularly operating expenses remains a key driver of our earnings performance. As Steve noted that day however, we are not achieving this disciplined expense controls or a cutback in investment levels but rather to ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of the organization, we continue to make substantial investments within operating expenses to support our growth initiatives. Now shifting to our capital performance on slide 15. During the current quarter, we returned 65% of the capital we generated to shareholders while strengthening our already strong capital ratios. As I mentioned at Investor Day, share repurchases of approximately $750 million for the first quarter were below the amount included in our 2014 CCAR submission due to some nuances in 2014 CCAR rules associated with the capital generated by employee plan. These rules have evolved for future CCAR periods but did cause our Q1 payout ratio to be somewhat lower than in recent quarters. I also point out that the 2015 CCAR process gives all participants more flexibility on the timing of share repurchases across the five-quarter CCAR approval period. Accordingly, the exact timing and size of our repurchases in 2015 will be driven by many factors including but not limited to the levels of our earnings and the demand for other capital uses. Looking at our capital ratios on the bottom of the slide, you see a more significant increase year-over-year in our Tier 1 capital ratio. This was driven by the $1.6 billion in preferred issuances we executed during the last two quarters. As a reminder, we will see the EPS impact from the dividend payments associated with these issuances beginning in Q2. These payments will reduce our net income available to common shareholders by approximately $20 million each quarter. Stepping back from these quarterly results, our strong relative performance in the 2015 CCAR process and the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan clearly illustrates the strength of our capital position and business model. This reinforces our confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to generate capital while maintaining its financial strength. And we remain committed to using that capital strength to create value for our shareholders. Before moving on to your questions, let me make just a few final comments. Stepping away from the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results, we believe that our core underlying performance this quarter was solid and reflected the continued strength of our business model and the trends we discussed last month at Investor Day. Earnings per share growth of 11% was better than our full year 2015 outlook in part due to some specific benefits in Q1, most notably in provision and operating expenses and also because we have not yet seen a ramp up in incremental spending on growth initiatives. Clearly, given our 11% EPS growth in Q1, simple math would indicate that EPS growth would have to be negative for the balance of year to meet our continued outlook for full-year EPS growth to be flat to modestly down. Looking at the second quarter in particular, I would remind you that you will begin to see the impact from our recent preferred share issuances and that the prior year EPS of the $1.43 included in that benefit from the business travel joint venture transaction, considering this while it is obliviously very early in the quarter, we would expect earnings per share in Q2 to be more significantly down from last year. All this is consistent with our previous comments that quarterly earnings performance would be more uneven than it has been historically while we go through this transitional period. Given this dynamic, our focus has been on our full year earnings outlook rather than our performance in any individual quarter. When we consider our Q1 performance and our Q2 comments in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we believe we are on track and are continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long-term. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick for some details on our Q&A session.\nRick Petrino: Thanks Jeff. As a reminder, in order to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the call, I will ask that those in the queue please limit yourself to just one question. Thanks for your cooperation in this process. And with that operator, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. I guess my question will be on Costco Canada. I know you guys have addressed it throughout the last couple of times you\u2019ve spoken. But now that you have a full quarter\u2019s worth of experience at Costco Canada, could you maybe just talk about you know your ability to retain spending on those customers\u2019 cards and how you think it reflects, relative to your strategy in the U.S.? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Sanjay for the question. Maybe let me start by providing just a little bit of context for Canada because we\u2019ve given a fairly unusual amount of color around the U.S. where we pointed out that that relationship consists of about 70% of the cobrand spend being out of store, also talked about the cobrand in the U.S, accounting for about 8%of global billings. To draw a contrast to Canada, in Canada, the Costco cobrand and Costco as a merchant represented a more significant portion of our country total billings in Canada. The other probably two very important differences to point out to you are that the portion of spend on the Costco Canada cobrand that was in store was much higher, it was about 60% in store and of course in Canada there was no sale of the portfolio. So with all that as context, you are correct that this is the first full quarter since the termination of acceptance of Amex products in Canada on January 1st. As you would expect that means all of the in store spend goes away. But we, while it\u2019s still early, I would say continue to be pleased as you now heard us say in a couple forums, by our efforts to capture the spend and lend of the Canadian Costco card members. And of course in Canada, we did issue a new cash back card. As you would expect we are very focused on those customers who clearly have an affinity with the American Express brand. And I\u2019d say there have been significant learnings and we are encouraged by them and we are being very thoughtful about how we will apply them in the U.S. As you would expect Sanjay, I probably don\u2019t want to provide a lot of color and detail beyond that general statement, but we are encouraged on quarter end.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Don Vendetti with Citigroup.\nDon Vendetti: Yes Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about a potential gain from the Costco sale. I mean sometimes these portfolios can trade for 15% plus premiums. And can you talk about some of the offsets and how that may also impact your capital return, given that you\u2019re able to return more than 100% in the CCAR?\nJeff Campbell: Couple of comments, I really, in terms of the progress potential outcome, Don, on any portfolio sale, I can\u2019t really comment beyond what we\u2019ve already said, which is we\u2019ll just have to see -- there\u2019s a process and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. In terms of the financial outlook, we have provided, I would remind everyone that we did not include any assumption about a gain on the sale of the portfolio. So any gain would be incremental to the outlook we laid out. When you think about capital implications, obviously if there is a portfolio sale, there\u2019s a significant reduction in risk weighted assets, that\u2019s the Costco U.S. loan portfolio as we previously talked about constituted about 20% of our global loan portfolio. That in and of itself depending upon how quickly we ramp our efforts elsewhere to replace that spend, that of course frees up some capital. And to the extent there is a sale and there is a gain, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019d have to look at the timing and amount of any gain and think about what portion of it we might want to use to make sure we\u2019re fully funding our efforts to capture the future spend and lend from our relationships with the Costco card members and what portion should drop to the bottom line. Clearly, we have a very strong balance sheet already. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a very strong and steady commitment to using that balance sheet to return capital to shareholders. It\u2019s also fair to say though that the nature and timing of the CCAR process means there is often a lag between big developments that impact capital and our ability to run them through the CCAR process. So, we\u2019ll kind have to see how this plays out. But hopefully that gives you a sense Don of how we\u2019re thinking about the various components.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ho: Good afternoon. Can we talk about the expense ramp in specifically what areas you\u2019re investing, particularly as we saw in the second quarter and maybe this quarter as well? And how are they different than some of the areas that you have invested in previous years and in particular coalition partners and do you expect the Costco USA build to accelerate towards the end of the year versus the middle part of the year.\nJeff Campbell: Good question, David. Let me make a few comments. One of the reasons why we have continued to talk a little bit about an expectation that you will see more quarterly unevenness in our earnings is we think the prudent thing here is to be a little flexible around the timing at amounts that we choose to spend around one of the things that we will be ramping our growth spending initiative, our growth initiative spending on and that\u2019s focusing on the capturing a future spend and lend from our relationship with Costco card members. It\u2019s very complex process between now and 2016 that will play out in that relationship. And we need a little bit of flexibility that will determine when we choose to ramp up some of our marketing efforts and when we do. Certainly that is one of the elements though when you think about what is different this year, potentially next year about the range of things that we do growth spending on. We have a very rich pool of very dedicated American Express card members and we will do our best to capture their future spend and lend. The second thing I might point out for 2015 is we are very excited about the launch of Plenti, since you brought coalition. As you would imagine or as you recall, we have a pretty well drawn track with the loyalty coalition business as we\u2019ve launched that in other countries for understanding the flows from the first year of launch which is more of an investment year and has as the program that matures in the coming years. So, it\u2019s fair to say that we want to make sure this is a really strong launch and we\u2019re putting a lot of resource towards that in 2015. And that\u2019s probably a little different in terms of the profile that you would have seen last year and a little different than what you will see next year as the progress moves beyond the launch phase. Beyond those two things, I would say, really that we will be investing in the range of growth opportunities we have across the Company; we tried to do a pretty thorough overview of those at Investor Day and really expand the Company. So, you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in some of the international markets where we\u2019ve seen particularly high rates of growth. Basically you\u2019ll see us continue to invest around our small business and middle market efforts. You will see us continue to invest in some of the areas where we believe expanding the breadth of the demographic that our brand reaches out to is producing new opportunities and you will see us continue to do some things that we think will drive the steady growth in lending that you\u2019re seeing above industry averages. So that\u2019s probably how we think about the spending overall.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening, Jeff. Could you clarify for us what cost of equity or hurdle rate you use when evaluating new investment opportunities? And can you also discuss how your hurdle rates might differ across your different businesses including for example cobrand, particularly since it seems like your GNS and charge card businesses generate structurally higher returns and are big driver of that 25% plus return target that you have? I don\u2019t think you guys have discussed that in the past but I do think it could be helpful to the extent you can give some kind of indication would be helpful for investors to assess the risk that people have been worried about that you could lose, continue to lose future partnerships to competitors who are willing to accept lower returns?\nJeff Campbell: Bill, that\u2019s a good and actually very important question. So, we have a range of businesses across American Express and of course we have a fairly unique business model in our core business. That range of businesses and that business model produce a tremendous return on equity relative to most of our peers in financial services. And so, we are thrilled that we have an ROE which this quarter was 29% and we have really strong track record in meeting our more than 25% target. And I think it\u2019s a real commentary on the strength of more business model. But we shouldn\u2019t confuse that with hurdle rates for incremental investments or for how we think about bidding for business. Because of course if we really look at our cost of capital, you will of course get to numbers far, far below 25%. And I can spend the rest of the call getting philosophical, but exactly how you might calculate our cost of capital when we look at it, as you would expect in many ways, but suffices to say it is much below 25% and it is somewhere around the 10% range depending on which measure you want to look at. And when we are thinking about incremental opportunities in a bidding situation, I don\u2019t really believe that we would take a different economic choice based strictly on a hurdle rate. Now, we do make choices based on the next part of your question though which is we do have a range of opportunities in our business. And we generate a range of returns on equity and a range of returns on an incremental dollar of expense spending as well. And so, when we think about opportunities, we\u2019re always making sure that anything we do is going to generate incremental value for our shareholders and be above our returns on capital, but we also have to think about the range of opportunities in the financial and managerial resources that we have to allocate across those opportunities. And one of the things you heard us talk a fair amount about going all the way back to the February 2012 investor call that Ken and I had on Costco is as we thought about where we were with Costco, one of the things we really thought about was the range of other opportunities we have; some of the non-financial constraints that a future contract might have entailed. And when we baked all of those things together, we came to the conclusion that in a long run, we would be better off pursuing another path. But I think it would be a real misnomer for anyone to conclude from that that oh! American Express is never going to pursue a transaction or piece of business that has a return on equity below 25%, so they are not competitive. Our job is to create value for our shareholders. And of course I\u2019d like to create it at the highest possible ROE and I\u2019d like to create it in the highest possible parts of our business. But if I can create a new chunk of business at something that is closer to our hurdle rate, we will absolutely of course pursue that business if it\u2019s the best alternative in the long run for the company.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery.\nSameer Gokhale: Hi, thank you. My question was about your loss provisions and the reserve release. Jeff, you provided a bit of an explanation. I think you talked about the provisioning, the reserve release being more related to charge cards, I think this quarter, if I heard you correctly. But it just seems like between last quarter and this quarter there seem to be a lot more volatility than we\u2019ve seen I think at least in recent quarters; recent years between Q4 and Q1. So, were there any changes made to any underlying assumptions that would drive this kind of volatility? So, if you could just parse that out a little bit that would be helpful.\nJeff Campbell: It\u2019s a very accurate description, Sameer I think of where we are in the last couple of quarters. I would have to call this quarter\u2019s provision one that is certainly off the normal trend. I talked in my remarks about the fact that of course, you have a normal Q4 to Q1 decline in your loan and receivable balances and that does generally drive a seasonal therefore decline in your reserves and that happened this year, as it did last year. However, you have a combination of the fact that last year\u2019s first quarter had a few various more specific items that happen to drive that number up; a little bit this quarter, we had some of the kind of specific adjustments for items that you have every quarter in the provision that happen to drive it down a little bit. You put those two together and you suddenly get a really big year-over-year difference. I think the more which is why I also in my remarks tried to point people to I think the more important thing to think about here is, as we look at the rest of 2015, in the current economic environment, we expect layoff trends to stay pretty strong. However, we\u2019ve been steadily growing our loan balances and you would expect reserves to build along with those loan balances. And some of these specific items that drove the Q1 results, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect to repeat. So you put all that together and I would expect to see provision going up year-over-year in 2015. And I would also just remind you that in terms of what assumptions, we made in the financial outlook we\u2019ve given for 2016 and 2017, we did assume in 2016 and 2017 that you do see some modest uptick in write-off rates and hence provision and reserves.\nOperator: The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Jeff, can you just clarify in terms of the \u201816 broad guidance that you gave back in February and related at the recent Investor Day, does it contemplate the foregone net interest income from a sale of Costco portfolio, that\u2019s really I suppose?\nJeff Campbell: That\u2019s a good question, Eric. And what I would say is that because we can\u2019t be completely sure of the timing and outcome of any potential portfolio sale, we built an outlook for 2016 which we think we can achieve under a range of potential outcomes for the portfolio. And we\u2019ve built an outlook that to be exclusive does not include any potential gain on a sale. So, we think as a matter what assumption you might want to make about the resolution around the portfolio, we think we have enough levers in our business to hit the outlook we\u2019ve given for 2016. Now certainly there are some things that could drive you above that. If there is a gain on a sale for example that is clearly not in our outlook and would be incremental, but we just don\u2019t know enough about the final outcome and the timing of the final outcome to be specific beyond the comments I just made.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Cheryl Pate with Morgan Stanley.\nCheryl Pate: Just wanted to touch on billed business a little bit and if we can split it up into international and U.S. On the international side, I was just wondering if you could maybe spend a minute on how you think about potential hedging strategies to help offset some of the headwinds. And then on the U.S. side, if you could provide a bit of color for how you\u2019re thinking about trends as we look at the rest of 2015 and on top of that potential to maybe take some share with OptBlue similarly tracking a bit ahead of expectations? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Let me take those one at a time, Cheryl. On hedging, so we do some foreign exchange hedging but it\u2019s really about frankly helping us have a clear view from a planning perspective within a quarter. It helps us know what the FX impact is going to be. In essence at the beginning of a quarter we do a bunch of hedging that unwind as you get to the end of the quarter. So, you\u2019re not further impacted by anything that happens in the quarter. That obviously has zero impact on our longer trend or on the year-over-year declines. And as we think about doing any other kind of strategy longer term to hedge, our conclusion at the end of the day is that, we think there is value in the diverse set of global businesses we have we think in the long run; the currencies go up and down and tend to equilibrate over time and that the frictional costs and frankly the volatility that the accounting drives for any longer term hedging strategy has caused us to shy away from it. So that\u2019s how we think about hedging. On the U.S., obviously we\u2019ll have to see where the economy goes as we get into the rest of the year. I think it\u2019s fair to say from our experience in the first quarter, we haven\u2019t started to see estimates of GDP growth in the U.S. or elsewhere, but I think when we look at our own experience and some of the external data around retail sales and we look at what\u2019s happening to gas prices, when we look at some of the immediately somewhat anecdotal stories we hear in our corporate card business, it suggests to us that it was certainly not the most robust of quarters for economic growth. So really in that environment for us to want to adjust for FX in last year\u2019s business travel, get to 5% revenue growth, we actually feel pretty good about. When you think about the rest of the year, you\u2019re correct. I mean we\u2019re up about OptBlue; it is a multiyear effort. I want to be clear that when Anre Williams on our team first talked about it at the February financial community meeting last year, we talked about it in the context of sort of 2015 to 2017. In that vein, we are encouraged that we actually signed up 400,000 merchants in 2014 and that was sort of before we told you, we start to ramp the program much. So we do think as we get into the latter part of 2015 that we should begin to see a meaningful benefit from OptBlue and we remain very encouraged by it. We obviously remain very encouraged by lots of other things in the market. Our steady growth in the U.S. of growing our lend portfolio, we expect to be able to continue and we think we\u2019re doing that without materially changing the risk profile of Company by really focusing on capturing a fairer share of our card member spend. We\u2019re excited about our continued efforts around broadening the reach of the brand with things like the everyday card and we\u2019re excited about things like Plenti. And if you haven\u2019t focused on it, I\u2019ll point out to you, we are going to launch a Plenti cobrand which we think will be a very interesting play as just one more step on our pathway of broadening the demographic reach of the brand and the franchise. So, we\u2019ll have to see where the economy goes and what the environment does but those are probably some of the things we\u2019re thinking about as we look at the rest of the year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. \nCraig Maurer: Good evening. Just a fast question, the sharp decline, or not the sharp decline but slowing in commercial card spend; if you could first tell us where or in what parts of the economy you\u2019re seeing that weakness most clearly? And secondly, historically in talking to Amex, we\u2019ve discussed corporate spend trends, leading consumer spend trends by about six months. Do you still think of that as a good relationship that the slowdown in commercial could be forecasting a slowdown in consumer toward the back half of the year? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, it\u2019s a good question Craig. Let me just remind everyone of the facts. So, what it does to us as well, strike us is that in the corporate card segment you saw a sequential slowing from 8% in Q4 to 4% in Q1 and that\u2019s clearly a much sharper sequential slowing that you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. As we have dug into that a little bit, it is primarily driven by the U.S. and seems to be a little bit more striking in our larger accounts in the U.S. In terms of what this means for the broader economy six months from now, I guess I\u2019d be cautious. One, if you look at corporate spending, it tends to be a little more volatile than some of our other segments because companies who\u2019ve gotten pretty good over the years are turning on and off their travel spends and other T&E spend in response to their own business challenges in all sense of the economic environment. I think in any part of our business we are always cautious about saying just one quarter makes a trend. So, we\u2019ll have to see. I guess I\u2019d say it\u2019s a note of caution for us but I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into it at this point in time.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.\nRick Shane: Craig, actually just asked my question but I\u2019d love to get a little bit more of a specific answer. You defined where the slowdown was in terms of size of the customer but I think what I\u2019m interested in and I suspect Craig was as well, is there any industry that we can specifically look to; I think everybody\u2019s sort of wondering about oil and gas and also any category of spend where you saw it particularly?\nJeff Campbell: Those are good questions, Rick and ones believe me we\u2019ve been asking ourselves. So, maybe I\u2019ll even take this opportunity to step back a little bit. Certainly, we are watching very closely across our global portfolio for any impact to both billings and credit arising from the rather dramatic drop in oil prices. And what I would tell you for now is certainly we see the billings impact to the drop in oil prices; remember it\u2019s 2% to 3% of our billings, so 30% drop costs about 1 point of billings growth. We do see some drop in spend from some of the oil services companies in the grand scheme of our overall billings. However that did not total up to anything that is significant for us. We have not seen any significant deterioration in credit yet either by industry or parts of the U.S. or parts of the globe that are particularly driven by an oil economy but believe me we\u2019re watching all of that like a hawk. It\u2019s also difficult for us to say whether people taking their monies, their savings from slightly lower oil prices and using it to spur more spending elsewhere, that\u2019s tough for us to see. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not happening but not sure we can really see any of it. So to come all the way back to the origin of your question which is what\u2019s driving the sharper sequential decline in corporate card, I think we\u2019ve done enough work to say it doesn\u2019t appear to be isolated to oil service, doesn\u2019t appear to be isolated to any particular industry or geography with any fire point than it is primarily U.S. not in other parts of the world.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash: Good afternoon, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So, I just wanted to ask you one quick question regarding loan growth. You made the comment that you could have some slower growth related to Costco; your growth has been running into the 4%-5% range. Just want to get a sense given the efforts that you\u2019re putting into this from a growth perspective, we\u2019ve seen some across the industry have accelerating growth rates. And I was just wondering, given the focus here, should we expect that we could actually start to see growth rates across the lending area accelerating or do you think the offsets from run-off in Costco are going to overtake the incremental growth that you\u2019re seeing in the rest of portfolio?\nJeff Campbell: Well I think, I might break the answer, Ryan, into three components, so we think about this. Talk a little bit about U.S.; talk a little bit about international; and then separately talk about Costco. Because in the U.S. in fact our loan growth is close to 7% and has been running up at the 6% to 7% rate for the last couple of quarters. And I would say that if you look at the kinds of things that Ed in particular talked about at Investor Day, this is an area where we think we could run that number also little higher than that in the current industry environment without any material change in our risk profile by continuing to build from a marketing perspective, new customers as well as within existing customers, both bringing or borrowing focus customers as well capture more of our preferred share of the borrowing behavior of our existing customers. We are pretty upbeat about that and think it\u2019s a real opportunity for the Company. Internationally, we have a much, much smaller loan portfolio. We do think we can achieve steady growth that\u2019s masked right now by the very significant foreign exchange impacts you see and the fact that and this comes in our third point, there was a loan portfolio associated with Costco Canada. While we didn\u2019t sell the portfolio as you would expect because as I said earlier in response to question because 60% of the spend on it Canadian Costco cobrand using store as that spend run away January 1, you see a more rapid decline in some of the loan balances as well and so that will drag on the international piece a little bit. The third component to think about is Costco in the U.S. So, we can\u2019t be sure of the outcome of any potential sale of the portfolio but that portfolio, if were to be sold, represents 20% of our loan. So, you could accelerate your growth excluding that by significant amount from 7%; it\u2019s still going to take you a long time frankly to get back to even where we are today in terms of the overall loan portfolio and what that means for the spend centricity if you will of our overall income statement. So, long winded answer to your question, but I think you do have to think about loan growth in the context of those three categories. So, I think we have time for one last question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will come from line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. I just want to focus little more on small business and maybe how the lending growth in small business and OptBlue, how that\u2019s tying together. I mean every merchant acquirer talks positively but OptBlue and one of them talk about moving it into Canada. You said Jeff earlier that you\u2019re moving in something similar in related markets. The investor meeting you had you showed the merchant loan portfolio growing from almost nothing to 500 million over the last couple of years. So, how was that tying together? Do you expect to grow the loan portfolio along with OptBlue; is that part of the strategy? And will that be not only in the U.S. but in another markets? And is there any way to quantify in some way the incremental effect that you think that will have on spend growth or loan growth?\nJeff Campbell: Bob, that\u2019s a good question, that\u2019s a series of questions, Bob. And in some way that is the way I would tie together my answer, is to say remember, one of the aspects of our unique close look model is we work extremely hard every day, not just to generate value for our card memories but we work extremely hard every day to see how we generate more value for our merchants. We are very excited about the OptBlue program and we think it is making it easier for smaller merchants to work with us. We think it\u2019s going to expand their business opportunities. And we\u2019re very excited about what it will do for merchant coverage over the next few years. We do lots of things to try to help small businesses operate better. When you look at our open business which on the issuing side, target small businesses, it\u2019s really all about helping drive the success of those businesses and giving them access to spend capacity that our business model and our charge card model really is able to fairly uniquely provide them. And we really try to use that and have used it over the years to drive to a very significant position with small businesses. And we do like small business pattern, another example of what we do to help try value and support for our merchants. Merchant financing in that context is just another extension of the same driver. We have to constantly work at how do we find new ways to add value to merchants, very excited about merchant financing and we think, it is not only a good opportunity for us to in a very thoughtful, measured risk profile centered way grow our financing portfolio , we think it\u2019s a real value add for our partners, particularly some of our smaller business partners. So, hopefully that strategy all fits together; it\u2019s really part of what we have to do every day. So with that I would like to thank you all for joining tonight\u2019s call and participating in the Q&A session. I would summarize by coming back to the fact that we think our results in the first quarter reflect solid core underlying performance. When you think about our Q1 performance and what I said today about Q2 and when you think about it in the context of the multiyear financial outlook that we reviewed at Investor Day, we think we\u2019re on track and we\u2019re continuing to do the right things to position the Company for the long term. So, with that I wish all of you a good evening. And I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Rick, who is going to provide a brief overview of the investor conferences we plan to participate in during the second quarter. Rick?\nRick Petrino: Thanks Jeff. So, yes, before we close, I just want to mention that we are speaking at a number of conferences this quarter. First, our CEO, Ken Chenault will be participating in the Bernstein Strategic Decision\u2019s Conference in New York on May 28; then the President of our Global Network and International Card Services Business, Doug Buckminster will be at the William Blair Growth Conference in Chicago on June 9th; and then on June 10th, American Express President, Ed Gilligan will be at the Morgan Stanley Financial Conference here in New York. Live audio webcast of each of these events will be made available to the general public through the American Express Investor Relations website at ir.amerianexpress.com. Thanks again for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.\nOperator: That does conclude the conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard. Please go ahead.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Ryan and thanks everybody for joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures maybe found in the fourth quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to both the quarter and the full year\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. I am happy to be here to discuss our results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016 as well as our outlook for 2017. As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, our earnings per share, was $0.88 for the fourth quarter and $5.65 for the full year 2016. When excluding restructuring charges, consistent with how we provided our 2016 outlook, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.91 for the quarter and $5.93 for the full year. This performance is significantly above the $5.40 to $5.70 earnings per share range we provided at the beginning of 2016 and is consistent with improvised full year 2016 outlook we discussed last quarter. We are pleased that our business and financial performance enabled us to lift our earnings expectations over the course of 2016 while at the same time allowing us to substantially increase our spending on growth initiatives, particularly during the fourth quarter, to take advantage of the opportunities that we saw in the marketplace. Stepping back to provide some context for today\u2019s call, a year ago in January 2016 on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, Ken and I discussed a number of challenges that our business was facing and provided detailed financial expectations for 2016 and 2017. We also outlined our plans to take significant actions to change the trajectory of the business going forward. All of these actions fell under the three overarching priorities that we outlined at Investor Day of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. 12 months later, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2016 and we ended the year in a stronger position than we started it. Adjusted revenue growth in Q4 was encouraging. We completed in 2016 a record level of business building investments that will better position us for many years and we are running ahead of schedule on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base. We are now halfway through the 2-year period of financial expectations that we laid out at the beginning of last year. Our better-than-expected 2016 performance trends have built momentum that we are seeing across our business entering 2017. As a result, we feel good about our outlook for 2017 for earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.80. That said there is still a lot of work to do. It remains a challenging economic competitive and regulatory environment and so we are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place. Now, let\u2019s turn to the results. Let\u2019s start with a review of our full year financial performance metrics on Slide 2. The full year metrics, of course, were impacted by the end of the Costco relationship in June as well as the large portfolio sale gain during the second quarter. These and other impacts produced the unevenness in our quarterly results during 2016 that we have been discussing all year. As a result, I will provide some adjusted performance metrics for both the full year and fourth quarter to help you better understand the underlying business trends. For your reference, we have included a summary of the adjusted metrics on Slide 20 in the appendix. You may want to pullout and look at as I go through my remarks. During 2016, we generated $32.1 billion of revenue, which was down 2% year-over-year, but increased by 5% when adjusting for FX and Costco-related revenues in the prior year. Our full year performance drove net income of $5.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.65. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS after excluding the $0.28 of full year restructuring charges was $5.93, which was within the higher revised outlook range we have provided last quarter. We continue to leverage our strong capital position to return in 2016 a total of over $5.6 billion of capital to shareholders through buybacks and our dividend, which we again increased this year in the third quarter. The share repurchase drove a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. These results brought our year end 2016 reported return on equity to 26%. Turning specifically to our Q4 results on Slide 3, revenues decreased by 4%, reflecting the decline in volumes and card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2, but excluding FX and the Costco-related revenues in the prior year, adjusted revenue growth was 6% during the fourth quarter. Net income was down 8% versus the prior year and earnings per share was $0.88 or $0.91 when excluding the $50 million of restructuring charges related to our ongoing cost initiatives during the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, our Q4 earnings were down as expected versus the prior year quarter primarily due to a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and we also incurred some smaller discrete items within operating expenses, which I will discuss in further detail later in my remarks. Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 7. Worldwide FX-adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 4. As we have done the last three quarters, we also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes in all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on Slide 5. By this measure, the FX-adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was consistent with last quarter. Our billings performance this quarter reflects a number of trends. In the GCS segment in the U.S., we continued to see healthy performance across our middle-market and small business portfolios and adjusted growth rates improved sequentially in both segments. In contrast, spending by large corporations remained weak with billings declining year-over-year as we have seen in recent quarters. I would say that it is too early to know if any of the changes in corporate and consumer sentiment that have occurred since the U.S. election will impact corporate volume trends going forward. Our U.S. consumer billings performance this quarter was fairly consistent with Q3 and reflected our focus on building long-term relationships with customers, which generates sustainable revenue and profitability. Turning to GNS, we did see a deceleration of billings growth during the quarter as FX-adjusted growth declined from 10% in Q3 to 4% in Q4. The change was due in part to a decline in FX-adjusted volume growth in China. The volumes were still up in China nearly 20% versus the prior year. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks earn on spending within China today. We also continue to see lower GNS volumes in the U.S. through to the end of the Fidelity relationship earlier this year. Finally, turning to international, you see on Slide 7 that our billings growth rate remains strong in both GCS and in our consumer business as we saw our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in FX adjusted terms. This performance reflects an accelerating FX adjusted growth in the UK, which was up 17% versus the prior year and in Mexico, which was up 14% despite the up-tick in the volatility of the currency exchange market since the election with the U.S. dollar strengthening significantly against the Mexican peso. Turning now to our worldwide lending performance on Slide 8, our total loans were up 13% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on the side of the slide, which is relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We continued to grow U.S. loans faster than the industry while maintaining industry leading credit quality and continue to see opportunities to steadily increase our share of our customers\u2019 borrowing. Turning to the right side of the slide, our net interest yield was 40 basis points higher than the prior quarter \u2013 or excuse me, than the prior year and it\u2019s been higher than Q3. As I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s earning call, over the 2 years as our co-brand loans have declined, we have shifted our loan mix towards non-co-brand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances. This change, along with other mix considerations and some pricing actions are driving the higher yield versus last year. Our credit performance and volume growth during the quarter resulted in total provision of $625 million, which was 9% higher than the prior year, as you can see on the left side of Slide 9. As in recent quarters, this growth rate was impacted by the provision in Q4 \u201815 including costs related to the two co-brand portfolios that were sold in the first half of 2016. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year, as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 20% versus the prior year. Similar to last quarter, provision growth deferred significantly between lending and charge. On an adjusted basis, lending provision increased 29% versus the prior year, driven by growth in loan balances and as expected, a slight increase in the lending delinquency and net write-off rates versus the prior year due to the seasonings of new loans vestiges. I would note that lending net write-off rate was down slightly versus the prior quarter and remains best-in-class amongst large peer issuers. Moving to charge card, charge provision was up only 3% versus the prior year as growth in receivables was partially offset by improved credit performance in the current year. Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I emphasize that there has been no change in our credit outlook and the credit continues to perform better than the Investor Day expectations we laid out last March. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect some modest gradual upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members, which will cause provision to grow faster than loans going forward. Turning to our revenue performance on Slide 10, FX adjusted revenues were down 3% while excluding Costco related revenues, they were up 6%, a modest sequential acceleration from 5% in Q3. Moving to the detailed components of revenue on Slide 11, discount revenue was down 4% due to lower volumes, but increased by 6% on an adjusted basis due primarily to the 7% growth in adjusted volumes I discussed previously, along with the discount rate performance I will discuss in a minute on the next slide. Net card fees grew by 6% versus the prior year, due primarily to continued strong growth in our U.S. Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios. I would note that the slower growth in card fees sequentially was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollars during the current quarter. Growth in net card fees on an FX adjusted basis was relatively consistent with Q3. The steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of the value propositions we have in the marketplace and our ability to attract and retain fee paying customers even in the face of an intense competitive environment. Net interest income was down 9% due to lower average loans, but increased 12% on an adjusted basis, driven by the 13% growth in adjusted loans and the higher net interest yield that I mentioned previously. These impacts were partially offset by higher funding costs for charge card due to an increase in interest rates versus the prior year. Now given the recent changes in forward interest rate expectations, I realize there is a lot of focus on the potential impact of rising interest rates. As you are all aware, due primarily to our charge card portfolio, we are liability sensitive. In our most recent annual report, we disclosed that an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would reduce our net interest income by approximately $200 million annually. I would point out though that the math behind this sensitivity assumes a beta of one relative to changes in the Fed funds rate for all of our deposits, including our $30 billion in high yield savings accounts. While future changes in these deposit rates will be dependent upon many factors, the interest rate on high yield savings accounts in fact has remained fairly consistent during the past year despite the increases in the Fed funds rate. Coming back to discount revenue performance on Slide 12, our reported discount rate increased by 2 basis points versus the prior year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchant negotiations, including those types of new regulations in Europe, changes in industry and regional mix and the continued growth of OptBlue. The ratio of discount revenue to billed business declined by 2 basis points year-over-year this quarter as the increase in the reported discount rate was offset in part by growth in contra revenue items including cash rebate rewards and corporate card incentives. We are now lapping some of the upfront incentives we were offering new acquisitions in 2015, which are also treated as contra revenues. This lapping helps to drive a smaller year-over-year decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business than in prior quarters. Overall on revenue growth, we are encouraged by the progress we have made against the four key pillars we laid out at Investor Day last year though there is more work to do and we expect to see some continued unevenness in our revenue growth during 2017. First, our growth trends are strengthening in small business and middle market as we bring together and focus on our sales and marketing efforts targeted at this segment. Second, we are making steady progress on accelerating merchant coverage, particularly in the U.S. and our fourth quarter Shop Small promotion was an early step in raising card member awareness. Third, we have for several years now been steadily growing our share of U.S. lending and we continue to grow well above the industry every quarter in 2016. And last, we are seeing organizational synergies from creating our global consumer commercial and merchant groups as they better leverage best practices from around the globe. Turning now to total expenses on Slide 13, our expenses were lower than last year, both for the full year and the quarter. For today\u2019s call, I am going to focus on the individual expense line items, which I believe will be more helpful in understanding our underlying performance. Clearly, marketing and promotion was up significantly year-over-year and I will cover that on the next slide. Rewards expense was lower in both the full year and for the quarter versus last year, primarily due to co-brand volumes that came off the network earlier this year. Focusing on the fourth quarter trend and adjusting for Costco co-brand volumes in the prior year, rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 13% while adjusted proprietary billings in the quarter grew by 5%. We highlighted the shift in trend on the third quarter earnings call given the introduction of higher rewards on our consumer and small business platinum cards in October, and we expect this relationship to continue into 2017. I would also note that we view the enhanced benefits as important component of our initiatives to drive revenue growth. Moving to cost of card members services, we saw full year growth in this expense line of 11%. We are seeing higher levels of engagement in many of our premium services such as airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta. As we look ahead to 2017, we will continue to invest through this line as we expand the differentiated features and benefits we offer to our card members. We view this as another important component of our initiatives to drive revenue growth. Operating expenses for the full year and quarter include a number of unusual items, a few of which I will touch on in a minute. But overall, we are making progress faster than we had anticipated a year ago in our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion. This is part of what allowed us in 2016 to invest in higher levels than we had originally planned and it will continue to provide momentum for us in 2017. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter though, operating expenses were down 13% versus the prior year. I would remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2015 we took a $419 million pre-tax impairment and restructuring charge and that this year we incurred $50 million of restructuring charges in the quarter. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were down 3% for the quarter, continuing the momentum we saw in Q3. I would also point out that there were some discrete impacts in Q4 \u201816 operating expenses, including a negative impact due to the unexpected change in certain benchmark interest rates, driven by the volatility of the financial markets since the election. But the key theme on operating expenses is that we continue to expect ongoing operating expense benefits in 2017. Finally, as we expected, our tax rate for the quarter was lower than the full year average of 33%. We recognized some discrete tax benefits in the quarter related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax items in the U.S. As we look forward, we would expect the tax rate for 2017 to be more in line with our Q3 year-to-date average of 33% to 34%. Moving to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 14, as expected, marketing costs in Q4 were up significantly versus both the prior year and the third quarter. For the full year, marketing and promotion costs were $3.7 billion, which was 17% higher than the prior year as we invested across a range of growth initiatives that we have been working on for some time. First, we provided increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S. As we discussed last quarter, we rolled out expanded benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business platinum products during October. While it is still very early days, the initial performance trends on both products have been encouraging. Second, we leveraged our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday in the U.S. to build upon the success that we have had increasing our small merchant coverage in the U.S. through OptBlue. Our fourth quarter promotional campaign helped make card members aware of the many new locations where American Express is now welcomed. Third, we leveraged our digital marketing capabilities to build upon the success of our U.S. and international card acquisition efforts. During the quarter, we acquired 1.6 million cards across our U.S. issuing businesses and $2.4 million on a worldwide basis, which remains above our historical average levels and demonstrates that we have now effectively replaced Costco as a distribution channel with our own proprietary activities. Fourth, our investment mix this quarter reflects the shift towards initiatives focused on driving loyalty and building our relationships with existing card members, which is part of the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day earlier this year. And last, we supported all of these efforts through an increased brand advertising presence around the globe. Stepping back, we have been focused now since 2014 on navigating the evolving competitive regulatory and economic landscape. When we made the decision to step away from Costco in early 2015, we told you that we were embarking on a series of steps to reposition the company to be stronger without that relationship. Since then, we have made many changes, including investing in a range of growth initiatives across all of our businesses. In many ways, our marketing efforts in 2016 and particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016 represented the culmination of those efforts. We also remind you that these efforts, including our fourth quarter initiatives, have been targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term. In addition, I would remind you that many of the investments that we made to drive growth, including things like the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products and other differentiated services we provide to card members like lounge access are reflected in our P&L and expense lines outside of marketing and promotion. I would also note that as part of our efficiency efforts, certain marketing activities that were previously provided by external partners will be performed in-house going forward, which will move these costs from the marketing and promotion line to the operating expense line going forward. So, as we enter 2017, we are capitalizing on the momentum, capabilities, customer base and efficiencies that our efforts have produced. The combination of all of these things is what we believe will allow us to moderate somewhat our marketing and promotional spend in 2017 while still continuing to generate solid revenue growth. Turning now to Slide 15 and touching briefly on capital. We again used our strong balance sheet position to return significant capital to shareholders. We bought back $1 billion worth of shares in the quarter and again saw our share count drop by 7% versus the prior year. For the full year, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Our capital ratios continue to be strong. Although it did decline sequentially, which is in line with the seasonal pattern we typically see at the end of the year. We remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital while maintaining strong ratios. Before I conclude, let me go back now to where I started my remarks. On our earnings call last January, we provided our financial expectations for 2016 and 2017. And as you recall, we have said that we expected to earn at least $5.60 in 2017. Based on our business performance over the past year, our outlook for 2017 is for EPS to be in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. This outlook is based on what we know today about the economic, regulatory and tax environment and incorporates the current forward interest rate curve and recent changes in foreign exchange rates. We have not factored into our outlook any additional significant changes in these areas. To state the obvious, there is uncertainty about potential changes in the external environment. We will, of course, discuss any specific changes should they arise and help you understand any potential impact on our 2017 outlook. We do believe that our 2017 plans appropriately balance shorter term profitability with the steps we need to take to position the company for the longer term and in particular, our steady growth in 2018 and beyond. To provide a bit more detail around our 2017 outlook, I would remind you that in our Investor Day last year in March, we laid out one potential scenario for how we could achieve our 2017 EPS outlook, which included a 5% adjusted revenue CAGR across the 2016 to 2017 period as well as significant reductions in operating expense and marketing versus our 2015 base year. As I reflect on that scenario today with the benefit of the full year 2016 results, I would make a few comments. We continue to believe today that a 5% compound annual growth rate and adjusted revenue growth across the entirety of 2016 to 2017 is consistent with the EPS outlook we have provided. We do expect some unevenness in our 2017 quarterly revenue growth rates with lower growth in Q1, in particular, driven by the impact of leap year and some timing factors. To be clear though, we remain strongly focused on driving revenue growth to a rate above 5% and are focused on executing the strategies we have in place to do so. On the expense side, we continue to make faster progress than we initially expected on reducing operating expenses. And as I said last quarter, we now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. This favorability in operating expenses provides us flexibility to spend more on marketing and promotion and we now expect to have modestly higher levels of marketing spend than in our Investor Day scenario, while the ultimate level will be dependent upon our financial performance and the opportunities present in the marketplace. Last, in part due to the acceleration of benefits from cost savings during 2017, we again expect quarterly earnings performance to be uneven with earnings notably lowest during the first quarter, in part due to the revenue impact I just mentioned. We anticipate that earnings levels will increase across the year. In summary, we are encouraged by our performance during 2016, which was a year of transition for the company. We executed well on the strategies we communicated early last year and our results validate that we are on the right path. There is of course, more work to do and we are intensely focused on executing in 2017 and achieving the targets we have discussed today. We will provide further details on 2017 and our long-term strategies at our Investor Day scheduled for March 8 and we hope to see many of you there. With that, let me turn it back over to Toby.\nToby Willard: Thanks Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit your self to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Ryan, back to you.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Yes. Jeff, it sounds like you are kind of maintaining that adjusted 5% top line growth in your guidance, can you talk a little bit about the components, I mean specifically on the reported discount rate what is your outlook there and why not sort of build in off with Q4, a slightly better top line outlook?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. Good question, Don and thank you. To be clear, we are giving very specific EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80. And of course, one of the things that I think we have demonstrated over the years is the flexibility of our business model and the many levers we have to pull to achieve a particular financial performance. What I said in my remarks was that if you go back to the Investor Day scenario, which has a 5% compound annual growth rate for \u201816 and \u201817, we are certainly comfortable that you can get to the EPS range we provided with that kind of revenue performance. I would point out that the adjusted number for us in 2016 was about 5.3%. To be clear, that\u2019s not our goal. It\u2019s not guidance. But even if you assume no acceleration in the revenue growth rate on an annual basis in 2017 with the cost reduction efforts that we already have in place, with the several years we have spent working on different ways to be more targeted, more focused and more efficient in some of our marketing efforts, we are very comfortable that even in fact revenue performance were to come to fruition, we are very comfortable with the earning guidance. So we will have to see how things play out. Over the course of 2014, our loan growth has been very steady, very consistent and very strong relative to the industry for several years now and we would expect that to continue to be a real source of growth. Our volume growth has been steady and we see some signs of pick-up in certain segments, like the small business and middle market area and that will help us. And when it comes to discount rate, at this point, we don\u2019t really have an update to what Anre Williams back at our Investor Day provided for 2017.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you, Don.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, Jeff. I wanted to ask sort of follow-up on the last question or your answer to it. On the small business side, just when you look at the monthly data you have, it looks like your small business loans are growing at 20% annual rate, I guess I am curious if that\u2019s sustainable or do you see anything on the horizon that might slow that growth rate for small business loans?\nJeff Campbell: So I think it\u2019s a good question, Chris. And I think it\u2019s probably fair to say that a lot of our discussions going back to Investor Day and many other forums, we particularly probably talked more about the fact that we are under-penetrated with our consumer card members in terms of capturing what we would regard as our fair share of the borrowing behaviors. That exact same phenomenon exists though with our small business customers. And of course, we have a tremendously strong franchise with small businesses across the globe and in the U.S. We have some unique features to our business model and our capabilities because of our charge card capability that allow us to be particularly effective in helping our customers meet some of their spending needs. But just like in consumer, we have not necessarily traditionally been as focused on capturing our fair share of their borrowing behaviors and so we have been making the same pivot in small business that you have seen us making in consumer and we have steadily been increasing growth rates. A lot of that just like in consumer is driven by our consisting customers. And we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow well above the market there and to maintain really strong credit quality. The one other mechanical point I would make that applies to both consumer and small business is in Q4, a modest piece of the growth is still helped from the fact that we have done better than we had anticipated at retaining some of the former Costco co-brand card member spend and lend behaviors. And if you think about the way we do the adjusted revenues, the adjusted billings and the adjusted loans, that effect helps us a little bit in Q4 and that was actually moderating to be flat with billings and loans to peak of that affect. But that will cause some modest slowing as we get into 2017, but it should remain, we believe, for a very long time well above the industry.\nChris Donat: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. Jeff, I understand that when you make some of the investments you made, you do with an eye towards both near-term, intermediate-term and long-term benefits, but you had kind of a record quarter in terms of M&P and we only saw kind of \u2013 we didn\u2019t really see billings growth accelerate sequentially and take adjusted revenue is only at malls, so can you kind of help us think about how you anticipate those benefits coming through over time through things like Shop Small to take you to kind of a reasonable payoff where we see some acceleration in revenue growth?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. So it\u2019s a good question, Mark. I think of Q4 \u2013 and you are correct, it wasn\u2019t kind of a record. It was a record high level of M&P spend as reflective of the culmination of things we have actually been working on for a number of years and they happen to come together in Q4. So we run Shop Small in the U.S. every fourth quarter. It\u2019s been a tremendously effective event for us for our small merchants. And when you think about leveraging that to begin what we have set for a long time will be the long process of getting customer perceptions about our growing merchant coverage in the U.S. to match the actual coverage, we saw a tremendous opportunity to build upon Small Business Saturday and tried to drive our card members to new small merchants. That just happened to come in Q4. We have for quite some time been thinking about the next steps to evolve our platinum products in the U.S. I would remind you, we tend to make some changes to them every year or 2 years. Those plans have long been in the works. They happen to come to fruition in the fourth quarter as well. The fourth quarter in many ways was the last quarter as I think about it in the U.S. consumer market of some of the battle going on for the spending and lending behaviors of the former Costco co-brand card members. So all of those things came together in a way that just happened to coincide with the fact that we also were performing financially well ahead where we thought we would perform and well ahead of where we have committed to our shareholders that we would perform in 2016, so those are the things that allowed us to spend at the record levels. Now, when you think about all of those efforts, they are all about driving long-term relationships with our customers and generating sustainable revenue and profitability. Most of them have very little in quarter impact. And in fact, particularly on the revenue side, when you think about the new card member acquisition efforts, those are things that we long said often take into years two and three to begin to pay off on the revenue and profit side. So we feel comfortable with the decisions we made. We wouldn\u2019t have expected them to have much impact on Q4 metrics or results. But we think they are the right mix of things to drive the company\u2019s results over the next several years. As you know, when we make investments decisions, we make them considering very long-term economics because this is a business where our customer relationships are sticky. Our best customers are people who stay with us and have been with us for many years and that\u2019s really where all of our efforts are targeted at.\nMark DeVries: Got it. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Bruce: Thanks. Good evening. We have noticed a pickup in travel related activity and spending and I am wondering I know you mentioned in your comments around the large corporate that you thought it was too early to talk about confidence levels and it impacting business volumes, but I am wondering if in particular in that segment, if you have seen any increase in activity levels, maybe more broadly and if you could help us understand what the impact of that would be not only on the billings number, but also on the discount rate, that would be very helpful? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: So the tough thing Ken, as if you think about a lot of the changes in sentiment and a lot of the comments that people across the travel business have made in the last couple of weeks, most of them are forward-looking about the sentiment that they are hearing from the customers about the bookings they are seeing for future travel. They are not necessarily things we would have expected to see in the brief six weeks or seven weeks post election in the U.S. appeared where you have got both the Thanksgiving holiday and the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holidays. So our results through December 31, it is hard to see a noticeable up-tick in large corporate travel spend. There is some modest up-tick and if you dig through the tables in our press release, you will see a modest sequential up-tick in airline spend. I just think we don\u2019t have an update and it\u2019s too early to call it a trend. So we are certainly hopeful that a lot of the other commentary from other players in the travel industry about forward bookings is correct. I just can\u2019t really point to anything in our Q4 results that would suggest in that time period through December 31, there is any meaningful up-tick for us.\nKen Bruce: And any commentary on the discount rates that, that segment has relative to your broader business?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, sorry. Ken, I should have got into that part of your question. As you know, our business over the years has become less and less T&E focused. If you look again back in the tables, you will see this quarter\u2019s number for the percent based in the U.S. of T&E, which someone is looking up here for me. I know it was 24%. Now, that number has steadily gone down and our T&E merchants tend \u2013 there is lots of exceptions, but tend to have higher discount rates than our non-T&E merchants. So one of the reasons why we had said for years that there is a little downward pressure each year on our average discount rate is that because the non-T&E sector is growing faster that mix shift, which is ongoing puts a little downward pressure on the discount rates. So certainly, should the commentary those who say there is going to be a significant up-tick in travel and particularly corporate travel be correct, that would be helpful to our discount rate, I just can\u2019t say that I see anything yet.\nKen Bruce: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. You mentioned about taking a runway to growth, sometimes 2 years to 3 years for new card member acquisitions, I was wondering if you could talk about the engagement of the new card members, how that\u2019s tracking relative to your expectations and whether or not there could be a boost in revenue accelerations related to that growth that you had over the past year?\nJeff Campbell: So we really rigorously track each vintage year is the term we would use internally of new card members we acquire and we study their behaviors and how it tracks over time and think about how that relates to past vintages. And I would say that while there are really modest changes in the average pattern of how quickly we can engage customers and how their spending plays out over time, the changes are kind of slow when they evolve. You tend not to see across large numbers of customers dramatic shifts in behavior. And of course as a company, we are really focused in trying to acquire new card members with whom we can build a long-term relationship where we can really generate sustainable revenue and profitability. So when I look at the card members who we have brought into the franchise over the past 18 months, all of our experience and data thus far tells us they look not terribly dissimilar to people we have brought in, in the past. The one clear difference, which I did talk about a little bit in my earlier remarks, is that while in the U.S. consumer and small business area, the Costco used to be a significant acquisition channel. We have now replaced all the volume we used to acquire through that channel with other proprietary channels, putting people on other products. That particular shift tends to result in customers who have a little higher propensity to carry revolving balance. That does drive revenue a little bit more quickly, tends to drive a little higher yield, comes with slightly higher credit costs as well, but very, very good economics. But other than that general shift, I wouldn\u2019t really call out any change in the makeup of the new card members we are acquiring as of today we think would drive a different profile going forward on how they come to be both revenue positive and profitable.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Arren.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Sanjay.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Hey, how are you? So I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the baseline number for 2016, if we were to adjust for some of the one-time items, I appreciate some of the commentary you have given around the revised outlook, but I am just trying to think through the different ways we can get to the 2017 and the baseline 2016 number, would be helpful?\nJeff Campbell: Sanjay I am happy to go into as much detail as you like. But really, as we think about running the business, if you take 2016 and you say you got a big portfolio sale gain in there that doesn\u2019t repeat and you have got six months of a big co-brand relationship that went away. Those two things you pull out. And look, there is lots of other one-time things and some things that surprised us in Q4 like odd movements in interest rates. But those kinds of things to some extent are going to happen every year. So you make those two adjustments to 2016. You will get when you plug in our guidance range, a pretty darn healthy EPS growth rate between 2016 and 2017, but achieving that growth rate is strictly a matter of sustaining the kind of revenue growth that we have already achieved in 2016 on an adjusted basis. We are trying to raise it, but our guidance doesn\u2019t necessarily count on it. Executing on the $1 billion takeout of infrastructure costs and we thus far are ahead of our plans both in time and dollars to do that. And then moderating our marketing and promotional spend. And we have been pretty specific on the marketing and promotional spend in the past at Investor Day in one scenario I talked about how in 2015, we spent $3.1 billion of marketing and promotion and at the time, I said we probably pulled that down by $200 million or $400 million. Last quarter, I said with the better progress we are making on OpEx, we probably don\u2019t need to pull marketing and promotion down quite that much. And I would also remind you, I was trying to make this point in my earlier remarks that there is many things we do to drive revenue growth. And we have made very conscious decisions for example, that putting financial resources towards improving the value proposition in the Platinum product for both consumers and small businesses in the U.S. is an even more effective use of our financial resources in 2017 than putting that same amount of money towards marketing and promotion. We have clearly done more to provide very differentiated services to our card members. And our lounge network is an example of something that we can uniquely do because of our scale. That runs through the cost of card member services line, not through marketing and promotion. But we are doing more of that now than we were a year ago. And I think you can expect to see us do more a year from now than we are today. And that\u2019s another example of why we are comfortable that we can moderate down the marketing and promotion line, because part of what we are doing is just shifting to other kinds of spending that we think will be even more effective in driving the end goal, which is more revenue growth. So that\u2019s how we think about it. If you just take again the revenue growth rates we are already yet, the cost reduction plan that\u2019s well underway a little bit of moderation in M&P. And then of course, the continued steady returns of capital that we have a long track record of doing and we just completed a year where we returned about 99% of our net income to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase, that\u2019s the simple model that makes us comfortable with the outlook that we provided.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Sanjay.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Hi, I apologize if this has already been asked. But I was hoping you could comment on \u2013 provide some more detail on what you are seeing in the competitive environment, you have seen some interesting moves from Chase recently as they seemingly have pulled back on the promotional offering on the Sapphire Reserve card to fund an increase in the rewards on the Amazon cards, so one might deduce they reached the point of maximum pain, you also could see rising interest rates along with worsening credit, which might lessen the appetite for secondary players to drive easy Cashback programs, so do you see the window improving over the next 1 year or 2 years in relation to competitors?\nJeff Campbell: Well, good question and comments, Craig. Look, we tried to be extremely mindful of all the things going on in the marketplace. However, we are even more mindful of what we are doing to provide the best possible value propositions for our card members, our merchants while still generating real sustainable growth for our shareholders. I think the events of the last couple of years say to us that in the U.S. and I would remind everyone on this call that your question is probably mainly targeted at the U.S. consumer market, which is really the market where we are seeing a real evolution of the competitive environment over the last years, less so in our other markets, less so in B2B, less so outside the U.S., etcetera. I think our experience over the last few years makes us cautious about making any business decision that relies on our competitors deciding to pull back on any benefits or relies on an assumption that the marketplace is going to be any less competitive than it is today and in fact it may become even more so. But even in the face of all that competition, we feel really good about our value propositions, right. We have been growing card fee revenue in the high single-digits all year as driven by fees out of our Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios, the exact premium cardholders and our competition has been targeting at. So we are mindful of all the changes in the marketplace that you went through. Certainly, from a credit and interest rate perspective, we always make long-term decisions based on a through the cycle perspective. And certainly, our history of managing through difficult credit situations is a pretty good one where we tend to come out more quickly and more strongly than others, stay more profitable than others and in fact some like that\u2019s been a good opportunity for us to pick up a little bit of share. But we will have to see. So we have a very clear set of financial expectations we have laid out for you, all of our shareholders and for ourselves. We feel good about our progress midway in. we are very focused no matter what happens in the competitive environment on achieving the results we have laid out.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: And our next question comes in the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good afternoon Jeff. Maybe I can ask a question around rewards, I fully understand that this is baked into your full year guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, but can you maybe just help us understand, particularly as you are enhancing some products how we should \u2013 and the competitive arm that you just talked about in Craig\u2019s question, how can we think about the relationship between billings growth and reward growth, I mean I think you said earlier something like 5% billings and 13% reward costs, do you think we are going to see that type of magnitude for the better part of 2017 or could we start to see some of that growth alleviated?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. It\u2019s a good question, Ryan. To remind everyone, if we go back to the beginning of 2016 when at Investor Day I laid out a couple of different scenarios for growth, at that point, we built into those scenarios an assumption that our awards costs would grow a little bit faster than billings and that was just an acknowledgment of the competitive the environment that in many ways Craig Maurer just did a nice job of laying out. Now, in fact when you look at most of 2016, we have not seen rewards costs growing any faster than billings until Q4 and so that should tell you pretty clearly that what drove that change in trend was the introduction of the different benefits to both the consumer and small business platinum cards in the U.S. With that being what drove it, I think you should expect to see numbers somewhat in the ballpark and what you saw in Q4 and you are correct, on an adjusted basis, I talked about 13 \u2013 I am looking for the number here, but we talked about billings growth of 5 and rewards growth of 13. So you should expect to see something in that ballpark through the first three quarters of 2017 just from actions we have already taken. Beyond that action, we will have to see in the competitive environment, we are always looking to periodically refresh products. When we do that though our goal is to try to refresh them in a way that provides enhanced and differentiated benefits to our card members and frankly often as a result, allows us to capture a little bit more economics from the product. So our goal going forward would be to continue that trend. We also feel good about a lot of our value propositions. Our Cashback products in the U.S. have been tremendous acquisition vehicles for us with the value propositions they have. Our co-brand products we think are extremely competitive in the marketplace. And around the globe, you operate outside the U.S. in an environment where we think we have market meeting value propositions in most of the places in which we do business. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily look to see the trend increase from what you saw in Q4. I do think you should expect to get three quarters of it in 2017. And I think you should see \u2013 look to see us build upon the differentiated service and value propositions we can put into the marketplace.\nRyan Nash: Great. Thank you for the detail answer.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJason Harbes: Hi Jeff, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So just looking at the charge card receivables that accelerated quite nicely this quarter, I believe it was a 5-year high, to what extent do you view that as a function of some of the Platinum enhancements you put in place this quarter and more generally, how sustainable do you view that sustainment along with the double-digit loan growth that you have demonstrated over the past year? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks for the questions. Jason I think, there is really two questions probably there. From a charge card perspective, look, the charge card franchise is a tremendously strong and unique asset that we have and it cuts across both our commercial and consumer segments, of course. I think it\u2019s probably a little early to say that a couple of months into our introduction on just one product, the Platinum product of new benefits that it had a material role in what you would have seen the quarter end. I think what you saw at the quarter end is really a function of trends across the entire charge card franchise, which is both consumer, commercial and is impacted by lots of things. And certainly, the fact that we were able to achieve that growth while also, in fact seeing improved credit quality in the charge card franchise, because as you recall when I talked about provision, I had pointed out that charge provision was actually up less than charge growth because of improving credit quality. So gosh, we feel really good about the franchise. We see continued growth. The Platinum product in the U.S. is an important component of that franchise. And while it\u2019s too early to declare victory, we do feel good about the early returns. On lending, we are now several years into growing our lending, which is predominantly in the U.S., well above industry rates. And yet several years of doing that really doesn\u2019t even put a dent in the under-representation that we have in our customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. And that\u2019s why we feel very comfortable that we have a long runway of continuing to grow above the market, both consumer and small business lending, as we just continually capture a little higher share of our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. So I really would say we feel good about both of those trends and the charge business as well as with loans. Thank you for the question Jason.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Rick.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my questions today. When I think about develop sort of a simple engagement, I think about three components, the sign-up bonus, which basically encourages people to take the card, the ongoing rewards, which is sort of had an inn place decline in terms of engagement and then brand, which has the long-term decay in terms of engagement and I think even your competition will agree that the brand is really your advantage, when you do the analysis of when your customers are taking away or engaged by competitors through either sign-up bonus or rewards and then those rewards abate, do you have any analysis that shows how they return because of the strength of the brand?\nJeff Campbell: That\u2019s a really good question, Rick. I \u2013 let me make a few comments. Certainly, we think the brand is a tremendous asset for us. But I think you have to think a little bit more broadly about what it is that causes our card members to \u2013 and this is my word, really attach to American Express in a way that I think is unusual. And my experience with other brands and certainly other card brands and part of its brand, a large portion of it is service and there is a 160-year-plus legacy of our company being all about service, all about going the extra mile for customers when something goes wrong. It\u2019s about the scale we have, which allows us to offer some differentiated benefits and services that others find very difficult to match, right. And then I am going to come back to something I talked about earlier, which is the lounge \u2013 the breadth of the lounge access that we offer to people who hold our premium products would give them lounge access. It\u2019s very difficult for anyone who doesn\u2019t have our scale to ever match. And the combination of our own centurion lounges, which have been tremendously powerful in terms of strengthening the brand with the lounge access that we get through our great partnership with Delta and then the other lounge networks that we give our members access to, which are probably easier for others to replicate, but not those first two. That breadth that our scale allows us to do things with the levels of service, the long, long reputation for service, that global scale, the brand, those are the things that as we sit around and think about products and product features that we start and those are the things that we think hardest about how we strengthen the unique aspects of them so that we can do things that our competitors won\u2019t be able to match. Now you are right, customers, particularly a subset of customers are going to think about sign-on bonuses and they are going to think a lot about mathematical calculations about rewards and we need to be responsive to that. But our view and I think our history and our performance, which say we don\u2019t need to match necessarily because we have a brand reputation and an ability to deliver service and differentiated benefits that others can\u2019t match. So the trick is what\u2019s our goal is producing long-term customer relationships, which are going to give sustainable revenues and profits for our shareholders as well. And all of our thinking is always targeted and trying to achieve the balance that gets at all of those things. So, thank you for the question Rick.\nRick Shane: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ho: Hey, good evening Jeff. I just want to circle back on your views on potentially how much of leverage your guidance could have in an environment where you do have an inflection and kind of the organic component of spend you spend for account or a little bit of acceleration inflation, obviously there historically have been very beneficial to your model, but obviously you shifted away a little bit more from the higher \u2013 highest spend to like the more mass affluent maybe middle market, but just want to get your thoughts there on kind of \u2013 any kind of coil spring effect from the better macro environment?\nJeff Campbell: Well, certainly, for some number of years now, we have been operating in a slow growth and really no inflation environment. And occasionally, they would do remind people, as you were just reminding us all, that low or no-inflation environment when you have a spend centric model is more challenging in some ways in terms of achieving some of the historical levels of revenue growth we typically are achieving. So more than anything else, what is good for us are the same things that are good for everyone in the economy, which is more robust growth than we have seen, a little bit of inflation, I think \u2013 I would probably say we are pretty neutral on. We do have to be sensitive to our liability sensitive balance sheet. Although as I tried to talk about in my remarks, while we are more liability sensitive than others, we do have a portion of our funding structure that probably has some lower beta than one rising interest rate environment. So we will have to see. There is so much uncertainty I think economically right now, what our tax policy is going to be, what\u2019s going to happen to growth in some of the foreign markets we serve, what\u2019s going to happen to foreign exchange rates. I guess I just summarized by saying what we are after is steadily, healthily growing economies and stable exchange rates, but we will adapt to whatever environment we face.\nToby Willard: Ryan, we have got time one more question.\nOperator: Okay. And that question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning \u2013 good afternoon sorry, it\u2019s evening over here. Question on how we think about the dynamics in the charge card as you are migrating some of those people to be more on a revolving basis and it\u2019s an opportunity that you are offering to them and certain part of it, I am just thinking how you think through that dynamic on the balance sheet?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I guess I had make a couple of comments. I think Betsy you are getting at it sounds like you understand something that maybe not everyone outside the company always does, which is sometimes I think there is a perception that you got charge card customers, they have zero interest in borrowing money from anyone. And what in fact is the case, both on the consumer and small business side is we have learned over the years that some of our best charge card customers are off carrying balances on our competitors\u2019 products, and that\u2019s why we would become a little bit more focused on from a product perspective and marketing perspective and targeting perspective trying to in fact capture our share of our customers\u2019, including our charge card customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors and we have a number of ways to do that, including other lend-oriented products in hands of charge card customers or we also have \u2013 and not everyone realizes this \u2013 an ability for our customers to borrow on their charge cards with a product we call Lending on Charge. So we actually see that expansion, both on the small business side and the consumer side as a way to strengthen both our charge card and the borrowing relationship we have with the existing customer. It\u2019s a way to grow our lending with customers who we know incredibly well from a credit quality perspective. And it has a side benefit in a rising interest rate environment, I suppose, slightly lessening our liability sensitivity as an overall company, although that is certainly not a driver of the strategy. It\u2019s a bit of an offshoot from the real strategy, which is how do we strengthen and build even broader better relationship with some of our best customers who tend to be the charge card customers. So thank you for the question, Betsy. Toby, maybe I will turn it back to you.\nToby Willard: Great. Thanks everybody, for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest. As Jeff mentioned earlier that our Investor Day is coming up on March 8 and we hope to see many of you there.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Toby Willard, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Ryan. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures maybe found in the third quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, our earnings per share for the third quarter came in at $1.20, which is 3% below the prior year. These results reflect our continued focus on our priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and substantially reducing our costs. There is clearly still a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with our performance through the third quarter and our results have come in above the expectations that we shared with you earlier this year. The favorability was driven by faster than anticipated progress on our expense initiatives and steady credit performance. Also as we have discussed previously, we did take a very balanced approach to our second half assumptions given some of the dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace, including the portfolio sale last quarter in the overall competitive environment. While the environment continues to evolve, we now have greater clarity after seeing the consistent growth in adjusted billings, loans and revenue that we experienced in the third quarter. Also as expected, Q3 included a higher level of investment spending than the prior year and certain impacts from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, including a modest restructuring charge. And finally, we continued to use our capital strength to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. Separate from our operating results, this quarter also saw the recent Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in our favor in the Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. Though I would point out that the DOJ has the right to further appeal the decision. The progress we have made this year gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively into Q4 with a number of initiatives that we have been working on for some time. These include a renewed emphasis on our Platinum Card portfolios in the U.S., which provide a combination of service, access and benefits that have been the benchmark of value for more than 30 years. They also include our biggest campaign yet to build on the success of Small Business Saturday and drive additional spending at neighborhood businesses in a way that leverages the ongoing expansion of our merchant network in the U.S. through our OptBlue program. In addition, we are going to continue to build upon the digital marketing capabilities that help to bring on a record number of new card members this year with expanded acquisition campaigns, both in the U.S. and key international markets. Finally, we will be supporting all of these initiatives with an extensive advertising campaign. With these and other initiatives coming together at the start of the peak shopping season, it will be a very active fourth quarter. In support of this, we are planning a substantial increase in our investment spending to bring together and leverage the combined impact of all these initiatives on our card members and merchants during the remainder of the year and to position us for growth in the years ahead. A highlight that the decision to increase investment levels is consistent with how we have run the company for many years as we seek to leverage earnings capacity to invest for the moderate to long term. Turning now to the summary of our financial results on Slide 2 the revenues decreased by 5% reflecting the decline in volumes in card member loans following the portfolio sale in Q2. I would note that FX had a relatively small impact on our reported results this quarter, the first such quarter in quite some time. Net income was down 10% versus the prior year due primarily to the lower revenues combined with a higher level of investment spending. These impacts were offset in part by lower rewards and operating expenses. We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 72 million shares which has driven a 7% reduction in our average share count. This decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove EPS of $1.20 for the quarter, which was just 3% below the prior year. These results include a restructuring charge of $44 million this quarter related to our cost reduction efforts. Since we have provided a 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our adjusted EPS, after excluding the $0.04 restructuring charge, was $1.24 in the third quarter and $5.01 on a year-to-date basis. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended September 30 to 26%. Moving now to our billed business performance trends, which you see several views of on Slides 3 through 6. Worldwide FX adjusted billings were down 3% during the quarter as you can see on Slide 3. As we have done the last two quarters, we have also provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rates excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on Slide 4. By this measure, FX adjusted billings growth was 7%, which was down from 8% last quarter. We saw a number of positive trends within our underlying billings performance during the third quarter. Within the GCS segment, performance amongst both the U.S. and international middle market and small businesses remains healthy. Our international consumer billings growth rates remained strong, which I will come back to in a minute. In the U.S. consumer segment, while the ultimate outcome will play out over time, you are on track with our expectation to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale, which does provide some lift to our adjusted billings growth rates, but we are starting to lap it this quitter. We are also on track with the overall performance trends we had expected across the evolving and competitive U.S. consumer space, in particular, seeing strong growth across our U.S. Cashback products. Our adjusted billings performance this quarter also reflected several challenges, which enacted our year-over-year growth rates. The largest driver of the sequential decline in the growth rate versus the second quarter was the end of our network relationship with Fidelity, which moved to a new network this quarter. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from Fidelity was minimal as we were not the card issuer. U.S. billings growth was also impacted by lower gas and airline ticket prices, which remained headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. And finally, consistent with prior quarters, spending by large corporations remains weak with billings declining year-over-year, reflecting the slow growth revenue environment and cost reduction efforts being undertaken by many large companies. Coming back to the drivers of total international billings performance on Slide 6, the increase in FX adjusted billings growth to 11% during the current quarter was driven by improved performance in JAPA, primarily due to an up-tick in growth rates in China. As you know, while China does impact our billings growth rates, it has a very small impact on our revenue and earnings due to the low margin that all networks are in on spending within the industry. Within the EMEA region, our UK business continues to perform very well with FX adjusted growth of 16% during the third quarter. The weakening of the British pound that has occurred since the Brexit vote at the end of June has been a drag on our reported billings and revenues. But from an earnings perspective, as you recall, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the UK serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Turning now to loan performance on Slide 7, our loans on a GAAP basis were down 12% compared to Q3 \u201815, reflecting the sales of the two co-brand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide, we have excluded the sold co-brand portfolios from the prior year and adjusted for FX. On this basis, adjusted worldwide loan growth of 12%, which is down from 13% in the second quarter, but continues to outpace the industry. We continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high quality prospects. Over the last 2 years, as our co-brand loans have declined, we have successfully shifted our mix towards non-co-brand card members. These card members are more likely to revolve their balances, producing good returns for us, but they do have a slightly higher write-off rate. We do not believe that this mix change is driving any significant change to our overall credit profile and it is producing good returns. Our net interest yield during the quarter was 9.8%, which was up from recent quarters. Several factors influenced this change. The sold co-brand loan had a slightly lower average yield than the rest of our tenured portfolio. In contrast, the non-co-brand card member launch to which our mix has shifted have a higher yield. In addition, some of the new card members from last year have begun to lap their introductory EPR periods. These positives were then partially offset by a small increase in the percentage of loans in introductory promotional periods due to our strong acquisitions over the past year. Turning to provision on Slide 8, total provision decreased by 5%, as you can see on the left side of the slide, but this result includes provision in Q3 \u201815 related to the two co-brand portfolios that were sold earlier this year. When you exclude those credit costs from the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased 6% versus the prior year. This 6% however, is a combination of two different trends. Charge card provision declined year-over-year due to improved credit performance as both worldwide write-off and delinquency rates were below prior year with the write-off rate in our U.S. consumer business reaching a new historical low. Consistent with prior quarter performance, adjusted lending provision increased by more than the growth rate loans. As expected, we are beginning to see some seasoning of our newer loan vintages. Turning to our reported lending credit metrics, I would point out that they are impacted by the Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. As a reminder, these loans primarily relate to canceled accounts. They are having an impact on our reported write-off rates this quarter, but no provision impact as they were already reserved for at a higher level. Excluding these loans, adjusted write-off rates are relatively consistent with last quarter and remain best in class among peer issuers. Stepping back from the quarterly credit results, I would emphasize there has been no change in our credit outlook and the credit continues to perform better than our Investor Day expectations. Consistent with our previous comments, we expect the continued growth in adjusted loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members will both contribute to an increase in adjusted provisions going forward. Turning now to revenue performance on Slide 9, reported revenues were down 5% while adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly from 4% in Q2 to 5% this quarter. This level of growth is consistent with our year-to-date adjusted revenue growth performance and the expectations we shared at our Investor Day in March. As we look at the detailed components of revenue on Slide 10, we see a decline in discount revenue from lower volumes, while on an adjusted basis, discount revenue increased by 5%. This was driven by the 7% increase in adjusted volumes that I already discussed for the quarter, offset partially by a decline in the ratio of discount revenue to billed business, which I will come back to in a few minutes. Net card fee growth continues to be strong, up 10% this quarter. We are seeing healthy growth in our domestic Platinum, Gold and Delta portfolios as well as in key international markets like Japan and Mexico. Steady growth in card fees is a reminder of the strength of our value propositions and our ability to attract and retain fee paying customers even in the phase of an intense competitive environment. Moving on, net interest income was down 11% on lower reported loans while up 10% on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, adjusted loans were up 12% and net interest yield on card member loans increased year-over-year. These impacts were partially offset in net interest income by higher funding costs related to our charge card portfolio due to the increase in interest rates versus last year. Last, I would point out that net interest income represents 17% of our total revenues this quarter, somewhat lower than we have seen in recent quarters, given the sales of the co-brand portfolios. Coming back now to discount rate performance on Slide 11, we saw the reported discount rate increase 1 basis point year-over-year as lower discount rate volume coming off the network more than offset the rate pressure from merchants\u2019 negotiations, including those tied to new regulations in Europe and the continued growth of OptBlue. We did see the ratio of discount revenue to billed business moved down by 5 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year decline stems in part from the continued growth from Cashback rewards. The greater sequential change in Q3 versus the reported discount rate is due to our billings mix shifting towards GNS or network business in Q3 as co-brand volumes declined. Turning now to expense performance on Slide 12, you can see the total expenses were down 3% compared to the prior year. I will speak specifically about marketing shortly, so let me start by focusing on rewards. Reported rewards expense declined 11% versus the prior year, much more than the 3% decline in reported billings I mentioned earlier. We first noted this variance in Q2 as the billings from co-brand products that formerly drove rewards expense come off the network and are partially replaced with new volumes that are more likely to earn Cashback rewards, which are recorded as contra discount revenue. Excluding volumes and rewards in the Costco co-brand in the prior year and including the cost of rewards on Cashback products, the growth in adjusted rewards was relatively in line with the growth in adjusted proprietary billings this quarter. Looking forward, however and consistent with our Investor Day expectations, we would expect this trend to change and for rewards, including Cashback, to grow faster than billings as we continue to enhance our product value propositions over time beginning in the fourth quarter due to the recent enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products. Turning then to operating expenses, we continue to feel good about the progress we have made to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. We have made faster progress than we had anticipated on identifying and executing the key initiatives behind this effort. In the third quarter, this translated into operating expenses being down 3% year-over-year despite the $44 million restructuring charge that we took in the quarter. Moving now to marketing and promotion expenses on Slide 13, I would remind you that as we entered 2016, we anticipated that our full year marketing spending will be similar to prior year levels of $3.1 billion. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we highlighted that we anticipated full year marketing expenses would be at least $200 million higher than 2015 as we take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. Consistent with these comments from last quarter, marketing and promotion was up 10% versus the prior year in Q3. As we have discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of our investment-focused areas and we did acquire 1.7 million new cards across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 2.5 million on a worldwide basis. This performance remains above our historical average level of acquisitions, though as expected, it is below the levels in recent quarters. Looking ahead to Q4, the financial performance we have had year-to-date gives us confidence to move ahead more aggressively with the series of initiatives that we have been working on for some time. In particular, we plan to accelerate and leverage the combined progress we have made in several areas. First, providing increased marketing support for the tremendous Platinum card franchise that we have in the U.S., we are excited about the changes announced earlier this month, which will provide expanded travel benefits for our U.S. consumer and small business Platinum products. These new benefits are just one step in a series of further enhancements that we plan to make to the Platinum product over the course of the next year. Second, leveraging our many years of sponsoring Small Business Saturday to build upon the success that we have had increasing awareness among small business merchants and card members. Small Business Saturday is a great example of how our closed loop enables us to partner and provide value to both our small business merchants and our existing card member base. We have made significant progress growing our small merchant footprint in the U.S. through OptBlue and believe that a fourth quarter promotional campaign represents an excellent opportunity to make our card members aware of the millions of new locations where American Express is now welcomed. Third, further building on the success of our U.S. card acquisitions across all of our products, including the distinct opportunities present in the consumer cards segment. Fourth, increasing our acquisition efforts in key international markets to build upon the positive momentum seen in our international business. And last, supporting all of these efforts through an increased brand advertising presence around the globe to drive greater penetration and share of mind with both consumers and merchants. We believe that the fourth quarter provides an opportunity to bring together and leverage the combined impact from all of these initiatives to best position the company for growth in 2017 and many years beyond. As a result, we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during Q4 will be significantly higher sequentially and that for the full year, M&P will be more than 10% above 2015 close. Moving now to capital, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned 92% of the capital we have generated to shareholders, which has driven a 7% reduction in our average shares outstanding. While we will, of course, be subject to the annual CCAR process going forward, we remain confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios. So, let me now conclude by going back to the key themes in our results and providing an update on our outlook for the balance of the year. During the third quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate revenue growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remain focused on our cost reduction efforts and continued to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders. To put the third quarter into the context of our full year plan, as a reminder, the beginning of the year, our outlook was for full year 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, excluding restructuring charges and other contingencies. We also pointed out that consistent with our history we expected to use a portion of the portfolio sale gains to fund the increased spending on a range of growth initiatives across the company. We also said that we expected to use the gains to fund spending throughout the year, which would result in some unevenness in our quarterly results. On last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we updated our outlook and said that we expected full year 2016 EPS to be at the high end of the $5.40 to $5.70 range. We also said that the competitive dynamics within the U.S. consumer space created a bit more uncertainty around our second half assumptions. Today, while competition remains very intense and the environment will continue to evolve, we have greater clarity about the trends we are seeing due to our actual results this quarter. This clarity combined with continued favorable trends in credit and operating expense performance offset partially by the increases in marketing and promotion and rewards that I discussed what would have allowed us to raise our full year 2016 EPS guidance to be between $5.90 and $6. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies. Turning to 2017, our outlook for full year EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged at this time. Given the faster than expected progress on our cost reduction initiatives, we do now anticipate that operating expenses in 2017 will be lower next year than the $10.9 billion shown in our Investor Day scenario. Depending upon our operating performance and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace, we believe that the accelerated operating expense savings we are achieving could provide us with the flexibility to have higher levels of marketing and promotion next year than in our Investor Day scenario while still tracking towards our $1 billion cost reduction target as well as our earnings target for 2017 of at least $5.60. We continue to believe we have the right strategy in place to meet our objectives in 2017 and to build a solid base for driving longer term growth. We are pleased that our results so far this year have provided us with the flexibility to bring together marketing efforts in the fourth quarter around the host of initiatives I outlined earlier, while also raising our outlook for full year earnings. We are clearly operating in a challenging environment, but are intensely focused on executing the plans we have in place.\nToby Willard: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Ryan?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Limiting it to one question, if we do see a rise in interest rates, do you expect there to be any change in the competitive environment as it would seem low credit combined \u2013 advantageous credit combined with low rates has allowed what you could call some second rate players to simply throw cash at the problem in the form of Cashback rewards?\nJeff Campbell: Well, Craig, I guess a few comments. We run the company and try to make our decisions based on a very long-term view of how we build long-term sustainable value for our shareholders by creating long-term relationships with our card members and merchants. Frankly, when we do that, we take it through the cycle view of the economics as we make decisions about what we can get good investment returns on and what we can\u2019t. And so that leaves us believing that we should be aggressively investing where we see opportunities regardless of where we may be in the cycle. It is a competitive environment right now. But what I would say is that in response to that competitive environment, we try to stay very focused on our longer term goals and on creating the kinds of products, value propositions and offerings to our card members and merchants that bring to us people interested in the same kind of long-term sustainable value and relationships that we are after. Now, what is the rising interest rate environment as mean for that, well, certainly for us, I think everyone would recall that given the significance of our charge card franchise, for us all else being equal, rising interest rates are \u2013 cost us a little bit of money. 100 basis points all else being equal is a couple hundred of million dollars. On the other hand, rising interest rates, in theory, should be accompanied by reasonably good economic conditions and that generally provide some kind of offset. So we feel very comfortable that we have in place a range of strategies and tactics that will drive and be economically sustainable through whatever economic environment we face with these rising interest rates. What that might mean for the competitive environment, we will have to see, but we try not to make decisions counting on any particular change in the competitive environment.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go to the line now of David Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Ho: Good afternoon. Just talking about the incremental investment spend, particularly in your Platinum product, was this \u2013 how much of it was reactive versus proactive in response to a new entrant late in October and to what extent will this continue and kind of what\u2019s the pace of investment, we kind of felt a taste of that due to a recent value prop increase, but what else next?\nJeff Campbell: I think it\u2019s a good question, David. What I would say is we are continually working to maintain and keep vibrant what we believe is by far the gold standard in high end cards and that\u2019s the Platinum product, both in the consumer market and the small business market. And you see as part of that us steadily and consistently evolving the product. If you think back over the last few years, every year have seen steady enhancements to the product from the introduction of the Centurion lounges to expansion of various travel oriented credits around TSA PreCheck and Global Entry through status that we are able to offer people through things like our partnership with Hilton HHonors. And so you see a very steady stream of these things. And there is a lot of thought, a lot of planning that goes into them. And what we have announced earlier this month is the latest in that steady stream. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you should expect more, so none of those things happen in response to any particular move by our competitors. They are all very long in the planning, but they all do stem from a general view of how we view the competitive environment evolving in general and how we think we can best evolve the product to take advantage of the broad range of brand and service and global reach that we can bring to our customers that are the kinds of things that we think let us stand out and are very difficult for competitors to match.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And I guess I don\u2019t want to beat the rewards thing to death, because there are so many other things to focus on. But with the Sapphire card and I would imagine that when you put your planning together, that you were aware that you would expect the Costco, Citi would have very aggressive marketing programs, but are you seeing \u2013 have you seen in effect on the cancellation rate or lost cards from these new competitive products and the rewards that you have put in place and the changes that you put in place, do you think that, that\u2019s good enough to slowdown any competitive loss and then possibly lead to American Express starting to gain market share instead of losing market share?\nJeff Campbell: Well, there is a couple of good questions there Bob and let me start by talking about a couple of different product value propositions. When you look at the Platinum franchise, I would point out to you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have seen very nice growth both in numbers of Platinum members in the U.S. as well as the fee income from Platinum members over the course of the past year and that was a contributing factor in our card fees being up 10%. So I would start there and say we feel pretty good about that franchise and its part of why we are continually thinking about how we enhance the proposition in response to the evolving environment. When you look at the Cashback climate, we have been very successful. And again in my prepared remarks, I talked about a particularly good growth we have seen in the U.S. consumer space with our Cashback products. So we feel pretty good about those value propositions. So we will have to \u2013 it\u2019s far too early to see any impact from things that have only been launched in very recent weeks and months. And there is \u2013 I said a few minutes ago, we are in the game for the very long-term to build long-term relationships with our customers. We believe we have product value propositions that are about creating the kind of relationship with our card members that goes on for many, many years. I would point out that when you look at our Platinum franchise, in many ways is built upon a group of people who stay with us for decades, not for short periods of times. So we feel pretty good about all those value propositions. In terms of market share, we have many, many different products across the consumer small business and commercial segments. When you look at the U.S. market in total across all of those segments to remind everyone we found ourselves gaining quite a bit of share in the couple of years right after the financial crisis and ignoring the portfolio sales for just a second. We have had some modest share declines in the last couple of years. First and foremost, we run the company to create value, financial value for our shareholders. We create product value propositions that we think are attractive to our card members and will create long-term value for our shareholders. Certainly as we make decisions, one factor we consider is what\u2019s happening with overall market share. But I would say our number one goal is how we create long-term sustainable financial value, and market share is just one factor that goes into that. So we are not ever happy or content to see ourselves losing a little bit of market share we have lost in the U.S. over the last couple of years. I would point out that outside the U.S., we have been gaining share in almost every market in which we operate. But I would close by saying our number one objective though is making the right decisions to build sustainable financial value.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Jeff, I was wondering if you could help us with the run-rate of expenses as we move into 2017. I know 2016 has a lot of numbers, not a lot of stuff in there, but maybe you could just help us with how to think about the beginning point for 2017 off of which you will have those expense saves? And then secondly, just as far as the rewards costs are concerned, can you just help us think about how to think of the impacts to the rewards rate on the expense line and the discount rate as far as the cash rewards are concerned? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, there is quite a bit there. Sanjay let me take a cut at a few of those. On 2017 expenses broadly, I guess, I maybe break them into three categories: operating expenses and M&P and rewards. So to remind everyone, in March at our Investor Day, we showed one scenario for how you might get to our EPS target for 2017 of earning at least $5.60. In that scenario and we did point out there were other ways to get there as well, but in that scenario, we had operating expense in 2017 of $10.9 billion. And what I am telling you this evening is when we look at the progress we have made in identifying and executing on a range of initiatives, we will do better than that. Just how much better, we will have to see, but we will clearly do better and we feel good about that and we are continuing to work everyday to find more money and get the number as low as we can. The next thing I said in that Investor Day scenario is that versus a 2015 base of M&P of about $3.1 billion, we thought we could trim as much as $200 million to $400 million. We will have to see on that one. I would tell you that certainly to the extent we can do better on OpEx, to the extent we have revenue trends that allow us to achieve our financial bottom line targets, I suspect we will probably not pull down M&P as much as we suggested in that Investor Day scenario both because we may have the financial flexibility enough to do it. And look, I am certainly not going to sit on this call, Sanjay, try to argue with people that the environment doesn\u2019t continue everyday to be a very, very competitive environment. So, our M&P probably comes somewhat off that 2015 level, but perhaps not as much. Rewards is certainly a moving target, because it\u2019s a function both of the new value propositions we put in the marketplace with Platinum as well as the evolving mix across our Cashback cobrand and proprietary portfolios. So on that one, I will tell you, other than the directional comment that beginning with the fourth quarter, you will see a reversal of the trend we have seen the last few quarters where neutral rewards have been growing a little bit more slowly than billings that will clearly reverse in Q4. It should be clear to you we have been planning that for some time. That\u2019s why going back as far as Investor Day, I said built into the 2017 numbers and the scenarios we showed for what might happen beyond, we had assumed that rewards cost will grow faster than billings. But I think, Sanjay, I am probably going to wait one more quarter until we provide a little bit more insight into 2017 to be much more specific than that and the Q4 results I think will help everyone begin to calibrate as well.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. First question on the UK, you see an acceleration there. I think it\u2019s reflecting the same question I asked last quarter, it was 10% I think last quarter FX adjusted, now it\u2019s 16%, lot of competitors sort of reacting to the interchange reductions there. What\u2019s your strategy there? Are you gaining share because you are sort of holding the line of rewards in the face of the interchange reductions? And is there any color you can provide on your outlook for the UK business given that sort of competitive advantage at this point? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I do \u2013 we are pleased by the growth we have seen in the UK, which has been in the double-digits, above 10% for quite some time now. And then I would also point out, as I said earlier, that, that is typical of the majority of countries outside the U.S. where we, in most countries, not all, but in most do find ourselves are gaining share albeit starting from much smaller basis in share than what we have in the U.S. We have a very flexible business model. You hear us talk a lot about the many different advantages of having a closed loop model gives us and we talked a lot about the value that we get from that fact everyday we have to go out and negotiate with merchants to demonstrate our value. And everyday, we have got to demonstrate our value to card members. That is giving us some flexibility in the UK and across Europe to try to craft propositions for both the merchants and card members that people find very attractive as that environment evolves. So, we are pleased with the growth in the UK. I would say that growth has been strong for some time, but it does seem to have picked up even a little bit more steam as you look at this year. So, we are pleased with that and we are working hard all across the EU to further build on that momentum. I would remind everyone however that in the nearer term an offset, which we talk about when we talk about the discount rate is that we are in a multiyear process probably of slowly renegotiating many of our merchant agreements in Europe. And as we renegotiate them because of the caps on interchange, there is more pressure on us in many ways to keep the differential similar, but bring the absolute breakdown and that\u2019s part of what we have been talking about for some time now. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s putting some unusual downward pressure on our discount rate. So, that is an offset that we should remember to some of the nice volume performance we are seeing in Europe.\nChris Brendler: Thanks so much, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the success you have talked about in digital marketing with the 1.7 million accounts you added in the U.S. this quarter and 5.9 million year-to-date. Are you seeing improvements in your cost of acquisition relative to what you have seen in the past and is that a function of being digital or you are just getting better at acquiring customers than maybe were a couple of years ago?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. There is probably a couple of different phenomenon, Chris, worth commenting on. So yes, every quarter, we get better, more sophisticated more thoughtful about how we leverage our closed loop data in terms of making our digital marketing more effective. And that\u2019s why across the globe in our consumer businesses, the majority of our new card member acquisitions for sometime now have come through digital channels. So, one of the reasons why we believe we can moderate marketing and promotional spend over time without losing traction on accelerating revenue growth is every quarter, we get a little better in digital marketing. It is far more economically efficient than some of the other direct mail or depending on what country you are in and the world we used direct sales channels sometimes in a few countries. The one thing I would acknowledge that goes the other way a little bit is certainly our relationship with Costco provided a really good source of acquiring new customers and that was a very low cost acquisition channel and they were good customers attracted to two good brands. So, we have lost that. One of the things internally that we do look at that and are pleased by is as we have lost that channel, we have effectively had to completely replace that acquisition effort with efforts in other channels. Digital has played a big part of that and we feel we have crossed the threshold, if you will, where our acquisitions now even though we have lost that one big former channel, we are above what they were in the prior year and we feel good about that mix. I would say though that certainly not all of our card member acquisitions are digital yet, and one of the positives to me about that is it means I see many years still ahead of us of getting better every year and that\u2019s going to give us a little bit better economics every year. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Jeff, most of my questions were actually asked, but I was just hoping you could kind of discuss the performance of the global merchant services, the growth rate in revenue, you talked about \u2013 you mentioned Fidelity in your comments, but talk a little bit about the revenue growth and margin trends there, if you could?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. I would remind Moshe, you and for everyone, as we re-segmented the company after \u201810, reorganized the company late last year, we created the four new segments. In the new segments, what we call GMS, which is led by Anr\u00e9 Williams represents our merchant and loyalty businesses. That business does not have in it the \u2013 what we call the GMS or network business, which is the business that goes out and negotiates with third-party issues such as the third-party issuer of the Fidelity co-brands. That business is reported in our international consumer segment for the most card part because most of those are relationships are outside the U.S. Fidelity was one of the small number that were in the U.S. So with that as background, when you look at the GMS segment, quite frankly, it\u2019s really going to track the overall company because what you are really seeing in that segment are the acquirer and network economics that go with the issuing done by the consumer in commercial segments. What you see when you look at what we are calling ICNS or the International Consumer and Network Services segment, is the combination of our proprietary issuing businesses outside the U.S. along with the network business. And we do provide in the tables some information about the growth in the network side of the business, which continues as it has for many years now to be of the highest growth in terms of billing segment of the company. So with all that as background, what I would say is the GMS segment really just reflects the overall company economics. And I am not sure I would add a lot there. When you look at the performance of the GMS or network business, we continued to be very pleased by growth in that business outside the U.S. I would say the business in the U.S. is not a growth business. It was down this quarter driven by Fidelity and that would be one thing that I would say is not a particular growth opportunity for the company at least in the near-term. But outside the U.S., we see very nice growth in Europe, Asia as well as Latin America. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKen Bruce: Thank you. Good evening and a surprising quarter in a very good way, so congratulations. My question relates to credit, you talked about competition being intense and most of that\u2019s around rewards. One of the other areas that we have noticed is there has been a lot more focus on growing loans across the board and we are seeing some expansion of the credit box, all things being equal, you guys have been growing fast yourself and you talk about higher loss rates, I guess I would like you to try to dimensionalize kind of where you are expanding the credit box versus what you think is just seasoning within the portfolio without really changing the composition, the overall composition of that loan book. If you could help us with that, that would be great. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: It\u2019s a good question. Okay. I guess I would say a couple of things. As I said in my prepared remarks, what you have seen is that as our co-brand loan portfolio has shrunk due to the portfolio of sales, we have worked very hard to replace the growth that was formerly coming from those co-brand card members with non-co-brand card members. And as a general statement, we find that the non-co-brand card members are more likely to revolve on their balances. They do have higher write-off rates, so the average credit quality is marginally below where it was for the co-brand card members. We price for that. That\u2019s part of why as I went to the net interest yield, our net interest yield sequentially has gone up a little bit because you are losing the lower yielding co-brand card members and you are gaining more non-co-brand card members where the yield tends to be a little bit better. So that\u2019s the one area where I would say there is some evolution in the nature of the card members. You add to that seasoning because you go through a process over the first year or 2 years that you require a revolving card member where they evolve through the credit process. And those are the two things going on that have led us for some time now to say we feel good about our loan growth. We think we can grow loans at the kind of rates we have been growing them for a very long time and we think we can do without materially changing the overall credit profile of the company. Because I would also just remind you the other reason that we have been able to do that for some years now, because remember it\u2019s not \u2013 we didn\u2019t just accelerate our loan growth, it\u2019s been well above the industry for several years now. And you haven\u2019t seen a change in the relative credit profiles. We are able to grow loans probably because we are just focused on it now and we are creating the products that are attractive to consumers in that area. We are creating marketing that actually drives people to the product and could we just have more focus on it here as a management team. And as you heard us say over and over again over the last year, we really were leaving a target rich opportunity for ourselves with our very low penetration into our own card members borrowing behaviors. And so that\u2019s a key difference I think Ken, between us and where others maybe because as we thought a few years ago to begin to accelerate our growth in loans, we really didn\u2019t have to figure out we are already capturing our share of our own card members behaviors. How are you going to attract new card members, we had a very different proposition ahead of us. We could just say well, what do we do to start tuning our marketing and products so that we capture more of our appropriate share of wallet that we already captured on spend. So I think that gives us a very different opportunity set than others may have. And I think it\u2019s an important component of why we had several years of growth above the industry while maintaining our relative credit positioning. So hope that helped.\nKen Bruce: Thank you. Yes, it does. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Jeff, I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about where your thinking is on the international strategy, it sounds like it\u2019s going to be one of the areas of investment that you highlighted, it\u2019s been a pretty strong area where some of the U.S. consumer businesses are feeling intense competition, can you talk a bit about what you are thinking, are you getting more aggressive there, or is this just sort of continuing the pace?\nJeff Campbell: No, I \u2013 it\u2019s a good question Don. And I do think we are trying to drive even more growth out of our international businesses. I will point out for some time now with the one challenge we had and Canada aside, we have seen really nice growth across our international consumer businesses. Our international small business segment, which is reported in GCS is \u2013 has consistently for some time now been our highest growth segment in the company. So we feel really good about the growth we have been getting and we will be doing a number of things to try to accelerate it further. When you say though talk about your international strategy, that\u2019s always a challenging question, because we don\u2019t have an international strategy. We have a strategy in the UK. We have different strategy in Germany where we are greatly able to leverage the tremendous strength of our business, which has really nice synergies. The card business, we have a totally different opportunity in Mexico where we have one of the largest market shares we have outside of the U.S. and a tremendous market position that\u2019s growing rapidly. We have a very different strategy in Japan where due to a relationship we struck with JCB many, many years ago, it is one of the few international markets where we have tremendous coverage. And that has been fueling growth rates in the double-digits for a number of years right now. Sorry, I could go on, but I guess my point is we feel good about the trends that we have seen for a couple of years now. We are trying to provide even more resource and focus to invest in the markets where frankly we see the greatest traction and I just named a couple of them. It might be go on, but I won\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t want to take too much of everyone\u2019s time. And it\u2019s really more about just putting more time, effort, resource and focus behind the things we are already doing.\nDon Fandetti: And just as to quickly clarify I know it\u2019s not material, but the China activity pick up, is that outbound coming out of China, is that sort of just organic growth or are there new signings of deals?\nJeff Campbell: No, it\u2019s really organic growth. And so you do see the growth across all types, including outbound, but the biggest chunk is still intra China, where like all networks our share, we are allotted under the Chinese government\u2019s rules is quite modest, to put it mildly. So we like to thank we have continued to you very successfully build the brand and build presence of China. We have been able to do that without putting any capital into China. And as the Chinese government inevitably moves towards a more open and competitive market, we hope that that brand presence that we have been able to create is an asset that we will be able to leverage more over time in the future.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with American Express [ph]. Please go ahead.\nJames Friedman: Hi. I want to ask Jeff, if you had any observations or comments about your incubation strategy, I remember a couple of years ago you sold your Concur out of your portfolio, I think you probably disclosed Foursquare and [indiscernible] in China, I was wondering are there any assets that you are particularly excited about, I think that you might monetize over time? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: That\u2019s a good question, James. Certainly, we were pleased in the last couple of years, I would say, you saw two in particular really significant investments that turned out quite well for us, the ICBC investment as well as the Concur investment. We do run, as you would find it, many if not most companies of our size and scale, a venture capital group. And we do have very modest investments in a range of companies across the payments and technology spectrum. I would say our goal there is really about making sure we stay very close to where innovation is happening across all of the spaces that are interesting to us. Our goal is to invest with companies where we can also create working relationships and operating relationships where we can help them succeed and we can also stay with the pulse. And our goal is not to necessarily as the first priority find ourselves making lots of money by buying and selling these stakes. That\u2019s not really the goal. And our goal is not to lose money. So from time to time, we have one of those companies that has some \u2013 take some kind of exit and there are modest gains that I don\u2019t usually even bother to talk about are modest losses. For now that\u2019s too quite a nice modest positive. But as I said, that\u2019s not the goal. There is nothing else in the portfolio that I would say is material at this point that an investor should be aware of. There are always investments are quite small.\nJames Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hi, good evening guys. I will try to make this one quick. Jeff, you gave us a lot of detail in terms of the puts and takes on the expense base, whether it\u2019s the below 10.9 and/or the marketing and promotion dollars, can you just \u2013 given all the customer acquisition that you have done this year, can you just help us understand the outlook for revenues, clearly you talked about a lot of different areas, small business, calling back market share, increase lending what you have talked about on this call, but can you give us a sense of how you are progressing relative to expectations on revenues and given this increased marketing spend that you are doing, could \u2013 is there a potential we could see higher than expected revenue growth?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think Ryan, as you would probably expect me to say, we will have to see. We are pleased that when you look at Q3, you saw a little bit of sequential acceleration from the 4% you saw in Q2. We are pleased that year-to-date 35% [ph], I would remind everyone that our scenario that we showed back in March at Investor Day through 2017 had a 5% revenue CAGR, so we are already there. We as a management team, we are laser focused on thinking through the best strategies for accelerating revenue growth further into the kind of higher range scenario that we talked about beyond 2017 at Investor Day. But we will have to see. There is \u2013 we feel very comfortable and confident in the choices we have made, but there is a lot of factors, whether it\u2019s the economy or interest rates that someone brought up earlier or the evolving competitive environment. What I would say is we feel good about the earnings guidance we have given people for 2016 and 2017. We feel good about the revenue trends we have seen year-to-date. We feel good about the decisions we have made and we will see how that all plays out in 2017.\nRyan Nash: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much. Jeff, I was hoping that you might just clarify how we should think about net income for next year? I mean, obviously, you have given the guidance on the EPS and we know that there is going to be significant share repurchases and you have talked to a number of the expense line items. But how do we think about the net income and core profitability relative to, let\u2019s say, an annualized run-rate for the quarter that you just produced?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I would make a few comments. I think you should presume that we will execute upon the CCAR approvals that we have from a share repurchase perspective. And so that math will get you to some continued significant uplift in EPS versus net income. When you think about the quarter we were just in, I would say a couple of things. You would expect to see based on all the comments we have made a little growth in rewards costs relative to the quarter we just saw. On the other hand, we have a lot of operating expense that we are now confident we will get out as we get into 2017. We also believe we can moderate the marketing and promotional line somewhat. I talked a little bit earlier about the tubing and throwing that we will debate internally over the next couple of months about just how much. And then clearly, we are very focused on continuing to get good revenue growth and our goal is to accelerate it. So, you can sort of back into what that will mean depending on what you want to believe about where we end up on an EPS perspective. In some ways, I suppose the probably least variable of all the \u2013 variables I just talked you through would be share repurchase, because you can publicly see what we are going to do. Thanks to the CCAR process. So, that\u2019s probably the way I would think about it, Eric.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much.\nToby Willard: Hey, Ryan, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. That comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I will try to be quick here. Jeff, you had talked a little bit about the distortion that\u2019s occurring is as you increase the mix towards Cashback between member rewards and the impact on net discount revenue. I am curious as we think about the fourth quarter and your emphasis on marketing \u2013 or excuse me, on growing the Platinum book, how we should think about that relationship, because I am assuming that\u2019s not a Cashback offer?\nJeff Campbell: Correct. Yes, so it\u2019s a good question, Rick. So to remind everyone, what I have been trying to do the last few quarters just due to the way the accounting rules work, we put our Cashback rewards up as a contra revenue and our membership rewards and cobrand rewards generally go down is what you see in the rewards line. So, we try to add all those up as they have been growing so much similarly in recent quarters. Rewards have actually been growing a little bit slower than billings. That will clearly change next quarter because of the Platinum changes. There were also in last year\u2019s fourth quarter a couple of true-ups that kind of one-time things you have from time-to-time that helped lower last year\u2019s Q4 rewards line. So the year-over-year change will look a little bit more exaggerated in this Q4 than in others. In some ways, it might be better to look at the sequential run-rates of rewards, Rick, to try to figure out what happens to the rewards line. But that Cashback counter rewards sequentially aren\u2019t going to do anything unusual other than just grow as the products grow. And the two things that will change on the rewards line are the implementation of these Platinum changes, which will clearly drive significant cost. How much? We will have to see what the take up is, etcetera, along with this accounting item that I talked about from last year. So hopefully, that\u2019s a little helpful in how you think about it.\nRick Shane: And the good news is that the clock is now ticking on anniversarying all of these adjustments. So 12 months from now, we won\u2019t be thinking about this quite as much.\nJeff Campbell: I think everyone will enjoy the October 2017 earnings call, Rick, when I don\u2019t have to do adjust at anything. Thank you very much for that reminder.\nRick Shane: You could be happiest guy out there.\nToby Willard: Alright. Thanks, everybody for joining tonight\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. Ryan, I think we are all set.\nOperator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earnings per share for our second quarter was $2.10 and, as expected, included a number of discrete items, creating some complexity in our results. This complexity included a $1.1 billion pre-tax gain for the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio, a continued slowdown in Costco-related volumes leading up to the date of the sale, a $232 million restructuring charge related to our ongoing cost reduction efforts, and an elevated level of investment spending. Looking beyond these discrete items, our underlying results for the second quarter were solid and consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in March for both 2016 and 2017. Excluding the impact from Costco-related volumes and FX, billings and adjusted revenue growth were generally consistent with recent quarters and our Investor Day expectations. On the expense side, provision and rewards were both modestly better than our expectations as write-off rates have remained steady and growth in rewards has been slightly slower than growth in billed business. As expected, marketing and promotion expenses continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending, while operating expenses were also impacted this quarter by the Costco gain and the restructuring charge, underlying expenses remain well controlled. And during the quarter, we continued to use our capital strength to create value for shareholders including repurchasing $1.7 billion of outstanding shares. We also made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage and driving strong momentum across our lending growth initiatives. In addition, we continue to make good progress on the steps needed to reduce our cost base by $1 billion, which drove the $232 million restructuring charge. Beginning now with the summary of our financial results on slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% year-over-year during Q2 and was up 4% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis. Revenues decreased by 1% versus the prior year and increased 1% on an FX adjusted basis. As you know, our agreements with Costco ended on June 19 and we completed the portfolio sale and related transition. Primarily due to the Costco related impacts, we did see a sequential decline in billed business and revenue growth rates versus the first quarter in line with our expectations. Net income was up 37% versus the prior year due primarily to the gain from the Costco portfolio sale, the majority of which held to the bottom line during the second quarter. The gain was offset in part by the restructuring charge and the continuation of the elevated level of spending on growth initiatives that we expect to maintain for all four quarters of 2016. As I mentioned, we repurchased over $1.7 billion of shares during the quarter, which when combined with the $1.1 billion we repurchased in Q1 represents our highest ever level of share buybacks over a two quarter period. This higher level of share repurchases helped drive a 7% reduction in average share count versus the prior year. Our net income for the quarter combined with the decline in average shares outstanding, drove EPS of $2.10, which was 48% higher than the prior year. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS adjusted for the $0.16 restructuring charge was $2.26. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended June 30 to 26%. Moving now to our performance metrics during Q2, starting with billed business on slide 3. Worldwide FX adjusted billings growth slowed sequentially to 4% during the quarter driven by the decline in Costco-related volumes. Similar to last quarter, we've provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate excluding both Costco cobrand volumes at all merchants and non-cobrand volumes at Costco on slide 4. Billings growth adjusted for Costco and FX was consistent with the prior quarter at 8%, though I would remind you that Q1 included an extra day for leap year. To put this metric into context, I would also remind you that a portion of the new cards acquired in recent quarters relates to Costco cobrand card members who have signed up for a new Amex product. Our efforts around this began early last year and continued until the portfolio sale date. Although the ultimate outcome will play out over time, we are pleased with the demand for our products and the success we've had in putting cards into the hands of former Costco cobrand card members while, of course, closely following the terms of our agreements with Citi and Costco. We expect to capture at least 20% \u2013 we expect to capture at least 20% of the out-of-store spending of the former Costco cobrand card members as a result of our acquisition efforts prior to the sale. This spending is helping to provide a lift in the adjusted billings growth rate shown on slide 4 and will create a number of lapping dynamics as we move forward. Stepping back, the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio highlights the continuing evolution of the competitive landscape and why we have been adapting our strategy to meet the needs of our customers and accelerate growth. We plan to continue to aggressively pursue the full range of growth opportunities that we discussed at our Investor Day in March. These efforts cut across all our businesses, customer segments and geographies, including our initiatives to grow lending, our push towards parity coverage in the U.S., our focus on accelerating growth in small business and middle market, continued strong growth outside the U.S., and of course, our efforts to grow our Consumer business in the U.S. where there will be many complex market dynamics in coming quarters. These efforts all have the common goal of helping to accelerate the company's overall revenue growth which is what we as a management team are focused on. Going forward, while we will provide the adjusted billings and revenue performance of the company for the next four quarters, our focus will be on the outcomes of all of these efforts, not just the narrower performance around former Costco cobrand card members. If we turn now to the segment and regional billings performance on slides 5 and 6, clearly Costco had a significant impact on our U.S. results, as well as on the performance of our USCS and GCS segments. Given that impact, I'll highlight a few of the other significant drivers of our billings performance during the quarter rather than reviewing the regions and segments individually. Lower gas and airline ticket prices remain headwinds across our U.S. businesses and had a similar impact to the prior quarter. International volumes continue to be strong with FX adjusted growth of 10% and performance remained relatively consistent across most regions. To turn to EMEA in particular, given the recent Brexit vote, I would remind you that the EMEA region constituted approximately 10% of our worldwide volumes in Q2. Our U.K. business constitutes 3% to 4% of worldwide billings and it has been growing in excess of 10% in recent quarters. We did see a noticeable slowdown in this growth in the first several days immediately after the Brexit vote. But that growth has since rebounded to its prior strong levels. From an FX perspective, we are relatively hedged naturally against the pound as the U.K. serves as the headquarters for many of our international operations. Like all companies with European operations, we are monitoring the situation closely to determine whether we will need to make any modifications to our business practices. At this point, we continue to operate as usual. Turning now to loan performance on slide 7. Our loans on a GAAP basis were down 13% compared to Q2 2015 reflecting the sales of the Costco and JetBlue cobrand portfolios in the first half of this year. To help understand the underlying trends, on the right side of the slide we had excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios from the prior year, and adjusted for FX. Adjusted worldwide loan growth of 13% is slightly higher than the first quarter and continues to outpace the industry. Now similar to my earlier comments on billings, I would point out that a portion of the loan growth in recent quarters comes as a result of our efforts to have former Costco cobrand card members sign up for another Amex product. Taking a step back, we have been pleased by our steady growth in loans for several years now and we continue to see opportunities to increase our share of lending from both existing customers and high quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Turning now to revenue performance on slide 8. Reported revenues were down 1% but grew by 1% after adjusting for changes in FX. FX-adjusted revenue growth reflected increases in underlying billings and loans, offset by declines in Costco volumes and a decrease in the calculated discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount rate performance and the impact from Costco in a few minutes. Turning first, though, to the other drivers of revenue growth in the quarter, we saw a 7% increase in card fees versus the prior year. The growth was again driven in part by strong performance within our platinum, gold and delta portfolios and is a clear indication that our value propositions continue to resonate in the marketplace. Net interest income increased by 2% during the quarter, though growth did slow sequentially versus the first quarter due primarily to the sales of the Costco and JetBlue cobrand portfolios, as well as the continued drop-off in Costco loans prior to the portfolio sale date in June. As we disclosed previously, the JetBlue cobrand portfolio constituted between 1% and 2% of our worldwide loan balances. Looking forward, given all the recent uncertainty around forward interest rate expectations, I'd remind you that unlike most other banks, we benefit from lower interest rates and are negatively impacted by rising rates, due primarily to the presence of our charge card portfolio. To turn back now to the drivers of our discount rate and revenue performance, on slide 9 we are again showing the trends in our reported and calculated discount fees. As expected, discount revenue growth during Q2 was impacted by a larger year-over-year decline in the reported discount rate than in Q1, due to the prior-year merchant rebate accrual benefit. On a year-to-date basis, the reported discount rate is down six basis points versus the prior year, which is at the low end of our six basis point to seven basis point expectation from Investor Day. Similar to last quarter, we are also seeing an impact on the discount rate from the continued expansion of OptBlue and merchant negotiations, including those resulting from the regulatory changes in the EU that went into effect late last year. We do expect to see a much smaller drop in the reported discount rate during the second half of the year due to the end of the Costco relationship. Coming back to the calculated discount rate, it was down 10 basis points versus the prior year during Q2, driven in part by the six basis point drop in the reported discount rate. As a reminder, a calculated rate is also influenced by contra-revenue items including cash rebate rewards, corporate client incentives and cobrand partner payments, as well as by growth in our GNS volumes. Growth in cash rebate rewards continues to make up the majority of the year-over-year change, driven primarily by our strong cash rebate card acquisitions and billings growth in recent quarters. I'll note that while this is driving increased contra-revenues, we are seeing an offset in the rewards expense line, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in my remarks. Moving now to slide 10, we've included our estimate of Costco-related revenues. I'll remind you that there is some judgment involved with this estimate. Based on our analysis, we estimate that Costco-related revenues declined by approximately 32% versus last year during the quarter. Based on this estimate, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, slowed modestly on a sequential basis to 4% in Q2, driven primarily by the prior-year discount rate benefit. On a year-to-date basis, FX-adjusted revenue growth, excluding Costco, has been about 5%, slightly above our exit rate from 2015. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on driving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of the year. Moving now to credit performance on slide 11. Our lending credit metrics have remained relatively stable on a year-to-date basis and remain best-in-class amongst large issuer peers. Overall, our credit performance is slightly better than our expectation at Investor Day that write-off rates would begin to trend up a little bit, given the seasoning of our loan portfolio. I would note that as part of the portfolio sale, we retained approximately $250 million of loan balances from the Costco cobrand portfolio, which related primarily to cancelled accounts. These accounts are not expected to have a significant impact on provision as they are already reserved for at higher levels. But they did increase our delinquency rate by about 10 basis points during Q2 and will impact our reported write off rate over the next two quarters. Turning to Provision on slide 12, total provision decreased by 1% versus Q2 2015 as you can see on the left side of the slide. But this result reflects the impact of the held for sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held for sale portfolios were accounted for through a valuation allowance within operating expenses. When you exclude those credit costs for the prior year as we do on the right side of the slide, adjusted provision increased by 13%, which was relatively consistent with loan growth and our Q1 performance. Consistent with our Investor Day comments, we expect that both continued growth in loans as well as some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new card members, will contribute to an increase in provision going forward. Turning then to expense performance on slide 13. Total expenses decreased by 15% versus the prior year but were impacted by several discrete items. Excluding the Costco portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge in the current quarter, adjusted total expenses increased by 1% versus the prior year and continued to reflect an elevated level of investment spending. Looking at the individual expense line, M&P was up 4% versus the prior year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. As we've discussed, new card acquisitions has been one of the key areas of focus for our investments and we were pleased that these efforts drove 2.1 million new card acquisitions across our U.S. issuing businesses this quarter and 3 million on a worldwide basis. As I mentioned, Costco cobrand card members signing up for new cards has been a key driver of the increased acquisitions in recent quarters. But we do expect acquisitions to slow somewhat during the second half of the year. While we had previously expected our total spending on growth initiatives during full year 2016 to be similar to 2015, we now expect to spend at a somewhat higher level. The increased spending will support a range of initiatives across the company including some of the potential opportunities within the U.S. marketplace that I mentioned earlier. Our ultimate investment level will, of course, be driven by the opportunities that we see in the marketplace but we now anticipate that marketing and promotion expenses during 2016 will be at least $200 million above the 2015 level of $3.1 billion. Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance, rewards expense decreased by 2% versus the prior year despite there being a 2% year-over-year increase in proprietary billings. This trend is being driven by a shift in volumes from products that have their rewards costs classified as an expense item, such as Costco cobrand, to products that have rewards recorded as contra-revenue items, such as cash back. Total rewards costs including cash rebates, were up 1% in the current quarter, which is roughly in line with the growth in proprietary billings. While at the smaller expense line, cost of card member services increased by 16% versus the prior year. This line can be a bit volatile quarter-to-quarter due to timing issues but due to increased usage of some of the card member benefits that we've recently added, including new airport clubs and Airline Fee Credits, I would expect it to be up around 10% for the full year. Operating expenses were down 31% versus the prior year but were impacted by both the portfolio sale gain and the restructuring charge. Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses were flat year-over-year reflecting our strong focus on controlling costs. We feel good about our progress on our effort to reduce our cost base by $1 billion on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As a continuing part of that effort, we do expect to incur some additional restructuring charges in future quarters as we continue to roll out our plans, though I'd expect they will be smaller than what we incurred this quarter. We also anticipate that a portion of our increased investment spending will occur in operating expenses over the balance of 2016. Turning last to capital on slide 14. We continued to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we finished fully utilizing our 2015 CCAR authorization, repurchasing $6.6 billion of shares over the past five quarters, including $1.7 billion in the second quarter. As you recall, our 2015 CCAR submission included a higher level of net income than our actual performance since it assumed that our relationship with Costco would continue. However, given the performance of our underlying business and the benefits from the Costco portfolio sale, we were still able to fully utilize our CCAR 2015 capacity while maintaining our strong capital ratios. We were also pleased with the 2016 CCAR results, which were released last month, as the Federal Reserve did not object to our CCAR 2016 plan to return up to $4.4 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next four quarters. These potential payouts are aligned with our Investor Day expectations and will enable us to provide a steady return of capital to our shareholders. As you are all well aware, CCAR continues to be a very complex process. In general, capital plans are governed by the Fed's model, which can have very different results from a bank's own expectations. For example, in the current year, the Fed assumed that our risk-weighted assets would increase in a severe stress scenario despite the loss of the Costco cobrand portfolio. It was very different from our own projections. I'd also highlight that we have the highest ROE amongst all the bank holding companies that go through the CCAR process. In combination with our high payout ratio, this results in a large reduction in capital levels over the CCAR period in the severely adverse scenario. For example, if we pay out 100% of base case net income, our capital ratios would be reduced by well over 50% in a severe stress scenario. Thinking more broadly, the 2016 CCAR results once again highlighted the strength of our business model and balance sheet as we generated the highest net income amongst all bank holding companies in a severe stress scenario and our capital ratios before the impact of capital actions were also in the top quartile. So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and our outlook for the balance of the year. During the quarter, we made progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, including driving new card acquisitions across our global consumer and commercial portfolios, expanding merchant coverage, driving momentum on our lending growth initiatives. We also remained focused on our cost reduction efforts and continue to leverage our strong capital position to create value for our shareholders. During the past six months, we have said that our full-year 2016 outlook was for adjusted EPS to be between $5.40 and $5.70. We now believe that full-year 2016 EPS will be at the high end of this range as our year-to-date performance has been better than our original expectations, driven largely by the favorability in our credit and expense performance. As a reminder, this outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies. Given that we're only halfway through 2016, our outlook for full-year 2017 EPS to be at least $5.60 remains unchanged. We continue to anticipate that earnings will be lower during the second half of 2016 due to the end of our relationship with Costco and the fact that we now expect to invest at higher levels during 2016 than we did in 2015. As we have discussed several times, there is a bit more uncertainty around our second half 2016 assumptions. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have an updated view on the complex dynamics within the U.S. consumer marketplace as we progress through the balance of the year. And of course, we will update our guidance at the end of the third quarter. We're focused on our plan to accelerate revenue growth, optimize investments, and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Toby, and then we'll take your questions.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Thanks Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the session. Therefore, before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process. With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Cathy?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Go ahead, please.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, Jeff. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 I mean, you had a benefit from the new Amex cards to the former Costco cobrand cardholders? Is a lot of that in the run rate? Or should we see a continued incremental benefit there? And then also, can you elaborate on what you mean by complex dynamics in the U.S. card market in H2?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So I think the point I'm trying to make, Don, is we were pleased by our efforts over the last, really year-and-a-half to put other Amex products into the hands of the former Costco cobrand card members. And that's why we feel comfortable with my statement that we'd expect to track to retaining over 20% of the out-of-store spending of those card members. So I would say that in the run rate for the most part in the second quarter, it continued to build even as we went through the second quarter and should stay in the run rate, subject to the complex dynamics, which I'll come to in a second. And I mentioned that 20% in the context of the disclosure we're making about our billings and revenue, and for that matter, loan growth rates where we pull Costco out of the prior-year base. Some of the growth does come from the efforts and the success we've had at putting other Amex products in the hands of the Costco cobrand card members. Complex dynamics. When you look at the back half of 2016, it's certainly not news to anyone on this call. It's a very competitive environment right now. And you have many changes that are wrought by the switch from Amex to Citi of the Costco cobrand. You have many other competitors who have launched either new marketing efforts or new products that perhaps are targeted at some of the same types of card members. In our case, we have a range of marketing efforts targeted at lots of consumers and lots of different segments of the consumer world in the U.S., including the fact that the former Costco cobrand card members do just drop into our broader prospect pool at this time. You also for us have some complex dynamics around geographies and certain geographies where the Costco cobrand card members, for example, might have been a more significant part of total Amex card holders. So all of those dynamics are complex. And then if you think about the broader external environment, you have tremendous uncertainty around interest rates. I would point out to you, as we thought about this call, originally thought I might want to talk about the potential of lower rates when you think about the last 24 hours, you have the Fed sort of back-talking about higher ratings. We'll have to see. Certainly, all of the election dynamics here in the U.S., and for that matter the dynamics in the UK and the EU, probably create more uncertainty than we're used to. So I could go on. But I think you probably get the point that there's a lot of different changes going on that just make us a little bit cautious, so we've tried to be very balanced in the outlook that we've given you for the back half of 2016 and what that means for 2017, but we'll have to see where things really come out.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.\nElizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi.\nElizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to touch base on the loan growth that you highlight on slide seven. Obviously it's on the ex-Costco basis but increasing accelerating growth rate over the last several quarters. Could you just give us a sense as to key drivers there? And how much of this is new account acquisition versus wallet share increase and other key drivers? And what the kind of trajectory is that you're anticipating? Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'm just making a few notes here Betsy so I don't forget any parts of the question. I think the first thing that's important to think about is, we now for several years have been steadily growing loans at above industry rates and we've done that while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics and without seeing any significant increase in the credit metrics or changes in our overall risk profile. So this is a continuation of a trend. And that loan growth is coming from many different areas. We have a nice loan portfolio that's been growing steadily in our U.S. small business franchise OPEN. We have a range of consumer products targeted at attracting more of our customers' borrowing behavior. And for us, because traditionally and we talked a lot about this at our Investor Day in March, because traditionally over the last probably five years, six years we have probably underinvested in terms of our efforts to attract the borrowing behaviors of our own card members, both consumer and small business, as well as underinvested in terms of targeting prospects, who from a credit perspective, look just like our customers but are a little bit more revolving-centric. As we have turned our efforts more to those kinds of customers, this is not trying to get more lending growth out of our existing customers, or excuse me, out of customers where we were already tapping into our fair share of their lending behaviors. It's really, how do we tune our efforts to just attract an equivalent lending share to what we already have our customers spend share. So all of those efforts are what have led to the very steady performance you've seen. Now I think it is fair to say this quarter and last quarter you're getting a little bit of an incremental boost that will fade in the next couple of quarters as we have moved some of the lending behaviors that were being done on the Costco cobrand cards onto other Amex products. And since you're looking at an adjusted number there where we pulled all the Costco amount out of the base, that increases that 13% by a little bit. That will fade a little bit, but the broader trajectory which we feel is a very thoughtful outcome of several years of steady effort in this area, we think that outcome will continue for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please.\nChristopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to see if we could get a little more quantification around the elevated expenses you expect for the remainder of this year and what they mean for 2017? And I'm asking this because if we look at the implied EPS for the back half of the year, it looks like it's less than a $1 a quarter. And then it seems like it would be a big leap to get from that to, say, a $1.40 a quarter which is what you need to do to do $5.60 a share in 2017. So just on the elevated expense piece, I know there's a lot of other moving pieces there, but can you help us understand what's elevated this year and might drop off next year?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. That's a really good and I think important question, Chris. So couple of comments. The investment piece to start with, as you point out, we have made a decision that, as we look at all of the complex market dynamics, which I just talked about in response to the last question. We're going to increase somewhat in the second half of the year and increase for full year 2016 over 2015 our overall level of investments. Those investments take many forms. Some of them are pure marketing and acquisitioning investments, some of them are technology investments that are about building capabilities in infrastructure. All of them are targeted at a mixture of very short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits. And as we look at our performance in the first half of the year, where we've done a little bit better on expenses and provision than we expected and revenues are tracking as we expected, we felt very comfortable even going to the higher end of our guidance range in increasing the investments a little bit. Our view of 2017, though has changed in that in 2017 our expectation would be that elevated level absolutely falls away and particularly some of the capability building that we're funding here. Our projects very naturally will fall away. The question I get a lot is gee, how can you consider a more significant decrease in this investment level without thinking it's going to impact your revenue growth. Well, part of the reason is, it's the things like I just described where these are projects that we very discreetly decided to fund and they will naturally fall away. The other thing to keep in mind is that we feel we are making very good progress on our efforts to pull $1 billion out of the cost base on a run-rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have said all along, sometimes to get to those ultimate positive outcomes, we actually have to spend some money, right? If you're automating things for a little while you have to spend the money on automation before you can put the automation into place and take the costs out. If you're right-shoring things you often have to have duplicate teams in place for a little while until everything is running smoothly. In the back half of 2016 you have some of those added costs actually working against us. We are very comfortable, though, with the tract and the line of sight we have into 2017 and feel very good about the progress we're making on costs. So that will be a significant benefit in 2017 versus what you will see in the back half of 2016. So those are the components that go into what we mean when we say we're at an elevated level of investments, going to elevate them a little bit more. If that helps you a little bit think about the big moving pieces that help you get in the back half of 2016 to the EPS guidance we have given you for 2017, which as we sit here today I remain very comfortable with.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Next question, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. That will come from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Jeff, maybe just to understand the \u2013 you made several comments about trends but can you just help me think through how I should anticipate billed business growth trends across the three business lines for the back half?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, let me focus on the global consumer versus the global B2B segment. For the most part I would think of GMS, Eric, is just reflecting the tire company. And I think the nuances to think about here and I'll talk about all of these numbers, taking Costco out of the base because it does affect both segments. In the consumer segment, you have had the biggest benefit from the phenomenon I described about the success we've had putting other Amex products into the hands of Costco cobrand card members. As we finish lapping that, you will actually see some just due to that effect alone, modest decline in the U.S. consumer rate. That's something we anticipate and it's consistent with all the plans we've laid out. Going against that, you have the efforts we have across a broad range of products to drive more billings through a range of efforts in the consumer segment. In the B2B segment, you continue as we talked about initially at Investor Day to have the tail of a couple of different segments of the market. We are seeing really nice growth in the small business and middle market area. And in fact, I would expect to see some acceleration in the middle market area in particular as we get into the back half of the year. The wild card is in the largest corporate clients where, as we pointed out at our Investor Day, that is not particularly a growth segment for us. And that continues to be a tough segment. I don't think there's many of the Fortune 500 who are going on calls like we're having right now and talking about growing their T&E budgets. And for us in that large segment, we predominantly still have a T&E franchise. So we'll have to see how all those things play out. And, of course, you have the whole range of external factors that I talked about earlier that are a little harder to handicap. But those are a couple of discrete things that I would watch for.\nEric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks, Jeff. And as I recall, did you disclose that about 80% of the Costco volume was outside the store? Is that figure about right?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So on the Costco cobrand spending, 70% of that spending was outside the store.\nEric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC: 70%.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Correct.\nEric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. Jeff, I wonder if you could kind of come back a little on talking about the things that you're going be doing actively in terms of expenses for 2017. I mean you talked about $1 billion worth of savings kind of run-rated by the end of 2017. But now it sounds like there's going be some amount of spending in 2016 that won't be there. Can you talk a little bit about that? And maybe you talked about those projects, but how you would think about, in terms of, obviously, marketing to the existing Costco customers is probably somewhat easier. You already know who they are and where they live. Like how do you think about marketing in terms of that for 2017?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, kind of two questions there, Moshe. Let me take them maybe in reverse order. On marketing to Costco cobrand card members, I would remind you that we sold the portfolio. And it's very different from our situation in Canada. So we no longer have any access, or for that matter, knowledge from a marketing perspective, of the former Costco cobrand card members unless they happen to have another Amex card. Now, those people drop anonymously into the broader U.S. prospect pool that we constantly, as our competitors are trying to target with attractive offers, attractive products. But we can absolutely not do any direct marketing to those people at this point. On the expense side, the way I think about it is that there's a couple of big components of the expenses. So people costs are the largest single components, and the now $315 million or so of restructuring charges that we've taken will get at a big chunk of the people savings. When you look at those restructuring charges, for the most part, those are for exits that occur over the course of 2016, with the overwhelming majority of them done by the end of 2016. But you don't necessarily really start seeing the savings until 2017. You have other components of costs. So there's a big professional fees component where we think we can get some savings, one of which is in the area of application development where we do a lot of out-source work. Part of the elevated spending or elevated investment spending that we've been talking about is a lot of technological or technology development work that we think is going be really valuable long-term. That's the kind of stuff where we can actually dial it up even as we go through the back half of 2016 and very \u2013 roughly dial it down in 2017. Still you have a variety of other fees, renegotiated contracts, travel, all those kinds of things that constitute the remainder of the $1 billion. So while there are some savings that will begin to creep into the back half of 2017, mostly on the people side, 2016, excuse me. To a great extent, those are offset by some of the other costs I talked about earlier where we sometimes have to spend money to position ourselves to save it in 2017. So the net of all that is I feel very good about the progress we're making on the 2017 target, and we're working real hard to see just how much of it we can get quickly and early in 2017, and we'll obviously need to give you updates on that in future quarters. But I feel really good about the progress.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I'd like to ask a question about the rewards competition, both in the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. seems to be getting more competitive but I don't think Membership Rewards is going through any sort of revamp. It seems like you're sticking with your current strategy and letting customers who are rewards sensitive just to try it, if necessary. But then in the UK, you've had interchange reductions and I think a lot of competitors have pulled back on rewards. I was wondering if you're picking up share in the UK, the 10% growth you mentioned, because of the lack of rewards competition there. Thank you.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Two good questions. Let me take them in reverse, Chris. So the UK, it is true that since the EU interchange regulations came into effect in early December, you have seen a couple of competitors pull back on some rewards, although it's not universal by any stretch of the imagination. What I would say is while that may help us over time, the really good growth rates we're seeing in the UK have actually been there for quite some time and predate any of those changes. So look, we always say that regulation in our industry we think is generally not a good thing, not consumer-friendly and necessarily produce the best outcome, and regulation around interchange will not directly impacting us. It does have an impact that is unbalanced, not a good thing. All that said, it does at times create opportunities and the flexibility of our business model gives us a number of levers to pull to try to take advantage of different environments and different sets of regulation. So we'll have to see over time. We feel good about our value proposition in the UK. We feel really good about the growth rates that we've had for quite some time. And if we could even accelerate those further, that would be a tremendous thing. In terms of the U.S., certainly it's a competitive rewards environment. It has been for quite some time. I would have to say I can't say that we've seen anything in the last 90 days that changes our view of what it would have been 90 days ago. And our broader strategy to compete in that environment, as you point out, Chris, is to have a wide range of value propositions because everybody's different. Everybody has something different they value. And that's why we have cobrand products, we have cash-back products, we have Membership Rewards products, we have fee-based products, we have no fee-based products, et cetera, et cetera. And we think that kind of targeting allows us to deliver the most value to each customer segment in the most efficient way from a shareholder perspective. Now, I would have to say from our perspective, we are constantly innovating and evolving the Membership Rewards program and we absolutely don't accept just as a matter of course at all. We're going to have people trading out of Membership Rewards. We fight for the loyalty and business and try to earn the business of every one of our card members on an ongoing basis. And the breadth of the Membership Rewards program, our ability to integrate it with other merchants and other offers we think allows us to do some really innovative and unparalleled things that are very difficult for others to offer and match. And we think it's part of why we continue to see good growth in our Membership Rewards products. And we're able to do it while still being able to manage the costs in a reasonable way. So...\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks so much, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we'll have Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, just wanted to get your outlook for credit. Specifically, as I look at the net write-off ratio this quarter, it looks like you benefited a little bit from the sale of the Costco portfolio, so, I think, stripping that out, you're closer to 1.8%. Is that a reasonable run rate as we think about the second half? And then just to expand on that, I think at the Investor Day, you said you expected a bit of normalization, probably in the 10-basis-point to 15-basis-point range over the next year or so. Is that still realistic?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I'm actually a little puzzled by the math you're doing, Jason. So on balance the sale of the Costco portfolio didn't have a material impact on our metrics other than the phenomenon I talked about in my prepared remarks where, because we retained a small amount, $250 million, $260 million of the cancelled accounts, and those are heavily reserved, they impacted the delinquency rate by about 10 basis points this quarter. And they'll have a lot of probably similarly sized impact on the write-off rate in the next couple of quarters. Beyond that, what we laid out at our Investor Day was an expectation that you would see just because we're growing loans a lot, there's some seasoning of the portfolio, we expected you would see some modest uptick in write-off rates and then we painted some longer term scenarios where we talked about maybe write-off rates going up 10 basis points, 20 basis points a year. We haven't seen that yet. The legacy parts of our portfolios in most cases continued to actually strengthen. And the loan growth that we've been doing \u2013 we've been doing while still maintaining a very similar credit profile to what we've had for years. So if you look at our new card acquisitions this quarter, the FICO has averaged over 750 as they have for many, many quarters in the past. So there's really not a material change there. So look, I think we all are in the camp of saying credit rates will go up. They have to go up at some point with seasonal lows but we feel pretty good about the trajectory right now.\nJason E. Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Regarding the new loans that you're putting on, the yield was lower overall than what we thought it would be. So could you talk about how aggressively you're using things like deferred interest promotions and perhaps balance transfers to bring that on? And what type of effect that could have on the NIM over the next few years?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, it's a good question, Craig. So a couple things I'd say. As you \u2013 I don't know exactly what calculation you're doing, but it is true that if you look at the competitive environment right now, like others on a lot of our lending products, there is some kind of introductory period, where there is an interest free period. When you suddenly, as you saw this quarter, lop off in effect all of the Costco loans, which were mature loans, not in that intro period, the percentage of the remaining portfolio that is in that introductory period all of a sudden pops up compared to the combined portfolio before. Nothing has actually changed in terms of the dollars. I think you see the proportion change. And so you do see a little bit of that effect this quarter. One of the complex lapping dynamics that I was referring to earlier in my prepared remarks is as we go through the next couple of quarters, the lapping impact of all of some of the offers and the customer behavior around the new Amex cards we've put in the hands of the Costco cobrand card members, well amongst other things cause billings to trend down a little bit because we've had this surge \u2013 adjusted billings to trend down a little bit, we've had this surge as we brought those card members on. It will also, though, have a very positive effect on net interest income and on revenue in a few quarters as we get the majority of those people past those introductory periods. So when you think very long term, what I would say is that the mix, overall mix that we're offering to new and existing card members from an interest rate perspective is not materially changing. This mix effect that I just described we will work through in the next couple quarters as we finish lapping all the effects of the last five or so quarters of some unusual dynamics around Costco. And once you're through all that I wouldn't expect to see a material change from the prior trends.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW Research. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I guess when we look at the relatively strong underlying growth ex-Costco, how much of that is being driven by old accounts versus new? I guess when we think about some of these investments that you're making, you've talked about how it takes time for them to kind of spool to get you the growth you expect. Maybe you could just give us an outline of what today's investments will bring in the future and what the timeline would be based on your experience. Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, that's a good and very complex question, Sanjay, because of course the dynamics are a little different whether you're talking about a consumer lend card, consumer charge card, an open small business card or new corporate card relationships. But let me maybe make just a few comments. Certainly our growth has been helped by the really nice progress we've made in the last five quarters on new card acquisitions. That growth manifests itself today particularly in the billings line, and then as the next couple of quarters roll by that growth will increasingly move from the billings line into the loan balance and net interest income line as balance is billed for those who are revolvers. And it will grow into the revenue line as we lap various introductory incentives, et cetera. That's a general statement. It's part of why we have said for some time, although I guess I haven't repeated it today now when I think about it, that as we get into the last quarter of 2016 in particular, we expect to see some sequential increase in revenue growth rates. And part of the complex lapping dynamics I was talking about earlier is, we may see a little bit of sequential weakening in the billings rate adjusted for Costco but revenue will be going in the other direction as we get into the end of this year for all the reasons that you're asking about. So the other comment I would make is, one of the things that Doug Buckminster in particular talked about at Investor Day is the fact that we have seen some modest share of wallet losses amongst our existing customers. And one of our key initiatives in the Consumer business is around a range of things we're doing to try to change that trend. I feel really good about the things we're doing. What I would say is, it's a little early in the second quarter to say that they're actually having much of a material impact yet. I would say the second quarter is more impacted by what we've been doing around new card acquisitions. What I conclude from that is, though, because I do feel good about those efforts because I think that is something that you will see the fruits of as we get into the coming quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.\nDavid Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you very much. What impact do you expect to see on future merchant discount rates from the recent Appeals Court decision to overturn the merchant interchange litigation settlement between Visa and MasterCard and several million U.S. merchants? And is that factored into your current guidance?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would say we factor into our current guidance everything we know about a wide range of internal and external factors including the legal environment. I would remind you that is a case that we were not a party to. We don't see it as having a direct impact on our pending appellate case with the DOJ, which we are still awaiting a verdict on and we'll have to see where it comes out. And look, we every day have to go out and negotiate with merchants and demonstrate the value we're providing. And we've been doing that for many, many years in the face of all kinds of changes in the environment. In the grand scheme of things, I don't think that particular legal judgment has a significant or material impact on those ongoing negotiations.\nDavid Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Just as a quick follow up. To the extent the default interchange rate is reduced as part of a new settlement, wouldn't you expect that to have an impact on your merchant discount rates going forward?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I'm going be careful because I don't want to get in the middle of trying to opine on someone else's legal settlement. But I think we're always very clear. And Europe is probably the best example, David, that when you have some kind of regulatory or other external intervention that drives down interchange, even though we don't \u2013 we're not involved with interchange \u2013 that generally puts downward pressure on us. As merchants say, well, you need to remain competitive. So Europe being a good example where in most of those markets we have long had a premium, significant premium, to the interchange rates. As interchange rates come down, we tend to keep our premium. But the premium sort of stays the same and we move down as interchange moves down. So anything that results in a sharp downward movement of interchange is generally going to have a tough or a follow-on impact on us.\nDavid Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more granularity on your comments about the discount rate being less of a decline in the second half. I think you talked about it on a reported basis. How does that compare on a calculated basis?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, so the one big change between the first half and the second half is just Costco is no longer a merchant. And so we had a significant chunk, six, seven \u2013 I guess we haven't given the second quarter, we had significant chunk of our volume that was running through a merchant with a much, much, much, much lower than normal discount rate. All of a sudden all that volume goes away, and just the sheer mass of it pops the average discount rate up. That's really the only big change between the first half and the second half. And if you go back to our March Investor Day slides and you look at Anr\u00e9 William's presentation, he has a nice summary slide that lays out the components of that. But that's the one big change.\nArren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Bob Napoli with William Blair Investments. Go ahead, please.\nBob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just on 2017 again, if you could. Obviously, American Express stock is way below its historical valuation. I guess the S&P's at 18 times. Historically you've been around the S&P. Today you're closer to 11 times. And I guess to regain your multiple, I'd be curious if you agree or disagree that American Express had historically you need to deliver 2017 earnings in a quality way and give a good view to growth in 2018. Sounds like you're really confident on the expense side. I was wondering what's your confidence level and what you're expecting on that revenue side into 2017 and how you think of the medium term jumping off into 2018 and onward?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, it's a good question, Bob. We are laser-focused as a management team on getting back to the kind of consistent and fairly simple financial performance and financial model that drove this company for years. We are in an industry and with a business model that should allow us to get very consistent revenue growth. We have a heavily-fixed cost nature, which allows us to get steady operating expense leverage on that, and we're not very capital intensive. So we get a little bit of a capital kicker on top of that. We feel really good, and I think we've very consistently demonstrated that we can make real good progress on running the cost structure of the company more efficiently, and we're very committed to use of the balance sheet. I think it's fair to say that it was a competitive, economic and regulatory environment, what it's been. That is what has been a larger challenge for us, like many, in the industry. Now as investors look at our results right now, there is a lot of complexity because of the evolution we're going through with Costco. And we're trying to sort through that complexity. But that complexity won't completely go away until you get all the way to the back half of 2017, which is why we won't have to do all the various adjustments and try to help people understand the underlying trends. I would point out though that if you look at the first half 2016, you strip away Costco, you're at about 5% revenue growth. That's versus 4% last year. That 5% is benefiting a little bit from the Costco cobrand members who would put other Amex products in the hands of. So that's our jumping off point and what we are very focused on as a management team. What we really try to articulate at our Investor Day in March is our goal. Our belief is we can get that number up. In particular, our target is to get it to the 6% scenario that we showed you at Investor Day. And we have a wide range of initiatives across our consumer business, across our B2B business, in terms of how we're working with merchants. Wide range of initiatives targeted at getting us there. I think what we are working hard to be able to demonstrate to you and to all of our shareholders is that we are getting real traction on those initiatives and you can see it in our results as we get into 2017, because I think we fully appreciate that this is not just about the EPS we put up in 2017, but it's about the way we get that EPS and the momentum it gives us as you go beyond 2017 into 2018. So that's why we have a very simple mantra at the company right now for over 50,000 people. Our priorities are accelerating revenue growth while we reset the cost base, while we be really focused about what we do with our investment dollars. So in many ways, Bob, that's a great last question. And I think we're probably going to stop there.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Yeah, thanks, Cathy. We're going cut it off there.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Do you have any closing remarks?\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Sure.

Please go ahead, sir.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Thanks, Cathy. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2016 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, our first quarter results were consistent with the expectations we've provided just last month at Investor Day. As a reminder, we closed our presentation at Investor Day by highlighting our focus on accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In addition, I made some specific remarks about Q1, including updates on volume trends and several significant quarterly items such as the close of the JetBlue portfolio sale and the modest restructuring charge, all of which came in about as we expected, and all of which I will describe in more detail later in my remarks. Earnings per share was $1.45 during the quarter, which included a $0.05 impact for the restructuring charge, a $127 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the JetBlue co-brand portfolio, higher revenues and elevated investment levels. We did see an increase in FX-adjusted billed business growth from 5% during the fourth quarter to 6% in Q1, but there were a number of items that influenced first quarter performance, including a benefit from leap year and a drop-off in Costco-related billings as we move closer to the end of the relationship. As expected, we also saw a larger-than-usual year-over-year decline in our reported discount rate and the impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. The results also reflected healthy underlying loan growth, excellent credit performance and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders. Stepping back from the quarterly results, we believe that our outlook for fiscal 2016 earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.70, and for full year 2017 earnings per share to be at least $5.60 remains appropriate. This outlook excludes the impact of restructuring charges or other contingencies. As we discussed at Investor Day, we anticipate that relative to Q1, we will see higher earnings per share during Q2 due to the portfolio sale gain, and then lower earnings during the second half of the year as our relationship with Costco ends and we continue to invest at elevated levels. As we discussed first on the Q4 earnings call and then highlighted again at Investor Day, there is a bit more uncertainty around the second half assumptions versus the first half of the year. While we believe that we have taken a balanced approach, we will have a much clearer view of the impact of the end of the Costco relationship as we progress through the year. Before moving on to slide, I did want to highlight several changes to our earnings material this quarter. As we discussed at Investor Day, we have changed our segment reporting to reflect the organizational changes we made late last year. In addition, to help streamline the financial information we release each quarter, we have consolidated the information included what we call the Earnings Supplement into a single set of earnings tables and slides. We believe this will make it easier to digest the information while not reducing the overall level of information we provide. To move now to the slide presentation and begin with a summary of our financial results on slide 2. Billed business increased by 3% during Q1, which is up from 2% growth last quarter. On an FX-adjusted basis, billings growth also accelerated modestly to 6% during the quarter from 5% in Q4. Revenues increased by 2% versus the prior year and continued to be impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, although the drag from FX was somewhat smaller than in prior periods. On an FX-adjusted basis, revenue growth was 4%, which was relatively consistent with our performance in recent periods. Net income was down 6% versus the prior year as higher revenue and the JetBlue portfolio sale gain were more than offset by a higher level of investment spending and the modest restructuring charge. We again leveraged our strong capital position to provide significant returns to shareholders. Over the past 12 months, we have repurchased 69 million shares, which reduced our average share count by 6%. While the absolute dollar amount of share repurchases we did in Q1 was similar to prior periods, the number of shares we bought back was greater given our lower share price. The decline in shares outstanding, along with our net income, drove earnings per share of $1.45 for the quarter, which was 2% below the prior year. Since we have provided our 2016 EPS outlook, excluding restructuring charges, I would point out that our EPS, adjusted for the $0.05 restructuring charge, was $1.50. These results brought our reported ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 to 24%. Let's now go through the components of results, beginning with billed business on slide 3. Overall, worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth increased slightly this quarter to 6%, reflecting a benefit from leap year as well as slightly higher international volume growth. These benefits were partially offset by a larger year-over-year decline in Costco-related volumes in the U.S. as we move closer to the end of the relationship during June. To give you a better sense of the underlying trends in the core business, we provided a trend of adjusted worldwide billed business growth rate, excluding both Costco co-brand volumes at all merchants and non-co-brand volumes in Costco on slide 4. While Costco U.S.-related volumes were growing a bit faster than total company volumes at the end of 2014, they were down 16% versus the prior year in Q1 of 2016, which decreased worldwide FX-adjusted billings growth by more than 200 basis points. So taking this into account, billed business adjusted for both FX and Costco-related volumes, increased by 8% versus the prior year during Q1, which was up from 7% in Q4. Now, a portion of the increased billings growth has been driven by our efforts to capture the spend activity of current Costco co-brand Card Members. The landscape will change once Citi launches its new Costco co-brand card in June, but we will remain focused on the spend and lend activity of these customers as the environment evolves. Turning to slide 5, which shows our billing results by the new reporting segments. As a reminder, our small business results are now included in the Global Commercial Services segment, or GCS, and our Global Network business is now included within our International Consumer and Network Services segment, or ICNS. The decline in Costco U.S.-related volumes that I've just discussed has the most significant impact on the U.S. consumer volume growth rate, but it also impacts small business volumes within GCS. Lower gas and airline ticket prices also remain headwinds for both the GCS and U.S. consumer segments though they had a more modest impact this quarter. We continue, as Steve Squeri discussed at Investor Day, to see differing performance trends within GCS with better growth amongst small and middle-market businesses versus more cautious spending amongst global and large customers. Volume growth remained fastest within the ICNS segment, driven by strong GNS growth and the lapping of the end of our relationship with Costco in Canada. This lapping also drove the sequential improvement in LACC regional volume growth seen on slide 6. Looking at billings performance across the other international regions, volume growth remained strongest in JAPA, where billed business increased by 13% on an FX-adjusted basis versus the prior year. This strong growth was powered by significant year-over-year increases in Japan, as well as China and Korea, though I'd remind you that there is relatively little economic contribution from spending occurring within China and Korea. FX-adjusted EMEA volume growth was relatively consistent versus the prior quarter at 8%. With continued strong performance in the U.K., growth rates remained in the low double digits. Turning to loan performance on slide 7. On the left, you can see that our GAAP total loans were down 14% compared to Q1 2015. This decline reflects the reclassification of the Costco co-brand portfolio to held-for-sale effective December 1 and the sale of the JetBlue portfolio this quarter. To understand the underlying trends, on the right side of slide 7, we have excluded the Costco and JetBlue portfolios and adjusted for FX. This shows a modest sequential acceleration in worldwide loan growth to 11%. And as we disclosed in our regular monthly credit stats 8-K last week, adjusted U.S. Card Member loans were up 12% versus the prior year, which continues to outpace the industry. We've also provided a split of the balances between Card Member loans and other loans at the bottom of slide 7. Today, the majority of other loans relate to our merchant financing products. While it makes up a relatively small percentage of the total, other loans have been growing more quickly recently. As we highlighted at Investor Day last month, we believe that there are attractive opportunities to grow in this space going forward. Stepping back from the quarter's results, we are pleased with the steady acceleration in underlying loan growth we have demonstrated for several years. As you know, the majority of our loans relate to our U.S. card business, where growth has consistently outpaced the industry over the past several years. Industry growth rates have improved in recent years as well, which clearly has also driven a part of our recent acceleration. We continue to believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of lending in both existing customers and high-quality prospects without significantly changing the overall risk profile of the company. Turning now to revenue performance on slide 8. Reported revenues were up 2% and grew by 4% after adjusting for changes in FX. The growth was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a slowdown in Costco related revenues and a larger than usual decline in the reported discount rate. I'll provide some additional details on the drivers of discount revenue performance and the impact from Costco in just a few minutes. First, though, looking at the other revenue drivers in the quarter, net interest income grew by 9%, given our continued strong loan growth. We also saw an uptick in card fees which increased by 5% versus the prior year. This was due primarily to growth in fees from our U.S. Delta, Platinum and Gold portfolios, all of which goes to the strength of these value propositions. To now expand on the drivers of our discount revenue performance, we told you at our Investor Day that we would begin to provide some additional information which you see on slide 9. The top line in the chart shows the trend in our reported discount rate which, to remind you, provides insight to our pricing at point-of-sale with merchants. The bottom line in the chart shows our calculated discount rate which is the rate you would derive if you divided the discount revenue that we report on the P&L by total billed business. This includes the impact of other items such as growth trends in our network business, cash rebate rewards, and incentives we pay to both co-brand partners and to clients. During the first quarter, the reported discount rate declined by five basis points, consistent with Anr\u00e9 Williams' comments at Investor Day about expecting a larger year-over-year change in the discount rate during the first half of this year. In addition to the factors that have traditionally driven declines in our discount rate, such as merchant negotiations and mix changes, we are also seeing an impact from the continued expansion of OptBlue as well as the regulatory changes in the EU that were enacted late last year. As you are aware, expanding merchant coverage is a key priority for us, and we continue to make progress on growing our merchant footprint this quarter. I'd also remind you that while growth in OptBlue does drive a decline in the discount rate, that impact has been more than offset on the bottom line by the benefits from incremental volumes and lower operating expenses from reduced incentive payments to merchant acquirers. Looking forward, we expect the reported discount rate to decline by a greater amount than Q1 during the second quarter due to a prior year benefit related to certain merchant rebate accruals. During the second half of the year, we expect a more modest decline in the discount rate as we will no longer have any spending at Costco where we earn a lower than average discount rate. Coming back to the calculated discount rate, it was down seven basis points in the quarter, driven in large part by the five basis point decrease in the reported discount rate. The two basis point gap versus the decline in the reported rate was driven primarily by continued strong growth in cash rebate rewards. At Investor Day, we also committed to estimating our revenue growth rates excluding Costco, which we have included on slide 10. I'd remind you that there is some judgment in this estimation. Based on our analysis, Costco-related revenues were down approximately 11% year-over-year during Q1. As a result, we estimate that our FX-adjusted revenue growth rate, excluding the impact of Costco, improved modestly during the first quarter to approximately 5%. As we discussed at Investor Day, adjusted for the impact of Costco, we remain focused on achieving revenue growth above the 4% level that we generated in 2015 during the second half of this year. I would point out that we had an unusual benefit in discount revenue in Q2 2015 that will impact the revenue growth rate next quarter. Turning to credit performance, provision increased by 3% versus the prior year, as you can see in the chart on the left side of slide 11. But this result reflects the impact of the held-for-sale accounting changes. Credit costs for the held-for-sale portfolios are now recorded through a valuation allowance within operating expenses and are no longer included in provisions. When you also exclude those credit costs from the prior year, adjusted provision increased by 12%, as shown on the right side of slide 11. The growth in adjusted provision was driven by an increase in adjusted loan balances, including the strong growth of our merchant financing products. Card Member lending write-off rates were slightly lower year-over-year and remained the lowest amongst large peer issuers. Consistent with our comments from Investor Day going forward, we expect that continued growth in loans and some modest upward pressure on our write-off rates due primarily to the seasoning of loans related to new Card Members will both contribute to an increase in provision. That said, we remain very pleased with our loan growth and believe it is driving healthy economic returns. So now turning to expenses on slide 12, total expenses were up 5% and grew by 7% on an FX-adjusted basis. This reflected a higher level of spending on growth initiatives and was influenced by a number of items in both the current and prior year. Marketing and promotion increased by 19% versus the prior year, reflecting an elevated level of investment spending. In recent years, our marketing and promotion spend was low during the first quarter and then ramped up for the year beginning in Q2. Going forward, as part of our effort to optimize investments, we intend to spread more evenly the spend across all four quarters. We continue to expect that the total full year spending on growth initiatives during 2016 will be consistent with 2015 levels. As we've discussed, one of the key focus areas for our incremental spending on growth initiatives is driving new card acquisitions. In this context, we are pleased to see that these efforts drove 2.1 million new cards acquired across our U.S. issuing businesses during the current quarter, and nearly 1 million more from our international issuing businesses, which remains well above the average level of card acquisitions in prior periods. These results include new cards from Costco co-brand Card Members who have signed up for another American Express product, which has been a significant driver of the higher acquisitions in recent quarters. An increasing portion of the new card acquisitions are also coming through digital channels, as digital represented almost two-thirds of global consumer acquisitions this quarter. Coming back to the other drivers of expense performance, the year-over-year change in rewards expense was relatively in line with reported billed business growth. Cost of Card Member services grew by 8% during the quarter, which is significantly lower than its 2015 growth rate as we have now lapped the reset impact from our renewed co-brand relationships. Operating expenses were up 2% on a reported basis during Q1 2016 but were influenced by a number of items, including the benefit from the JetBlue gain, the restructuring charge, higher investment levels and some specific benefits in the prior year. We continue to have a strong focus on controlling operating expenses and remain focused on reducing our cost base by $1 billion on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. Towards this effort, we did incur the $84 million restructuring charge this quarter and expect to incur additional charges in future quarters, which in aggregate, we expect to be significant as we fully roll out our cost reduction plans. Finally, I did want to highlight that we expect operating expenses to be down significantly year-over-year during Q2 as the estimated $1 billion gain on the Costco portfolio sale will be recorded as a benefit in operating expenses. Now, shifting to our capital performance on slide 13. During the quarter, we returned 99% of the capital we generated to shareholders while maintaining strong capital ratios. We continue to believe that our ability to return a high level of capital to our shareholders over the past several years, while maintaining our capital ratios, illustrates the strength of our balance sheet, and business model. We did, of course, complete our submission for the 2016 CCAR process earlier this month, and as I'm sure you're all aware, the process continues to evolve each year. While our 2016 CCAR submission reflected the benefit to our capital ratios from the Costco portfolio sale, I'd remind you that the submission also reflected a number of other changes versus the prior year, including the loss of Costco related economics, our reduced earnings outlook for 2016 to 2017, and a more challenging set of economic assumptions in the Fed's severe scenario. Our capital plan for the upcoming year will clearly be dependent upon the Fed's view of our capital adequacy, and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June. So let me now conclude by stepping away from some of the complexity I just took you through and going back to the key themes in our results and outlook for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance during the quarter was in line with the expectations we outlined at Investor Day. We continue to believe that our earnings per share outlook for 2016 and 2017 remains appropriate. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our key initiatives to accelerate growth, and optimize investments including driving new card acquisitions across our global and consumer portfolios, expanding our merchant footprint and increasing our share of U.S. card lending. We also remain focused on controlling our expenses, and the restructuring charge this quarter reflected the initial phase of actions to take $1 billion out of our cost base by the end of 2017. We recognize that we're operating in a new reality and we're focused on our plan to increase revenues and substantially reduce our costs. We continue to believe that the strength of our business model will allow us to drive profitable growth.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, Jeff. As a reminder, our ongoing goal is to provide a greater opportunity for more analysts to ask a question during the Q&A session. Therefore, before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation in this process. With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Cathy?\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question will come from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Go ahead, please.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the detail on Costco and JetBlue. I guess, my one question would be, when you think about the growth rate in the second half of the year, you saw a little pickup this quarter. Do you think that the trends you're seeing in the business, the investments you're making, we can see the billed business continue to accelerate all else being equal? Or is it too early to say at this point? And also when it comes to the international markets, what do you expect to the interchanges in the EU, has that had the impact on billed business at this point? Or is it only on the interchange on the discount revenue side? Thank you.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Chris. A couple of questions there. So, we tried last month at our Investor Day to lay out some level of detail, both our expectations for 2016 and 2017, as well as the really key initiatives that we are focused on in both the accelerating revenue side as well as the cost side to achieve those results. As I sit here this afternoon and talk about our first quarter results, as I said in my remarks, I'd say we're tracking with all the both initiatives we're focused on, and we're tracking with the expectations we laid out. You are correct that we feel good today about our efforts to accelerate growth, and we feel good, in particular, about some of our ability to put other AmEx cards into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. Clearly, in the second half of the year, we will be very focused on maintaining the loyalty of those and other customers. There will be a lot of change in the industry in the back half of the year, and that's why I added just a few words of caution about the fact that we think we've taken a very balanced view as we provide you an outlook for the back half. But we'll have to see. It's still very early, but so far so good. In terms of the European Union, you're right, the new interchange caps went into effect in December \u2013 early December of last year. To remind everyone, while those don't directly impact American Express, we've said for quite a while now that over a period of time as we, on an ongoing basis, negotiate contracts with merchants, we would expect that to put some downward pressure on our discount rates, to some extent if you think about it, it keeps pressure to keep the differential, because we generally have a premium in most of those markets somewhat in line with its history. So that impact you do see reflected in our Q1 results. It's one of the reasons that you see an unusual decline in the discount rates. By historical standards, it will probably take us a couple of years to work through a negotiating cycle with all the merchants. In terms of the impact on volumes, we feel pretty good about the volume trends in Europe in Q1, and we feel pretty good about them in the U.K., in particular. We are very focused on using all the aspects of our business model and our closed loop to really create and sustain great value propositions for our customers. We think we have a tremendous ability to do that, and the interchange caps create some competitive challenges for others and perhaps some opportunities for us. So, we'll have to see how all that plays out over time, but right now we're pleased.\nChristopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Broker. Please go ahead.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Loan growth was definitely accelerated faster than we had expected. Could you talk about perhaps the breakdown of loan growth coming from new card holders versus growing lending balances with existing cardholders? And if there's any change in the credit profile of these incoming balances? Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thanks for the question, Craig. Yeah, we do feel good about the last several years. I do want to keep coming back to our performance and our ability to grow our lending book, which is predominantly U.S. consumer, at rates above what you're seeing in the industry is not a new trend. It's something we've been doing for a few years. You've seen a modest increase in the differential between us and the industry, but the whole industry, as you know, Craig, has also trended up a little bit this year. When you look at the composition of the Q1 increases, as Doug Buckminster talked about it at Investor Day, it's about one-third coming from existing customers and about two-thirds from new customers. And when you look at the credit profile, we continue to feel really good about our success in achieving these growth rates some time ago, sustaining them, and doing it in a way that keeps our average credit profile quite consistent with our history. So we think there's a lot of reasons we've been able to do this, and there's a lot of reasons we should be able to continue to do it for a long time, when you look at the fact that we historically under-index on the portion of our own customers and people who look like our customers' borrowing behaviors. And so we think with our renewed focused on having the right products, the right marketing, the right offers, out in the marketplace to better attract our fair share of those behaviors that we have a long runway to continue to achieve the kind of performance you saw in Q1.\nCraig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening. So, just a question on the new account conversion, the spending, that seems a little bit slower than years past. And I was just wondering is that because of the core shrinking kind of offsetting that? Or is it just that those new accounts aren't converting the spending as quick as in the past? And then just a very quick clarification on the caution, Jeff, that you cited in the second half. Is that just that those Costco card holders that have new AmEx card products stopped using that product or are there other items that we should be considering? Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Two good questions, Sanjay. I think when you look at the cycle, if you will, from when you put a new card into someone's hand to when it begins to get used, when for those who are going to be revolvers, balances begin to build up, there is a historical average that would probably cause us to say you're going to see the real meaningful financial impact begin to \u2013 or positive financial impact begin to happen more in the second year and third year, partly driven by the fact that historically in the industry we have a range of incentives and offers that go with the card acquisition. In the current competitive environment, I would say that's true now. So one of the factors, as you think, Sanjay, about some of the comments we've made about being very focused on seeing acceleration in our revenue growth, adjusting for Costco, in the back half of the year is as we just look at the sheer math of the various new Card Members that we've acquired in recent quarters as they age through the process I just described, you will begin to see an uplift as we get into the back half of this year. In terms of my cautionary comments, you're correct, there is nothing more than really me flagging what I think should be obvious to everyone, which is the size and magnitude of the portfolio transfer we are about to engage in on the Costco portfolio with Citi is, I think, pretty unprecedented in the industry. So that just makes us slightly cautious about our own forecasting abilities in terms of how consumers will behave, because we don't have a perfect precedent for all of the conditions that we see changing in the industry. And it would manifest itself as you point out, Sanjay, through what behavior Costco co-brand Card Members who have some other AmEx product which they may have had for a long time, or short time, how their behavior changes if they can't use the AmEx card at Costco. And for that matter, how AmEx Card Members, not Costco co-brand Card Members, but just other types of AmEx Card Members who traditionally do some portion of their shopping at Costco, how their behavior changes. So all that is factored into our outlook with what we think is a fairly balanced perspective on the ups and downs, but there's probably a little bit more forecasting error than I would say is usual for us.\nSanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead, please.\nBob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. The OptBlue program and other merchant expansion programs, as you said, Jeff, have been a huge initiative for American Express. Can you give us some feel for the uplift in spend that you're seeing from the merchant expansion efforts that you're making in the U.S. and in other markets and any update on your progress.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So let me focus, Bob, mostly on the U.S. You're correct. We're rolling out programs similar in spirit to OptBlue in various other countries. They have to vary because the acquiring landscape, the regulatory landscape varies in every country, but those programs tend to be newer than OptBlue which we've now been at for a couple years. That said, we've said from the beginning that it's a multi-year effort to get to where we want to get to with OptBlue. One of the targets we laid out for the first time at Investor Day, you know, Bob, a few weeks ago, was saying we think we can get to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. And I think we're always cautious in saying you have to get to parity coverage in reality first, and then you have to also take some time to let the perception of that coverage also catch up to the reality. So this is a long game we're playing. We are pleased with how it's going in terms of our ability at this point to say we have merchant acquirers who are part of the program who basically cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S. Not all of those acquirers, though, a few of the big ones still will be rolling out as we go through the rest of the year. So \u2013 so it's a long game, we think it's going fine, but the really material impacts take some number of years to really be seen in the financials. In the meantime, the point I was trying to make in my remarks is in the short term, even before perceptions change and perceptions changing will ultimately help you with the acquisition response rate with overall share of wallet, et cetera, but in the near term, you clearly get the incremental spend of the incremental merchants you're signing up. There is the lower discount rate impact fee every quarter. There's also some savings on the OpEx side because we used to pay some fees to our third-party acquirers we're not paying anymore. When you net those three pieces together, ignoring any potential share of wallet or acquisition efficiency benefits, that number turned positive in 2015. It's a very modest number. So it's not a number overall you would go notice in the financials because remember, coverage is about small merchants who are really important to the perceptions of coverage but, in fact, don't drive that many or that big a percentage of the overall spend dollars. So that's where we are. We feel good about the program. We feel good that it's today on a pathway where it's having a positive impact on the P&L. But the really larger vision and more material impact is clearly some time away.\nBob P. Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\nRichard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. The 3 million new account number that you cite, I assume, is a gross number. And I'd like to parse that a little bit. You made the comment that if there's about 2.1 million domestic and that that number is being influenced by the conversion of some of the Costco customers. As I recall, there were about 10 million accounts. So I'd love to get a sense of where you stand, sort of how far along you think you are in potentially converting those customers so that we get a sense of how much of that's organic growth versus how much is retention of those existing customers.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, that's a good question, Rick, and I think you're probably not surprised to say I'm a little cautious about giving you precise numbers right now for competitive reasons. But let me try to help you and others think a little bit about the magnitude here. We showed a slide, not this quarter but I think the last two quarters a little bit of his \u2013 two quarters ago, with a little bit of history on card acquisitions and you're right. These are gross numbers. We don't net out attrition through attrition hasn't changed a lot the last couple of years. There's some lumpiness and attrition because there are times when we'll embark on a program where we take inactive accounts and terminate them. But attrition materially hasn't changed much in a few years. So that slide two quarters ago will give you a little bit of a sense for some of the historical numbers to compare that 2.1 million to. And as I said in my remarks, some good portion of the increment above the standard run rate, though not all, is driven by the success we've had in putting other AmEx products into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. When you think about retention, I'd just remind you, though, of a couple other things we've said over the course of the past year. One is that we talked a while back about how in Canada, where there was no portfolio sale, at one point last year, we talked about retaining a little over 50% of the out-of-store spend. And when we said that, we were very quick to say, and in the U.S., you would expect the number to be significantly lower because there is a portfolio sale. And because we have been and continue to operate under a series of contractual restrictions about how we can market to Costco co-brand Card Members, and once the sale happens in mid-June, those Card Members will no longer be known to us, and they will be customers of one of our competitors. So that should produce a very different result. Within the box I just tried to paint for you, though, I would say we're pleased with our results thus far. But I will go back a little bit to my response to Sanjay's question and say the real battle for the hearts and minds of our customers is still in its early stages, I would say.\nRichard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And in the context of the idea that you want to convert existing charge card customers to borrowers, when a card customer elects to have the option to pay over time, does that count as a new card?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I think \u2013 so you're correct, Rick. If you are a charge card holder we have a product, we call LOC, lending on charge, that allows you to carry a balance. And some portion of our loan growth comes from our probably renewed focus on both marketing that product, making it easy for our customers to use, and some of our customers really like that. That would not count as a new card. But it is one of the things \u2013 one of the many things we're doing to help drive a little higher growth in our loan balances. I think it is important to point out though, Rick, another change though you have seen really over the last couple of years is a little bit of a renewed focus by us on making sure we also have the right lending-oriented products. And I think the launch of the EveryDay card is a good example of that in recent years. Clearly, there's a lot of focus these days on the cash-back market and we think our Blue Cash card is a very competitive and generally lending-oriented card in that space. So, yeah, we talk a lot about the breadth of our product line and we really believe in the breadth of our product line, because it allows us to have many different kinds of value propositions so we can reach out to many different segments of the marketplace. And I think our efforts around lending, whether it be what we're doing for charge Card Members through LOC, or some new products like EveryDay, or some products that have been around for a little while like Blue Cash are all manifestations of that strategy of having a very targeted and broad product strategy.\nRichard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Jeff, thank you, as always for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from David Ho with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.\nDavid Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Circling back on, again, the variability and your ability to forecast customer behavior in the second half of the year, and really getting to the Costco card that has been offered, the replacement card, was the value proposition that meaningfully different than what you were expecting? And how does that impact the range of rewards and investment spend as part of your strategy?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, let me maybe, David, make a few comments. I don't want to make too many specific comments about a competitor's product. I would point out though that obviously we were quite engaged in negotiations with Costco ourselves. And as part of any co-brand negotiations, you talk a lot about the value proposition as part of the negotiation. So I don't think we were particularly surprised. I'd make a few other points, though, and I'm going to go back actually to something I just said in response to Rick. We really focus on and think a strength of ours is the breadth of our product line and the way that allows us to have different value propositions for different segments of the market. There is not one cash-back market. There's not one rewards market. There's lots of different customer segments, and they value different things. The Citi Costco product will be a good product that will appeal to a certain demographic, a certain segment. I would point out it's sort of a cash-back product. You can actually only use it, including our co-brand card, at Costco in terms of the rewards. And if you look at our cash-back portfolio, the Blue Cash product, we feel really good about that value proposition. It has been a real \u2013 one of the real engines of customer acquisition for us. It's got good economics. It is a lend-oriented product to some of my comments fairly earlier. And it seems to compete very well in the face of the current competitive landscape, which in pure math probably includes some products that are a little richer than the Costco co-brand. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are. And I wouldn't anticipate that there's anything that we've seen in the latest announcements that will cause us to change our current strategies. I also want to come back, David, to your comments about the second half. Maybe I want to be a little careful here and not overplay the forecast uncertainty in the second half. The reason I brought it up is I thought I was stating something fairly obvious, which is that it is an unprecedented change in the industry. We are trying very hard to be transparent and balanced in our outlook. And so as we have said for quite some time, the second half by definition includes a little bit more uncertainty. But there's really nothing new about our view there. There's nothing new that we've seen in the marketplace that caused us to be any less certain. And in fact, with each passing week, we know more than we knew the week before.\nDavid Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then your comments about the rewards and kind of the diversity of your programs versus the industry, what do you think are some of the key enhancements? We've seen some merchant-funded rewards that are obviously enabled and facilitated by your closed loop. You've seen a little bit on the coalition rewards. Does part of the strategy entail making certainly the spend activity and lend activity from every dollar of rewards more meaningful than your competitors? Is that something that you're focused on, not just the earn rate?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I think, David, that's a good question. I think I'd actually broaden your statement a little bit. So in our experience, customers make decisions for many different reasons and value different things. And we really try to focus on both having different products that target what each customer segment most values and trying to think about and really leverage the things that we can most uniquely offer. So the strength of our brand is the first thing I think you always have to start with, which is the strength of our brand and its reputation for high-level service, and trust, and really taking the side of our customers is something that I think is hard for others to match, and we think is something that allows us to appeal to customers as something that is difficult for a competitor to copy. When you look at the rewards oriented customer, the breadth and depth and size of our membership rewards program allows us to offer a range of ways for people to use what's really an alternative currency in some way. It is very difficult for others to match, because they just don't have the size and scale of the program we have. When you look at our closed loop network, you're correct. It allows us to do some things on the offer side in particular not only do some things that are merchant funded, but also do some things that use our evolving big data capabilities to be very targeted in ways that are difficult for others to match. We have the lowest fraud rates in the industry, which is part \u2013 one part of the advantages of our closed loop, very difficult for others to match. So I could go on, and we should go on to the next question, but the point I'm trying to make is we are all about trying to think about the unique things we can offer to a customer that derive from our unique position as a closed loop global network with a great brand and great reach, rather than just say this is about mathematically competing on one particular aspect of a card's economics.\nDavid Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. Jeff, you clearly spent a lot of time thinking about the revenue and spend and lend contribution from Costco. Could you give us a sense, maybe even if it's not a precise number, as to how much of the remainder is actually due to those customers that have taken an AmEx card in replacement of the Costco card? And therefore, what it might have \u2013 what benefit it might have been to the company's growth in the first quarter. And similarly, did you also analyze what the leap year impact was on this year's \u2013 on the acceleration of the growth rate?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So two good questions, Moshe. So the leap year, there's a little bit of arc but obviously it's somewhere around 1% in terms of billings. You could have an interesting discussion about customer behaviors, so there's an extra day in a month, but it's probably somewhere around 1%. You have other year-over-year factors as you think about the quarter as well. I would point out you have lower gas prices, we're particularly T&E oriented probably more than most, so lower airline ticket prices in my old industry probably impact us as well. When you think about Costco, as I said in my remarks, when you look at the incremental cards we're acquiring, a significant portion of the increment is driven by those efforts but other AmEx products into the hands of Costco co-brand Card Members. I don't want to be more specific for competitive reasons beyond that. What I would say is that's also part of what drives our statement as I said earlier that we'd expect as you get into the back half of this year and next year, a little bit further uptick in the financial metrics, because as we put those cards in the hands of people, it does take some time before you really see a meaningful financial impact, you've got to put the card in people's hands. They slowly start to build spend, lend takes a while to build, et cetera. So those are probably the added comments I would make about our Q1 metrics, Moshe.\nMoshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll go next to James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead, please.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. I just wanted to ask about the target, the eventual parity in merchant acceptance. Is all of that incremental parity going to come through OptBlue? And would it make sense at some point to re-compete part of the GMS portfolio with outsourced merchant acquirer processing?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, let me \u2013 again, let me make sure I know exactly where you're going with the question. The answer to the first part is pretty straightforward. Yes. When you look at our coverage today versus that of the two dominant networks, it's really \u2013 the gap is all about small merchants for the most part with very rare exceptions like Costco which only accepts AmEx today. And medium and large size merchants generally we deal with directly and our coverage is pretty much at parity. So it's really all about the small merchants, and that's where we clearly concluded that we need the arms and legs and help of the third-party merchant acquirers to reach the many, many, many millions of small merchants where there is a fair amount of churn as well to get them into our network. That's also why as we just look at the sheer math the fact that we now have agreements with merchant acquirers who cover 99% of the merchants in the U.S., we feel pretty confident in saying it's a matter of time before they are able to put us into all of those merchants. So that's the logic behind OptBlue and how the small merchants fit in with the medium to large merchants. So the question is, are we learning anything in OptBlue that would cause us to change our view about the direct connections we have with the larger merchants? I would say the short answer is no. We really value those connections. I think the merchants value them. We are able because of the closed loop \u2013 this goes to some of the comments I made earlier we think to bring some value to those relationships that are not always easy for others to match and so we very much want to keep those connections.\nJames Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Go ahead, please.\nMatt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Jeff, just a clarification on the provision for loan losses. Has the reserve release fully come out of the Costco sale now? Just want to get a starting point in terms of how we think about building provisions going forward once the Costco is out and that 12% adjusted that you kind of \u2013 will we see any more reserve releases? Is that part of the $1 billion gain? And where should we look at the starting point for that? And then just one follow-up on just interest rates, how do we think about that in your guidance? Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, let me make sure I \u2013 jump in if I don't quite answer this or your whole question. But I think you're just after \u2013 if you look at Costco, the provision now all appears down in OpEx and is treated in effect as a valuation allowance against the held-for-sale portfolio that is on the balance sheet net, if you will. So that's why in the [storage] slides we had kind of a left-hand side which shows you the GAAP numbers, and the right-hand side were to provide you comparability if we stripped all the Costco-related provision out of the prior year, because that should give you a very clean view into the run rate that you will see beginning in the third quarter, because that will be the first quarter where the Costco portfolio was gone for the entire quarter. So I think if you just trend off that right-hand side of the slide, that should give you a pretty clean view into Costco. And I think your second question was around interest rates?\nMatt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC: Right, yes, just \u2013 yeah, the outlook there, are you just looking at the forward curve, and is that kind of all there is to it?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You know, we certainly don't profess to have any view that others don't that allows us to forecast interest rates. I'd also remind you of two things. Because our company economics are 75% to 80% discount revenue and fee revenue driven, we are far less interest rate sensitive than our competitors and peers, and because of our charge card franchise, we're the opposite of most of our peers in that a rising interest rate environment is not positive for us. That said, if you looked to Q1, the reality is it takes a while for particularly our funding rates to adjust much, so I would guess that the Fed's December rate rise was probably pretty neutral for us on balance in Q1. I don't think it really had a material impact one way or the other.\nMatt P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, Jeff, do you have any updated thoughts on the timing of the DOJ case? I know there was some talk around it at the Investor Day. And then in relation to that, how should we think about your 2017 guidance? Do you have enough cushion built in should you lose that case, or is it more of a long-term issue where we don't need to worry about that for guidance?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, in terms of the case, I'd say we could hear anywhere from tomorrow morning to a year from now. There's just no way to know really what the timeline is, the appellate court finished their hearings some months back. As you recall, very importantly, and very unusually, after or around the hearing, they chose to reinstate a stay on the district judge's order. That's quite unusual for a court to do. But we'll have to see where the opinion comes out and as I said we really just have no insights into the timing. You know, is it contemplated in our 2016 and 2017 outlook? Obviously, we'll have to see what the judge says. I guess I'd make a couple of comments. One, the district judge's order was fully implemented for some number of months until the appellate court put a stay back on it. So it's not \u2013 there you certainly didn't see any immediate impact in that instance. And clearly, we wouldn't be fighting this case and going to court with the federal government if we didn't think there was a very important and fundamental issue at stake here. I would say it's a very important and fundamental long-term issue.\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. I got the sense at the Investor Day that was more of a \u2013 you thought you could hear something in the very short term, but I guess that's not the case.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, yeah, that was some weeks ago and we haven't heard a word. And truly we have no insights into when the court might issue. I'm not even sure we get any advanced notice. I think they just posted to their website. We see it as others see it, so...\nDonald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Go ahead, please.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Good evening. Hi, Jeff. I was hoping that you could help us think through the Costco gain in a little bit more detail. And I guess when we think about this quarter, we saw that JetBlue gain was entirely offset by marketing and promotion. And that seems very consistent with how AmEx has handled similar types of gains in the past. But as we look ahead at Costco, that's going to be a much larger gain. And you also said that you were going to be spreading out your investment spending more evenly. So should we, putting those pieces together, conclude that we're going to see potentially a bigger portion of the Costco gain next quarter drop to the bottom line? And maybe you'll kind of save some of the reinvestment opportunity for later quarters?\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Bill, I think you got it just right. Just to confirm, and I'd play back what you said using slightly different words. So, yes, we expect the Costco gain to come in, in June, approximately $1 billion. Unlike previous years, we are spreading across evenly throughout the year our investment or growth-oriented spend, the biggest chunk of which appears in marketing and promotion. So to be very granular, that means that if you just look at our marketing and promotional line for all of 2016, you should expect it to look about like it did in 2015. And in fact, you just saw us in Q1 raise Q1 closer to an average level that you will see across the next three quarters. So that's what you'll see on the marketing and promotional line. And so really, the gain will mostly, to your point, fall to the bottom line in the second quarter although I do think there's one other important caveat to remind people, which is we do expect more restructuring charges, including some, hard to quantify right now, in the second quarter and those would be some incremental offset to the gain as well. And those restructuring charges, just to be crystal clear, because of the challenge in trying to estimate them, we have, as we provided our $5.40 to $5.70 EPS outlook, said that excludes all restructuring charges this year, just to give you a clearer, cleaner view into the performance of the company.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That's great. Thank you. And maybe if I could dovetail off of Rick's question earlier. Could you also add what customer acquisition costs looked like relative to history? I just wanted to follow up with that and that's it. Thank you very much.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I guess a way, if you \u2013 the way to think about that, Bill, would be to say if you go to Investor Day, I made the point that as you roll into 2017, you should expect to see our marketing and promotional costs come down $200 million to $400 million. And most, though not 100%, but most of our customer acquisition costs appear in that line. And so that gives you maybe some rough sense of the level of elevation. If that line is $3.5 billion this year and you're talking about a $300 million, let's pick a midpoint, decrease that says maybe you're coming down 10% next year, which also implies that you're sort of elevated 10% this year. So it's an important increment in light of the goal we have around the spend and lend of the Costco co-brand Card Members. It's an important percentage in terms of the competitive environment. But I think sometimes people overplay just how big that increment is as we get ever more efficient with our acquisition efforts every year, and I made the point that two-thirds of our consumer acquisitions in Q1 were digital. It's those kind of statistics that would give us confidence that we can continue to edge that number down without seeing a significant impact on our acquisition efforts.\nBill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: And I think we have time, Cathy, for just one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. That will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thanks. I was hoping to get a little bit more color and commentary around the economics of the Cash Blue card, which sounds like it's a pretty meaningful contributor here to loan growth. And also the impact on rewards costs if you factored in cash-backs, I believe you treat those as a contra-revenue. And the reason I'm asking is because it seems like it has the potential to be maybe the most expensive product you have if customers look to optimize. I'm just looking at the current offer and it's 0% on balances for the first 12 months, 10% cash-back on wireless phone service, 6% on supermarket spend, and 3% on gas. So, if a customer really optimized, you could have cash-back expense far in excess of what your blended discount rate is. So, just interested to hear your thoughts on that.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I'm going to go back a little bit, Mark, to some of my earlier comments about what we try to do at American Express with all of our products is leverage all of the attributes of the company and our brand. And so, we are not particularly trying to target, to use your term, the gamers. And in fact, we'll work a little bit to specifically not attract the gamers. So, we feel pretty good, I would say, on balance about the economics of the Blue Cash card. And certainly one of the things we watch is the overall portfolio of consumer cards that we have in the U.S. or for that matter in any market. And so when you look at our card acquisitions, yes, the Blue Cash card has been a particular important acquisition engine in recent quarters, but I'd point out to you that's because part of what we're trying to do is put replacement cards in the hands of people who formerly had a Costco co-brand card. And so the Blue Cash card tends to appeal to that segment of the market. Meanwhile, we've continued our historical acquisition efforts with Gold, with Platinum, the Delta card is going tremendously well, and I think you've heard Delta make some comments about that as well. So, we have a range of products, and Blue Cash is just one of them which appeals to a particular segment is lend oriented and is producing perfectly fine economics for us. In terms of an overall rewards rate, we don't really look at it that way. I guess what I'd say is certainly rewards costs, the cash rebate rewards costs are growing faster than our company average, because those products are growing faster than the company average. And you see me calling that out a little bit in my discussion earlier about the calculated discount rate. There is still a very modest piece of the overall company's cards and economics, though, is one important thing to keep in mind. So, look, I'd say this is all part of our strategy of having the broadest product line and offering lots of different value propositions. We make sure that all of the value propositions are economic for our shareholders while providing good value to customers, and I think the Blue Cash card fits right into that vein.\nMark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.\nJeffrey C. Campbell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mark.\nToby Willard - Head of Investor Relations: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call tonight, and we appreciate your continued interest in American Express. That's all for us, Cathy.\nOperator: Thank you.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Toby Willard. Please go ahead, sir.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Kerry. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the fourth quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Toby and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be here to recap the strong finish we had to our two-year game plan and to lay out our expectations for 2018. Let me start with 2017. As you can see in this afternoon\u2019s earnings release, like all U.S. companies, our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results reflect some onetime impacts stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted for the impact of the Tax Act, which I will come back to in a minute, we earned $1.58 in the fourth quarter and $5.87 for the full year, in line with the increased guidance we gave at the end of Q3 when we said we expected to earn between $5.80 and $5.90 for the year. Just as important as these EPS outcomes was the strong momentum we continued to see in the business, with success executing against each of the three priorities we set out in our game plan at the beginning of 2016, accelerating revenue growth; optimizing our investments; and resetting our cost base. In fact, billings and revenue growth reached multiyear highs in Q4 2017. And we are particularly pleased with the diversity of the drivers of our growth and the linkage between the many changes and investments we have made over the last couple of years and where we now see growth. So, we end 2017 with momentum and close out the two-year game plan period having surpassed the financial objectives that we laid out in early 2016. We now start a new chapter in 2018, and of course, starting in February, we will have a new CEO. We are all fortunate to have worked with an incredible leader in Ken Chenault, who has done a remarkable job over his 37 years with the Company. As we now turn the page to Steve Squeri, I would echo what Ken said in his comments in our earnings release, the Company is in very strong hands going forward with our new CEO. As we move ahead in 2018, we will be focused on the four key priorities that Steve laid out on last quarter\u2019s call, strengthening our leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending our leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium-sized enterprises; playing an even bigger role in the digital lives of our customers; and strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value. Now, of course, beyond these core focus areas of business growth, 2018 will also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate, which I will come back to in discussing our 2018 guidance as we wrap up the call. With that, let me turn to the results, starting on slide two, where you see revenues in Q4 of $8.8 billion, growing at 9% adjusted for FX, reflecting accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees. Net income and EPS for the quarter were both impacted by the passage of the Tax Act. And as I mentioned a moment ago, to provide a bit more detail, we recognized the Tax Act impact in the quarter of $2.6 billion, which is primarily composed of two pieces. First, given the global nature of our business, we recognized approximately $2 billion of taxes on deemed repatriations of certain overseas earnings; and second, we recognized a roughly $600 million charge related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax assets to the lower rate of 21%. This $2.6 billion represents our current estimate, which is slightly higher than the estimate we previously disclosed. We will continue to evaluate the implications of the Tax Act as guidance and interpretations evolve. The $2.6 billion and tax-related charges caused us to report a quarterly loss on a GAAP basis. Excluding this amount, adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and earnings per share for Q4 was a $1.58, in line with our expectations. Turning briefly to the full year results. Revenue of $33.5 billion for the year was up 4%. Adjusted revenue growth accelerated steadily through the year, starting at 7% in Q1 and ending at 9% in Q4. Our reported growth rate for the full year of course includes in the comparison two quarters of revenue related to the Costco relationship in the prior year. As you can see on the right side of slide two, full year earnings per share adjusted for the tax charges is $5.87. Moving now to our metrics, starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several views of, on slides three through five. Before we get into the details, I would quickly point out that reported billings growth was 11% in the quarter, our first double-digit billings growth quarter in some time. This is partly due to the dollar weakening year-over-year versus the major currencies we operate in overseas but also reflects strong underlying growth. What you see on slide three is billings accelerated to 9% in the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis. Looking at the segment view on slide four, it is clear that we have strong momentum across our segments. And in the quarter, we saw acceleration in each segment from the Q3 growth rate which further illustrates the diversity of the drivers of our growth. Digging into this a bit deeper, on slide five, you see a view of billings growth that brings together several ways we have talked about our broad ranging growth opportunities. Our global commercial and global consumer segments were roughly the same size, representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively. Global network services makes up the remaining 17% of billings. Represented by the first three columns of the chart, our global commercial segment includes our small and midsized enterprise customers or SMEs as well as our large and global corporate customers. As a reminder, SMEs represent one of our highest growth areas, and you see that again this quarter with U.S. SME billings growing at 9% and international SME billings accelerating to 20% on an FX adjusted basis. The large and global customer segment grew 6% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter, up a bit sequentially from last quarter. And I would note that we also saw some sequential improvement in the overall T&E billings growth rate this quarter. Moving to U.S. consumer which makes up 31% of the Company\u2019s billings. We see 8% growth in the quarter and we are pleased by the acceleration and growth from Q3. International proprietary consumer continues to perform particularly strong with growth of 14% on an FX adjusted basis. Once again, we see robust proprietary growth in markets such as the UK, up 19%; Japan and Australia, up 16% each; and Mexico, up 13% on FX adjusted basis. And finally, our network business is up 6% on an FX adjusted basis. As we said before, evolving regulations in Europe and Australia are driving declining network volumes in these geographies. And as a result, we expect our proprietary international billings growth to continue to outpace our network partner billings, which you see again in this quarter\u2019s results. Overall, we are pleased with the billings growth we see across our business segments and geographies. Turning next to loan performance on slide six. Our growth in total loans was 14% and adjusted for FX, total loans grew at 13% in Q4, as we continue to penetrate the lending opportunity with our existing customers and add new customers. On the right, you can see that net interest yield began to stabilize sequentially in the fourth quarter at 10.5% as we have been expecting for some time. Our results in the quarter however are still benefiting from the growth in yield over the prior year, which is a result of the ongoing mix shift of revolving loans towards higher rate buckets and pricing actions we have taken. Turning next to credit metrics on slide seven where we see the write-off rates for our various portfolios. Starting with the lending portfolio on the left, the loss rate for the quarter was 1.8%, in line with the third quarter and up modestly from the prior year. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we do expect lending write-off rates to continue to increase in large part due to growth in non-cobrand lending products, which have higher loss rates as well as seasoning of the portfolio. On the right side, you can see loss rates in our charge portfolio, as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. With both, we see relatively stable performance, which we believe reflects the quality of our customer base and a stable economic environment. Moving to slide eight. Provision expense for the quarter was $833 million, up 33%. The growth in provision this quarter is in line with what we saw year-to-date through the third quarter and our comment on last quarter\u2019s earnings call. We continue to build reserves to account for loan growth seasoning and the mix shift over time away from cobrand products. As we\u2019ve said before, we see attractive opportunities to continue to grow lending across multiple fronts. Our absolute growth in net interest income well exceeds the growth in provision, and net interest income remains just 20% of our total revenues. Turning now to our revenue performance on slide nine. FX adjusted revenue accelerated to 9%. As you look at the adjusted revenue growth trend over the last several quarters, you can very clearly see our success in capturing the growth opportunities we\u2019ve highlighted over the last couple of years. While not on this slide, I would also point out that if you look at our segment results, the highest revenue growth is in our U.S. consumer segment at 13% for the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to grow even in the competitive U.S. consumer segment. Looking to the components of revenue on slide 10. We have healthy growth across all the lines. Discount revenue was up 8%, driven by the strong growth in billed business. Net card fees growth was 8%, driven by strong performance in the Platinum and Delta portfolios and growth in key international markets. Other fees and commissions grew 17% and 12% on an FX adjusted basis. The weaker dollar had a larger impact on this line. And other revenues declined 13% in the quarter though primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business that we sold in Q4 last year. Net interest income was up 23%, driven by the higher net interest yield and loan growth that I spoke about a few minutes ago.  So, turning now to slide 11 we\u2019ll look discount rate. The discount rate in the second half of 2017 was 2.41%, down 5 basis points from the prior year. So, ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.75%, down 4 basis points from last year. These changes within the range of our expectations, which we shared with you at our last Investor Day and which are shown on the right side of slide 11. As we turn to 2018, you may recall that on our Investor Day in March of last year, we expected a decline in the discount rate in 2018 of 2 to 3 basis points. As we look ahead now, we expect a larger year-over-year decline in 2018. This stems from the stronger growth we are seeing in places around the world with lower discount rates and also from decisions we have made about how best to grow our overall economics with some of our larger partners. Both of these factors are actually part of what will continue to drive the Company\u2019s overall revenue growth. Turning now to expenses on slide 12. I\u2019ll review marketing and promotion, rewards and card member services expenses as part of our card member engagement discussion on the next page. But first, let me cover operating expenses. Total operating expenses were down 2% from the prior year, as we continue to see the benefit of our cost reduction efforts. Let me pause here and make some final comments on our $1 billion cost reduction exercise. When we started this program in early 2016, we laid out specific plans to drive cost savings. And I am pleased to report that we have successfully executed on these plans. We have driven savings through headcount reductions, vendor negotiations, process changes, expense policy changes and many other initiatives. Throughout the year, as our business performance started to outpace our own plans, we took the opportunity to use some of these savings to selectively reinvest in the business, including in particular some incremental spending on sales force and technology which are part of our operating expenses. I would also point that in fourth quarter, we made an incremental contribution to our employee profit-sharing program of a little bit more than a $100 million related in part to our overall tax position in light of the new tax law and also the strong performance of the Company. In general, we feel good about our operating expense control efforts and we believe we are well-positioned to manage operating expense growth going forward. Moving to slide 13 and Card Member engagement spending. In the fourth quarter, total expense was $3.3 billion, flat versus the prior year. However, it\u2019s clear that we have made tradeoffs between the components of the spending. M&P was down 28% versus the prior year, partially due to significant investments we made in the second half of 2016 as well as a continued focus on creating more marketing efficiencies. Despite significantly lower spending, we added 2.5 million new proprietary cards globally in the fourth quarter, 1,000 more new cards than a year ago. Rewards expense growth in the quarter was 12%, just slightly above the 11% growth in proprietary billings as we lapped changes to the U.S. Platinum value propositions at the end of 2016. We continue to be pleased with our Platinum product performance in the U.S. and around the globe. In the U.S., we finished 2017 with our highest ever number of Platinum members and record levels of spend. Cost of Card Member services increased 39%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on Platinum. This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits and where we plan to continue to invest. Let me turn now to capital on slide 14. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve steadily returned capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs which continued through the fourth quarter as we returned $1.6 billion of capital. For the year, while we returned a 190% of the capital we generated, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our payout ratio would have been about 100%. Due to the Tax Act impact, of course, we ended the quarter with a net loss. The net loss combined with growth in the balance sheet and continued capital returns in Q4, resulted in a decline in our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.0%. For perspective, adjusted for the Tax Act impact, our common equity Tier 1 ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. So, our capital ratios are now below the level we had projected in the 2017 CCAR process. And as a result, we do not plan to use our remaining 2017 CCAR buyback authorization for the first half 2018. So, there will be no change to our dividends. The suspension of share buybacks will substantially rebuild our capital levels and ratios and better position us for the 2018 CCAR process. Over the next few months, as we develop our 2018 CCAR submission, our goal will be to get back on our trajectory towards capital ratios consistent with our plans prior to tax reform while supporting balance sheet growth in the business. Of course, most importantly, for the long-term, the new tax law does significantly lower our tax rate going forward, which increases the capital generating power of the business. Given the lower tax rate, we expect that over time, we will more than make up for any reductions in the buyback in 2018 and generate more earnings and return more capital than we would have without tax reform. And so, in summary, 2017 was a very strong year for the Company. We have come a long ways since early 2016, when we set the objective of delivering at least $5.60 of EPS for 2017. We exceeded that EPS goal on an adjusted basis, invested back into the business, and we believe we are set up well to grow as we go forward. Our strong 2017 performance sets the foundation for our 2018 expectations as we introduce a 2018 EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. The outlook is based on the current economic and regulatory climate. Let me provide a little perspective on the drivers behind our expectations, which are summarized in slide 15. Starting with revenue growth. We expect continued strong momentum in our billings and loans metrics as we capture the diverse growth opportunities we see across our customer segment. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect the discount rates to decline, but to also see continued momentum in other areas like card fee growth. As we look at all the moving pieces, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the 7% to 8%. Another important driver to consider for 2018 is our expanded agreements with two important cobrand partners Hilton and Marriott. We are excited about these partnerships and the platform for growth they give us over the next several years. Looking specifically at 2018, the purchase of the existing Citi/Hilton loan portfolio in the first quarter is expected to drive a little less than 100 basis points of revenue growth for the year. Incremental revenue from other new products we will be introducing, however, will phase in more gradually in future years. As you would expect, in today\u2019s competitive cobrand environment, the margins are lower on these partnerships, starting in January. And as a result, we expect to the overall impact of these renewals to reduce 2018 pretax earnings by more than $200 million versus 2017. To be very clear, these agreements generate attractive economics under the new terms, even though the margins are lower than before. And over the long run, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the portfolios and drive ongoing benefits for our customers, our partners and our shareholders. Next, let me talk a little about lending, building on the comments I made earlier. We expect the dynamic in 2018 to remain pretty consistent with 2017. Our loan growth is expected to exceed the industry as we continue to focus on increasing our share of lending, particularly with existing customers. Net interest yield has started to stabilize but is expected to still contribute to growth versus prior year. Lending write-off rates and delinquencies are expected to continue to increase, but we believe we will remain below the industry average. These dynamics together should again drive strong growth in net interest income as well as growth in provision for loss similar to the growth rate in 2017. And as a result, we again expect significant growth in the economics of the loan portfolio. Finally, as we thought about our overall tax position and the implications of the new Tax Act, we certainly broadly believe the new tax law is positive for the U.S. economy and in turn for American Express. We have reached a series of conclusions and decisions around this. First, while we are still evaluating recently released interpretations of the new tax law, we expect an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22% before discrete items. Second, as I mentioned, we decided to suspend our share repurchase program for the first two quarters in 2018, but we will continue dividend payments. Third, as we thought about our overall tax position and how to manage the impact from a Tax Act, we focused on three key constituents. First, employees. So, considering our tax situation as well as strong Company performance as I previously stated, we chose to support the long-term wellbeing of our employees by making it incremental contribution to our employee profit sharing programs, which in most cases go directly to employees\u2019 retirement accounts. Second, customers. So, consistent with our long history of balancing short, medium and long-term objectives, we now plan to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives in 2018 than we had originally planned prior to the passage of tax. And finally, shareholders. As the remaining tax benefits, we\u2019ll build capital and support earnings growth in 2018. All of these lead us to an earnings per share range of $6.90 to $7.30. Of course, there remains a lot of work to do in 2018 to deliver in this range, but our focus is to deliver against the plans we have set. Stepping back, before we move on to your questions, we are starting 2018 from a position of strength with the tremendous set of customers, strong momentum across our integrated payments model and opportunities to capture growth in many different parts of our business. At our Investor Day in early March, we look forward to providing more insight into our growth opportunities. And with that, let me turn it back over to Toby.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thanks for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Kerry?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to line of Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, Jeff. On the discount rate, as you look sort of further out, has the kind of base case of down 2 or 3 bps changed to where it\u2019s structurally higher or is 2018 just kind of based on some moves you\u2019ve made?\nJeff Campbell: Well, good question, Don. I guess, I\u2019d make a couple of comments. First, I think it\u2019s important to remember, the end objective here is to drive revenue growth. And we feel really good about the acceleration in revenue growth that we have achieved over the last two years and the fourth quarter results of 9%, the highest we\u2019ve shown in many years. And we did that with some significant declines in the discount rate above that historical 2% to 3% range. Now, why did that happen? Well, because we are very consciously making some decisions that we think drive more revenue growth but also have the impact of bringing that discount rate down. So, the decisions we\u2019re making around expanding coverage in the U.S. through the OptBlue program and some similar programs around the globe, some decisions we have made about how to best gain overall economics with some of our larger partners that had a positive impact on revenue and a more challenging impact on the discount rate, and of course regulation in certain places around the globe such as Australia, are doing some things to drive the discount rates down but also creating some opportunities for the kind of growth in our proprietary business that I talked about in my prepared remarks, in Australia and the UK for example which are both in the high teens. So, some of those things will clearly pay over time. The OptBlue program in the U.S. will begin to wind down as we get into 2019, and that pressure we\u2019ll receive. The impact of regulation in Australia and Europe which we\u2019ve been going through for -- in the case of Europe, a couple of years now; in the case of Australia, really just began again in July last year, those will fade a little bit over time. But, our objective is going to remain what can we do to drive the most revenue growth and that will have varied implications over time I think to the discount rates. So, we have line of sight into what we think is going to happen in 2018, both on revenue and we feel about the guidance of 7% to 8%, and on discount rate. Beyond that we will have to see what decisions make sense to drive the best overall economics for the Company. So, thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKen Bruce: Hi. Thank you and good evening. My question relates to the guidance. I am hoping you might be willing to unpack the provision growth commentary a little bit, just in terms of what you are expecting in terms of the absolute rise in losses relative to the reserve building. It\u2019s a pretty substantial growth that you are kind of pointing to on the provisions. So, I just want to make sure I understand that.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. I guess, I\u2019ll make a few comments. So, we\u2019ve now been at growing our lending a little bit faster than the industry for quite a number of years. And of course, we have a platform for doing that because we have historically so underpenetrated our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors. And so, I think we now have a multiyear track record of achieving above industry growth rates while still getting really good economics. Now, we\u2019ve pointed out for a while that particularly with the shift that began in the third quarter of 2016 to less lending on cobrand products, more lending on proprietary products, those products come with little higher write-off rates and pricing that also is reflective of that risk as well, thereby producing really good economics. Given that\u2019s when we started, we just as you got into the latter part of 2017 are beginning to hit sort of the key seasoning time period in a lot of the new lending that we have taken on and that\u2019s why we have said for almost two years now, we do expect this steady trend upwards in write-off rates and provision. It\u2019s been part of the plan all along. As we look at the great diversity in our lending portfolio, we draw a lot of comfort from the fact that other parts of our portfolio, the cobrand portfolio, some of the lending we do on our charge products or our lending on charge products, you see very little change in the write-off rates. So, what you see when you\u2019re looking at the average is that mix shift to more proprietary lending and the seasoning effect of the fact that we began an earnest to make that mix shift as you got into 2016. So all of that will lead you in 2018 to continued really good strong growth in net interest income. Now, we\u2019ll come with the same kind of growth in provisions that you saw in 2018 and the combination of those two should continue to produce really good economics for us. So, I guess, I\u2019d like to leave it at that Ken as opposed to also trying to provide a write-off metric. But, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about the continued growth opportunities ahead of us in this area for many years.\nOperator: And now to line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Jeff, I wonder if we could talk a little bit about some of the customer-facing initiatives that you\u2019re planning on using some of the tax windfall for the 200 million that you referenced in the press release and talked a little bit about. Be interested in understanding corporate customer-facing initiatives versus consumer and perhaps, you could give us a sense as to whether this is pulling forward what you already have been planning or is there something plus something new here that you\u2019re considering with this 200 million?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. All good questions, Betsy. Let me make a few comments. First, one of the luxuries, I suppose, of the diversity of the growth opportunities we have is that our constraint as a company on the levels of customer-facing growth investing we do each year is really not that we run out of opportunities with very attractive long-term economics, but more that we do manage the Company for a mixture of short, medium and long-term objectives. We believe, it\u2019s really important as a company and for our shareholders to show steady earnings growth every year. And so, when you look at the opportunities we have to invest for growth, generally in any given year, there are a variety of unfunded initiatives with good economics that we choose not to pursue, because doing so in the short run would not allow us to meet our financial objectives. That\u2019s why, if you think about the history of our Company over many years, that\u2019s why when we have from time-to-time have some kind of sudden financial windfall, upside, better than expected performance. We often put a little bit of that into our shareholders\u2019 pocket and we put a little bit to work funding some of these initiatives that we can\u2019t necessarily get to in the normal course of business. So that\u2019s really the context in which you should think about our decision once the Tax Act passed, to go ahead and increase in 2018 our customer facing growth investing by up to $200 million. And if you think about where those next best previously unfunded opportunities are, they are probably where you would expect it. So, if you look at our consumer business, I did point out in my remarks that the highest revenue growth segment in 2017 was the U.S. consumer segment. And so, even in the face of how competitive the U.S. consumer segment is, there are some really good results we\u2019re generating and some good opportunities we still have. When you look at the kind of growth we have with small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly outside the U.S. where we had 20% growth in billings in Q4 and you\u2019ve been in the teens for a number of years now, there are tremendous opportunities to continue to accelerate our growth. So, those are the kinds of things that you will see us with the last incremental dollar of investment likely pursue. But I think the broader and important point here is, we always tend to have a pool of rally good opportunities left unfunded. And what we felt was the right balance here was the majority of the Tax Act benefits fall through to the bottom line in 2018, but to take a portion and put it for work for the longer term.\nOperator: All right, thank you. And now to the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Hi, Jeff. Thank you. So, I just want to confirm one that you are guiding toward 36% year-on-year growth in the provision for 2018. And secondly, Platinum, the changes you\u2019ve made to Platinum obviously spurred some very aggressive growth and that\u2019s good to see. Are you seeing any tail-offs in that momentum going into 2018, or should we expect another very strong year for Platinum growth? And have you seen any reactions from competitors to the more experiential benefits you put on that card?\nJeff Campbell: Taking notes, Craig, to make sure I get all your questions.\nCraig Maurer: Sorry. I\u2019ve taken advantage.\nJeff Campbell: On provision, look, I\u2019m not trying to be quite as precise maybe as you were in the way you\u2019ve phrased the question. But, our point is we expect continued really strong growth in loans and continued -- you\u2019ll still have some benefits from net interest yields, so that\u2019s going to drive really good net interest income growth. And yes that will come with provision growth on a percentage basis that is somewhere in the vicinity of what you saw for calendar 2017. You look through all that map and it will produce really nice overall economics for us. Platinum, we are pretty pleased by. So, if you think about the Q4 results, with the highest revenue growth we\u2019ve seen in quite some time, well, fourth quarter was actually when we already began to lap the Platinum changes. That\u2019s actually why if you do the math of the rewards to billings ratio, while for the last four quarters you\u2019ve seen rewards going faster than billings, that\u2019s because of the Platinum changes. This quarter, it came back down to a much more normalized level where rewards were more consistent with billings. So, the fact that you continue to see strong performance in Platinum, the fact that you did not see any drop off in revenue growth, we feel really good about. And to end 2017 despite all the competition that you absolutely do see in the U.S. with a record level of Platinum members in the U.S., with record levels of spending and with our fee increase fully hitting customers now for some time, I think it is a tremendously strong confirmation of the differentiated value proposition we offer of the value of some of the experiential benefits and the fact that we have the courage because we believe in them to price for those benefits and that value proposition. And we think we as a result are going into 2018 with great moment around this product.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Since the starting point for the stress test is the December 31st balance sheet date, some investors are asking whether your relatively low CET1 starting point of 9% could also hurt your ask in the next -- in the 2018 CCAR cycle. Could you speak to that?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. Good question, Bill. I think, the really important thing to think about here is we run the Company for the long-term. And in the long-term, the lower tax rate is going to produce much higher earnings, much higher capital generation and therefore much higher capital returns than otherwise. In the long run, we need to get back to whatever the, as fed regulatory environment involves, whatever the appropriate steady state capital ratio is at any given point in time. So, the only question given the $2.6 billion charge we took is how quickly or in what pattern you get back to that steady state capital level. And so, we could have continued to repurchase shares in the first half of 2018 and then what you would have seen is a lower result as we go through the CCAR 2018 process. Our decision, which we feel very confident in, was no, look, let\u2019s just very quickly rebuild the capital that of course will be built into the CCAR 2018 process. So, this will we think produce in fact a much stronger CCAR 2018 result than if we chose to spread out a reduction in our share repurchases. And look, we\u2019ll have to see how the fed\u2019s thinking evolves because we\u2019re not the only CCAR participant in this situation. We will have to see how the rating agency thinking evolves. Although we\u2019ve begun those conversations as you would expect today and we are going fine. And I just want to end with the emphasis to people that we have a strong track record of being aggressive about returns of capital. We are going to produce more capital in the next couple of years than we otherwise would have that\u2019s going to drive bigger capital returns. We think the best way to get at that is to take a small pause and to do it at a time when if you think about our guidance, it\u2019s producing year-over-year EPS growth somewhere depending on how you want to do the math in the 20% plus range. So, we feel good about all those tradeoffs.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: So, maybe focusing on the revenue side of maybe where the benefits might reside from tax reform. I guess, when we look at your guidance range, are you expecting any benefit as it relates to the macro, given the tax reform benefits to consumers and corporations? And I guess, when you talk to your customers, at least on the corporate side, is there an expectation that they\u2019d invest some more towards expenses? And then, I guess, when we think about the return that you\u2019re generating and the fact that your competitors also get this benefit, are you making any assumption that some of the upside gets competed away?\nJeff Campbell: Okay. I\u2019m also taking notes\u2026\nSanjay Sakhrani: I\u2019m sorry.\nJeff Campbell: That\u2019s okay. So, a couple of comments. I think the reality of the way we do our planning process Sanjay is, as you know, we don\u2019t try to be macro economic forecasters. But there is also a little bit of lag. So, we sort of built our plan over the last few months based on a view of the economy probably as it existed prior to the passage of the tax bill. So, mechanically, the reality is, we have not built into our plan any expectation that there is a stronger economy in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world for that matter than what people thought prior to the passage of tax reform. So to the extent that tax reform does help the economy and we certainly believe along the long run. What that means for 2018 is probably a little secure, that will clearly be a good thing for us. And look, we ended Q4, I will say, with a little bit more momentum on the revenue side than we probably had originally anticipated. So, I think all of that bodes pretty well. I also think, it is interesting to look at -- and one quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but it is interesting, if you look at our large, global corporate customers, that\u2019s a segment that for some time -- now, we\u2019ve pointed out is not a growth segment. Most corporations like us are trying to control T&E spending because this is more T&E oriented. But actually, it grew 6% this quarter, which is the highest growth rate we\u2019ve had in a while. And if you dig through the tables, you see -- in our earnings release, you\u2019ll see that for the company T&E spending sequentially strengthened a little bit. And that as I said a quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but it\u2019s an interesting data point, if you think about a little bit more confidence in the economy and a little bit more of plan to spend. So, it\u2019s upside to extent the economy strengthens, because of the Tax Act, and we\u2019ll have to see what happens. In terms of the competitive environment, I guess, look, I can speak for our view, Sanjay, which is we have looked at the implications of the Tax Act and we said we should do something for employers, which we did. We have to reset our baseline by choosing to invest up to $200 million more in customer-facing growth initiatives this year and we\u2019ve given you clear EPS guidance for 2018. We have to now show you off that 2018 performance that as we get into 2019 and beyond, we can produce the same kind of steady EPS growth that the Company has historically been known for and that\u2019s what we\u2019re very focused on. And that means we are not at all looking to do anything other than use the lower tax rate to produce 2018 performance, a steady growth thereafter. I talked a little bit actually in response to other questions earlier about the reality for us that we always have a pool of unfunded things that are good opportunities for us to invest in but we don\u2019t. So having a little bit lower tax rate in all those models doesn\u2019t actually cause us Sanjay to think differently or to invest more, because we\u2019re still focused on short versus long-term. We\u2019re focused on producing steady earnings growth. So, look, we\u2019ll have to see where the environment goes. I will tell you today, we feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace on the consumer side, on the corporate side, in the U.S., outside the U.S. As I think for that reason about the rewards to billing ratio with some of the folks on the phone who look at as a little bit of an indicator of the competitive environment, I will tell you that my expectation sitting here today for 2018 is that ratio is actually pretty flat to 2017 because I feel good about our value propositions, they\u2019re performing really well, and we\u2019re trying to do the best we can for shareholders. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and that\u2019s how we think about it, Sanjay. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Hi. Good afternoon, Jeff. Chris Donat here. One other question on the $200 million or upto $200 million of customer-facing spending. I\u2019m just wondering what sort of timing you might expect for that, will you frontend load it or kind of have it evenly over the year? And are you factoring in what competitors may or may not do? Will that affect how much you spend if they\u2019re aggressive on things like promotion and\u2026\nJeff Campbell: So, good question. Couple of things to put this in perspective. So, our total marketing and promotional spending was over $3 billion last year. Our total spending on rewards was probably over $7 billion. And then, you\u2019ve got bunch of money we spent on card member services. So, look, $200 million I\u2019m choosing to call out, because as you think about the EPS guidance range we\u2019ve given and certainly had an impact on that EPS guidance range because this was at the margins and decisions we made at the end. And we didn\u2019t have to make it, and we could have given you a little higher EPS guidance range. On the other hand, in the context of all the customer-facing spending that we\u2019re doing on an ongoing basis and plan to do in 2018, it\u2019s a very small number and a very small increment. And that\u2019s why we would anticipate that as this spreads throughout the year, it is based on our current understanding of the competitive environment and how our value propositions play. And I don\u2019t see it as changing anything about our value propositions; I do want to come back to that, or changing anything about the level of incentives we need to put into the marketplace to attract any particular customer set. This is about there are incremental things we can do to garner more growth that we weren\u2019t previously doing. And that\u2019s really what you will see us targeted at.\nOperator: Thank you. And now, to line of Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Hey, great, thanks. Jeff, with respect to the tax side of things, I mean, the actual DTA write-down was smaller I guess than we had thought. But in aggregate, obviously, still a pretty big number. It feels like that\u2019s going to take bunch of years for that tax benefit to be recovered. So, kind of coming at the capital kind of question, a slightly different way, I mean, how should we think about what to expect post 2017 CCAR as you go into 2018, and I guess also recognizing that loan growth that you\u2019ve put on in the last year probably has higher stressed losses as well? So, may be kind of walk through that.\nJeff Campbell: So, a couple of comments I think I\u2019d make. So, when you think about our $2.6 billion charge, you\u2019re correct, the smaller piece is the $600 million piece which is the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. And as you think about that number going forward, for us, we\u2019re a pretty simple monoline business financially. And so, our net deferred tax position doesn\u2019t change that much from year-to-year, and it actually changes out pretty quickly, it\u2019s mostly driven by things like provision timing and membership rewards. So, there\u2019s not long, multiyear, complicated investments or business impacts on that. So, other than the revaluation, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to have any different impact on our regulatory capital calculations going forward than others. On the deemed repatriations, as everyone knows, one of the in some ways ironies there is you pay out that amount over eight years. And in fact, if you dig into the details, you\u2019ll see that the actual payment of the cash is backend loaded. And yes, from a regulatory capital perspective, we have to book it all upfront and that\u2019s why you have the big hit to regulatory capital upfront in those and actually no cash impact for a while. So, I think that we will use the two-quarter stoppage of the share repurchase program to very quickly get our capital ratios back into a range that all of the rating agencies, the regulators and we are comfortable with. And I think we will very quickly get on to the positive side of the one-time charge that we in return for a much lower tax rate going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good evening, Jeff. I just wanted to ask two quick questions. First, I wanted to bring to you some of the things that you talked about, Jeff. In terms of the EPS guidance, can you talk about what the two or three biggest swing factors would be that would get you from the top end of the range to the bottom end of the range, just given that the 7% does seem like the range that\u2019s wider than you\u2019ve historically given? And then, just on the renewals, the $200 million pretax impact, is that just a true-up from renewing the contracts and then that goes back down or is there another step-up beyond 2018? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me take those maybe in reverse order. So, on Marriott and Hilton, the way I would describe this is, as you commonly see in these larger cobrands where you have very long-term agreements, as they are renewed, there tends to be a step down in economics and we work over the course of the subsequent five, seven, eight years to really rebuild the economics. You\u2019ve seen that pattern several times with Delta, you\u2019ve seen it with some of the hotel partners before. And to be very clear, as I said in my remarks, you still have very attractive economics for us but not as attractive as they generally are in the very last year, what was the prior contract. There is no further step-up. So, over $200 million impact to PTI in 2018 is one of the hurdles that we have to overcome as we think about our EPS growth in 2018; it goes away in 2019. Just like our decision do a little bit of incremental investing, because of the Tax Act, it\u2019s really a one-time resetting of the baseline, and I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that same kind of increase in 2019 or beyond. That\u2019s a little bit on Marriott and Hilton. On the EPS guidance. In many ways, I think, I would go back a little bit to Sanjay\u2019s question, which is, when you look at our performance in 2017, the plan we have articulated for you this evening is really one, which is just a continuation of the momentum that we have today with the lower tax rate put on it and the impact of Marriott and Hilton, and the decision to step-up investment a little bit. So, the plan doesn\u2019t assume any particular greater strength in the economy. The plan does not necessarily assume a quicker take-up on some of the new and innovative things that we continue to do both in our proprietary product lines, as well as with cobrand partners like Delta or Marriott or Hilton. So, those are the kinds of things that I think could cause you to do a little bit better. I think the main thing that I worry about in terms of anything that could put you more towards the lower end are really the standard external factors. So, if you see a blip in the economy or if you see some sudden regulatory change in some major market for us, which I particularly have any line of sight into today, but it\u2019s those kinds of external factors that I would worry about, that would drive you more towards the lower end. I think other than that, as I said, the guidance we\u2019ve given you is just a continuation of the performance. But, you should have confidence and based on what we\u2019ve seen recently and if we get a little stronger economy and/or some of the new things we\u2019re doing take off a little quicker, that will really help us to get to the upside.\nOperator: And now to line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra. Thanks, Jeff. And my question was about NIM, you talked about NIM stabilizing. I was just wondering, how do you think about the loan yields going forward with the rate hikes? And then, also, if you could comment on the deposit betas. Have you seen anything on the competitive environment there with the deposit rates?\nJeff Campbell: So, I think, as we think about net interest yield, we have had a pretty good run over the last five or six quarters as we have evolved a little bit, our mix of customers, as we have taken some thoughtful pricing actions where we could, and as interest rates have edged up a little bit while the portion of our funding stack that comes from our personal savings program was acting with the beta of about 0.3. So, all of those things have given us a really nice sequential run. What I said in my remarks is as you think about 2018 I think our ability to sequentially keep growing the net interest yield is probably about at a plateau. Although, if you look at full year 2018 results, there will still be some year-over-year growth, because what I\u2019m telling you is we\u2019re plateauing kind of at Q4 levels. And in fact, the first part of 2017 was below that if you do a little bit of seasonal adjusting. So that\u2019s how I think about net interest yield. If you look at deposit betas, so fed\u2019s now done five rate hikes; if you look at our personal savings program, our beta to date, if you will, is about 0.35. As we have for a while for forward planning purposes, we assume a beta of 0.7, based on a lot of history. Certainly, I hope that is a very conservative assumption. And in general, we are trying to make sure we provide good returns for our accountholders but just competitive returns. And we\u2019re comfortable with the balances we have and with our ability to attract new balances. So, we\u2019ll have to see where that goes. As you know, if that data flips all the way up to 1, then interest rates start to be, as they go up, a headwind for the Company because of our charge card portfolio. If we can keep the beta a little bit below the 0.7 level, then interest rates going up ceases to be much of a headwind, and of course, the betas that we\u2019d had thus far is mostly a tailwind. So we\u2019ll have to see where all that goes. So, thank you for the question, Ashish.\nToby Willard: Kerry, we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that comes from the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Just had questions around clarifying the guidance little more. I think you exited the year with the revenue growth FX adjusted at 9%. I think you called out an additional 100 basis-point lift from the acquisition of the Hilton related receivables from Citi. But you\u2019re guiding to 7% to 8% for next year. Is it just an inherent conservatism in that or are there some specific headwinds you have in mind? And then, just to clarify the comments around the contributions to profit share. I think you indicated, you made some contributions in December but then talked about it in the context of the 2018 guidance. Is there more coming in 2018 and did you quantify that at all? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So, two good questions, Mark. First, on revenue, look, we\u2019ve put together a plan, as I said in response to an earlier question, based on the world as it existed over the last few months, not necessarily as it has existed since December 22nd when the tax act passed. So, the only two things that are at some point headwinds -- not headwinds, but start to fade a little bit from the revenue growth that you saw in Q4, two things I\u2019ve talked about for a while, which is net interest yield has I think started to hit a little bit of the plateau. It\u2019s still going to show nice year-over-year growth for the first half or so of 2018, but will probably show less year-over-year growth, as you get into the back half. So, that\u2019s a little bit of a moderation of the revenue growth rate. The second thing you\u2019ve heard me talk about for a while is at some point, the changes we made in the U.S. Platinum products way back in 2016 we\u2019ll be done lapping them. Now, we actually started to lap those in Q4, although not the fee -- increased fee in the consumer Platinum and yet we were still at 9%. So, as you heard me say earlier, look, Q4 probably came in a little stronger than we had anticipated. So, we\u2019ll have to see what all that means. I think our 7% to 8% range that we\u2019re giving you guidance for on 2018 is one we\u2019re very comfortable with that we can very confidently hit. And our job is to see if we can do any better. On the profit-sharing, let me clarify that. So, if you think about the timing of all this, we -- the decision to top up our profit-sharing is one we made in the days after passage of the Tax Act as we thought about the overall economics of the Company going forward and over the long-term, as we thought about the strength of our 2017 results and as we thought about doing something very consistent with our view that we\u2019re about the long-term, we\u2019re about the long-term for our shareholders in terms of performance, were about long-term relationships with our customers and we want to be about the long-term wellbeing of our employees. And that\u2019s why we think that doing something that we have not previously done a real top up around the world of retirement-oriented profit-sharing plans is a really good thing to do for the long-term wellbeing of our employees. That is a 2017 Q4 period expense and it would not be an expense in 2018, nor do we expect it to necessarily repeat.\nToby Willard: Great. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks everybody for joining tonight\u2019s call. We appreciate your continued interest in American Express. And Kerry, that\u2019s it for us.\nOperator: All right. Thank you.

Today's discussion will begin with Ken Chenault, Chairman and CEO; and Squeri, Vice Chairman who are joining us for the beginning of the call to make some remarks about the company's leadership transition and then Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and the Chief Financial Officer will review some key points related to the quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.\nKenneth Chenault: Thanks, Toby, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Steve and I wanted to start the call with a few words about our announcement from earlier this afternoon. As you'll see from the results, we are completing a two-year turnaround ahead of plan and getting ready to start a new chapter. Given the progress we're making, I thought this was the right time to begin the leadership transition and I'm very pleased to report that the Board has elected Steve to be Chairman and CEO effective February 1st of next year which will coincide with my retirement. It has been a great honor to lead American Express and I've treasured every day of my 37-year career. It's been a journey that spanned profound changes in the world of business, the payments industry and the global economy. Against that background we continued the long tradition of reinvention that has characterized American Express since its founding more than a century and a half ago. We shifted our business from a narrow travel and entertainment focused to one that accommodates the everyday spending of our card members. We created one of the world's largest loyalty programs and membership rewards. We built a global network of bank partners. We transformed our marketing, card acquisition, servicing and risk management capabilities for the digital age. We formed groundbreaking partnerships with a new generation of technology platform. We launched countless new and innovative products and services, built long-term relationships with millions of customers and merchants around the world and elevated our reputation as the gold standard for customer service. We've navigated through the tragedy of 9/11, the disruption of natural disasters, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and attacks on our business model and we've come out stronger every time. It's been an absolutely amazing time and I'm delighted that I will be handing over the reins to someone who has played an important role in shaping the company that we are today. Steve knows the business and the brand. He knows the marketplace. He is an excellent strategist, a strong leader and a great partner. We've been moving the company forward in a very competitive environment and Steve has been there every step of the way. I feel very good about how we are positioned for the next several years. Now Jeff is going to speak to our current results in a few minutes, but I thought it would be helpful to offer a little bit of context on the business and on the succession process. Those of you who have been following us for a while know that we decided a few years ago to renew some cobrand relationships and in others. We knew that those decisions would involve short-term pressure on earnings and raised questions with a number of you. But given how marketplace economics were evolving we didn\u2019t want to simply stick with the status quo and tie up resources in relationships that wouldn\u2019t make economic sense over the long-term. We believe the breadth of our business model offered better opportunities. Many of you wanted to see the proof and rightly so. We focused on refashioning the business for a new competitive regulatory and digital environment. We did that by innovating and drawing on our traditional strengths, not by abandoning them. We reorganized the company along global lines of business and we build a leaner, faster, smarter culture. We accelerated our reengineering work and are on track to take $1 billion out of our expense base. We used our investment dollars to transform many of our capabilities and fund the initiatives that are driving much of the growth you see today. The products and benefits we've added over the past few years, the relationships we've strengthened and the new customers we've acquired have been showing strong returns, cards in force, built business and earnings per share are back above where they were before we began to reposition the business. For the last few quarters we've been generating strong growth across our consumer and commercial payments business here in the U.S. and in a range of international markets. You'll be hearing more about that from Jeff. But let me also offer some context on succession which is something the Board and I have been focused on since the day I became CEO. The critical phase of the process has been underway for five plus years. We considered potential candidates from both inside and outside of the company. It has been a very thorough process and involved every member of our Board. They all agreed that Steve is the best person to build on the progress that is now underway. I know many of you have spent time with Steve over the last few years and there will be many opportunities to meet with him in his new role. Before you hear from him I thought I'd offer a little personal background. Steve caught my attention early in his career back in the 1990s and we've worked closely since the start of my tenure as CEO. He had been responsible for two of our core businesses; merchant services and commercial payments. He had a background in dealing with technology including managing our Y2K transition. Technology has always been important to American Express and I believe digital innovation was going to be even more important in the years ahead. I also believe Steve was going to be more important in the years ahead. So I asked him to head up our technologies group. I told him this was all about focusing on the future and that it was a big opportunity for him and for the company. Under Steve's leadership the tech organization became the engine that drives almost everything we do today. So it worked out well for us. It worked out pretty well for Steve too. As he accomplished more and more we asked him to do more and more. That included overseeing the global service network. It included reorganizing commercial payments into one of the fastest growing businesses at American Express. It included leading the company wide effort to improve our operating efficiencies. He has been a great partner and I am delighted as someone with a large ongoing financial interest in the success of this company to turn the reins over to him.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks Ken. I'm honored and humbled that Ken and the Board of Directors have asked me to be the next chairman and CEO of the American Express Company. I've been privileged to work here for over 32 years and through it all I have been constantly reminded how great and truly special this company is. Ken Chenault is one of the most respected business leaders in the world. Working for him for the past 13 years has been an incredible learning experience for me and I plan to draw on that experience as I move forward. When I look ahead I'm very excited about where we are and what our future holds. We're coming out of a period of transition and moving into a period of growth with tremendous momentum across our businesses. We have a strong leadership team that has instilled a sense of purpose and collaboration across the company. We have talented and engage people in every business all around the world who are resilient, creative and focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. Of course there are challenges to face including fierce competition, rapid changes brought about by technological advances and regulatory pressures. However, I've never felt better about our ability to take on those challenges. Our underlying fundamentals, our brand, and our business model is strong and we have no shortage of growth opportunities. Our next chapter will be about building on the momentum we have generated with a special focus on innovation, expanding our core product offerings, enhancing our brand and our customer relationships and partnering with others to stay ahead of the curve in the evolving payments industry. We will continue pursuing many of our current strategies that show great growth potential and will look for new avenues of growth that can help us extend our leadership position for the long-term. I want to build on what Ken has accomplished without forgetting that the status quo as he often says doesn't cut it in a fast-changing and competitive environment. I'm looking forward to spending time with many of you in my new role. For now, I want to give you a sense of the items that are front and center in my agenda and where I believe sustainable growth will come from. First we aim to strengthen our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver personalized benefits to customers through the expansion of our closed loop data advantage, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and building our premium lending portfolio through broader relationships with existing customers and industry leading risk management expertise. Second, we will look to extend our leadership in the commercial payments space globally by leveraging and investing in our unmatched global footprint and commercial capabilities and continuing our emphasis on small and midsized businesses globally by expanding our existing products and services to help them fund and grow their business. Third, we want to continue to make American Express an important part of our customers' digital lives by expanding our digital partnerships and through targeted acquisitions. Finally, we will focus on becoming the most innovative network by leveraging the fact that we are one integrated business model. We'll help merchants navigate the convergence of online and off-line commerce with cutting-edge fraud protection, marketing insights and digital connections to higher spending card members and we will offer expanded products and services to our GNS partners. Developing long-term sustainable relationships is key to our business. In every interaction we will continuously strive to provide the world's best customer experience through our best in class global service network. This is a great business model, a world-class brand and extraordinarily talented group of people. I feel very good about our capabilities, what we've accomplished and where we are today. However, the worlds of commerce and payments are not standing still. As I've learned from Ken, if great businesses don't keep moving forward they fall behind. If great brands don't evolve they lose their luster. If talented people don't innovate they lose their edge. Or said in my own words, you can't seize the future if you are stuck and are wedded to the past. I will continue to challenge our people to think what if, to rethink the possible and to innovate. Now, let me turn it back to Ken.\nKenneth Chenault: Let me close with a few short comments. First, we're completing one chapter with results that show the upside of managing this business for the moderate to long-term. Second, we're starting the next chapter from a position of strength and third, as I said earlier, it's been a great honor and privilege to lead this company. I've worked alongside some of the best and brightest talent anywhere. I've had the opportunity to partner with some of the world's most innovative and respected companies. I've been inspired by the thousands of employees around the world who deliver for our customers every day. I owe all of them my sincere thanks. There is always going to be more work to do, but I believe our best days are ahead of us. I will likely see many of you over the next few months, but for now let me say thank you for joining us and turn the call over to Jeff, who is going to discuss the results in more detail and take your questions.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Ken and Steve and thank you for getting the company to where we are today. Now as all of you might imagine, Ken and Steve have a lot of people to talk to about this news, employees, customers, partners, the media and many more. So we're going to let them go off to attend all of these discussions and Toby and I will stay here to talk to you about our latest financial results and outlook. I would start by building on what both Ken and Steve said in their remarks and you can see in our performance that our simple financial model is working. We are driving revenue growth across our diverse business, leveraging our fixed cost base to drive expense efficiencies and steadily returning capital to shareholders, all of which are combining to drive the type of steady EPS performance for which American Express has long been known.  With this as context, let's turn our attention to Slide 3 of our investor presentation where we will jump into our third quarter results. Revenue of $8.4 billion was up 9% versus the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of FX where the dollar weakened a bit and versus the prior year for the first time in a while adjusted revenue growth was 8% consistent with the adjusted revenue growth rate from Q2 2017. I'll come back to the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes, but we are pleased with our steady performance across the different customer segments we serve and the different geographies in which we operate. Net income grew 19% in the quarter while earnings per share was $1.50 up 25% from the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to steadily buybacks shares. Looking at the income statement many of you will have noted that we had an unusually low tax rate of roughly 26% this quarter. The lower tax rate results primarily from the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current quarter as well as an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. In the quarter we also incurred discrete charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition business, our U.S. prepaid business and the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. I'll provide a bit more detail on these later in my remarks, but the aggregate impact of these discrete charges equates to approximately $0.12 of earnings per share. So looking at both the lower tax rate and these discrete charges together the net impact to EPS is minimal and we believe the third quarter EPS of $1.50 is a good indicator of the underlying core performance of the business. These results brought our return on equity for the 12 months ending in September to 23%. This ROE performance is below our historical performance primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced last year in 2016. If you simply look at our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back towards our historical level as we end the year. Moving now to our metrics starting with billed business performance trends which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Worldwide FX adjusted Billings grew 8% in the quarter versus the prior year consistent with the adjusted growth rate over the last few quarters. And when we look at the segment view on Slide 5 you see consistent performance across the segments this quarter. Moving to Slide 6, we have added view of billings growth bringing together several ways we have talked about our broad ranging growth opportunities in recent years. Before we get into the details, let me remind you that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size representing 40% and 43% of billings respectively. Global Network Services makes up the remaining 17% of billings. Within the global commercial segment the first two bars represent customers who are small and midsized enterprises or SMEs defined as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues. We have consistently seen strong growth of SMEs and this continued in the third quarter. U.S. SME billings grew at 10% in the third quarter while international SME which has been one of our highest growth areas recently was even more robust with FX adjusted growth of 15%. The large and global customer segment grew at 5% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter up modestly from prior quarters. This customer group represents just 10% of our overall billings but is critical from a scale and relevance perspective, although we expect this segment to show more modest growth rates. Within global consumer the U.S. represents around 31% of the company's billings and is growing at 7%. Although the U.S. consumer premium space remains competitive, we are seeing strong results in our U.S. consumer platinum franchise. U.S. consumer platinum volumes and the card member numbers continue to be at record levels since we rolled out new features and benefits starting in Q4 last year. International consumer is up 13% on an FX adjusted basis driven by our operations in countries such as Japan, the UK and Australia all of which are up 18% to 19% adjusted for FX. Keep in mind that these volumes represent our proprietary cards with a closed loop model enables us to offer strong value propositions that are driving billings moment. Finally, FX adjusted billings growth for our network business was 4% a modest slow down from last quarter and in line with our expectations. As we've said before with evolving regulations in Europe and Australia, we expect network volumes in those geographies to decline over time. As we adapt to these new regulations, we would expect our proprietary international billings to grow faster the network partner billings. Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies. Although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition in the U.S. we are particularly excited about the opportunities we have in high growth areas like SME and international consumer which reflect the diversity of our business model. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7, our loan growth accelerated to 14% on a reported basis and to 13% on an FX adjusted basis. Once again more than 50% of the new loans added to our portfolio are coming from existing customers this quarter in line with the strategy we first laid out in early 2016. Before we get into our lending metrics, I thought it would be helpful to take a step back and review our overall lending strategy which as a reminder drives just a modest portion of our overall revenues with net interest income coming in at 20% of our total Q3 revenues. Over the last several years and in particular with the portfolio sales last year, the mix of our loan book has changed with cobrand card loans representing a smaller portion of the portfolio and AMEX branded card loans making up a greater portion of the portfolio. This shift in our portfolio leads to higher yields and as we have said before also higher lost rates. Taken together this generates attractive lending economics and you see the individual dynamics playing out across both our yield and lending credit metrics. For example, on the right side of Slide 07, you can see net interest yield increased again sequentially to 10.7%. The shift in the portfolio I just described is one of the drivers of this steady sequential increase along with a few other factors we mentioned last quarter, including a shift in the mix of revolving loans towards higher APR\u2019s including having a smaller portion at introductory rates, pricing actions taking in recent quarters, and benchmark interest rates increasing more than our overall funding costs. We are pleased with our progress here, though at some point we expect net interest margin to stabilize and as a result we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels. Turning next to credit metrics, on Slide 08 you see the upward trend as expected consistent with the same shift in the portfolio I just described. The worldwide lending write off rate was 1.8% for the quarter. Let me remind you that if you compare it to last year, the write off rate in Q3, 2016 was slightly elevated due to Costco loans that were not sold as part of the portfolio sale. In the third quarter the delinquency rate was 1.3% in line with our expectations and again higher than the prior year due primarily to the mix shift in the loan portfolio. Moving to Slide 9 provision expense for the quarter is $769 million and you can clearly see that we continue to build reserves to account for the growth in loans which has exceeded our expectations as well as the related seasoning in our loan portfolio and the mix shift towards AMEX branded products that I just discussed. A small part of the reserve build also relates to the hurricanes which we estimated at around $20 million in the quarter. This does include an estimate for Puerto Rico where we have a more limited amount of information available. We are of course doing many things to support our card members and merchants and we'll closely monitor the situation in the coming months. Looking forward, we continue to expect provision to grow at a higher rate than loans as we progress on our lending strategy. So I would expect the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 to move down towards the average for the full year. We feel good about the trade off between risk in the portfolio, profitability and growth and believe we have a long runway to grow our share of our customers' borrowing behaviours. Turning to our revenue performance, on Slide 10 FX adjusted revenue was up 8%. We are pleased with another quarter of strong revenue growth coming from a broad range of diverse business opportunities. Looking now at the components of revenue on Slide 11, first discount revenue was up 6% driven by the strong growth in billed business. Net card fees growth was 5%. If you look back to the third quarter last year we had a small non-recurring benefit that we are growing over this quarter. Considering this, our growth this quarter remains consistent with our recent trends. This quarter also had a very small impact from the platinum fee increase for existing U.S. consumer card members since the results would only show a one month impact for card members whose anniversary date is in September. While it is still early we are pleased to see strong card member engagement, acquisition and renewal trends with the refreshed U.S. consumer platinum value proposition. Other fees and commissions grew 11% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 10%. The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by prior year revenue from a small business we sold in Q4 of last year. Net interest income grew by 26% driven by the higher net interest yield, we discussed earlier and higher adjusted loan balances. Turning to discount rate, on Slide 12 the reported discount rate was 2.42% down five basis points from the prior year and the ratio of discount revenue to billed business was 1.76% down four basis points from last year. You will remember the right side of Slide 12 from our Investor Day this March where we talked about the factors driving erosion in our discount rate. The biggest drivers of erosion in the third quarter were merchant specific negotiations across the globe and our OptBlue efforts in the U.S. consistent with what we described at the Investor Day in March. In addition to the drivers we described in March, we did see a slightly larger than expected impact from mix in part due to strong growth outside the U.S. Turning now to expenses on Slide 13, performance varied across the lines and I'll discuss changes to the marketing and promotion rewards and card member services expenses when I come back to spending on card member engagement in just a minute. But first let me cover operating expenses. Total operating expenses were flat to the prior year; however, as I mentioned earlier, there were discrete charges impacting operating expense both this year and last year. In Q3, \u201916 we incurred a restructuring charge related to our initiatives to remove $1 billion from our cost base. In Q3, \u201917 we took discrete charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition business and our U.S. prepaid business. In the U.S. loyalty business, you may have recently seen announcement from certain founding partners of Plenti regarding their future loyalty plans. Given these changes, we are in confidential discussions with the few remaining Plenti sponsors regarding the future of the program. As a result of these partner announcements and the evolving state of the U.S. program, we have taken an impairment charge and a related restructuring charge for the U.S. loyalty coalition business this quarter. Before moving on, I would remind you that we run a similar program Payback in five other countries with a particularly well established long running program in Germany. In the U.S. prepaid business, the charges were related to the recently announced distribution agreement with Inca [ph]. Total operating expenses adjusted for these discrete charges in both years declined by 4% consistent with the year-over-year change on an adjusted basis that we saw in Q2. We are making solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we have previously mentioned, given our revenue performance and accelerated progress on our cost savings initiatives, we have taken the opportunity to selectively reinvest into areas of the business that we believe will help drive continued revenue growth going forward. Finally on Slide 13 as I previously discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% down from 34% a year ago due primarily to the realization of certain foreign tax credits in the current year and an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of earnings. Going forward, we estimate our ongoing tax rate will be approximately 32% given the changes to our geographic mix of earnings. Of course the rate in any given period can be further impacted by discrete tax items as we saw in Q3. Moving to the summary of our card member engagement spending on Slide 14, total engagement spending in Q3 was $3.1 billion flat sequentially and up 11% versus the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending M&P was down 12% versus Q3 \u201916. As a reminder, we expect marketing and promotion to be down significantly for the full year relative to 2016 as we realize efficiencies in our marketing spend and move beyond the unique investment opportunities we had in the second half of 2016. I would point out that given our overall strong financial performance year-to-date, we have chosen to selectively reinvest into growth opportunities for the medium to long term. As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good progress in attracting new customers. In the quarter, we added 2.6 million new proprietary customers globally. In our global consumer business over two thirds of new customer acquisition came through digital channels and over 35% of new customers were Millennials. Rewards expense increased 21% in Q3 while proprietary billings grew by 9% versus last year. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost proprietary billings of 84 basis points which is up from the prior year, but down two basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. platinum products that we implemented in Q4 \u201916 as well as strong growth in our Delta cobrand portfolio. Cost of card member services in the quarter increased 31% reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and cobrand benefits such as first bag free on Delta as well as usage of the new Uber benefit on platinum. This remains an area where we offer differentiated benefits and we plan to continue to invest in Card Member Services. Turning now to of capital in Slide 15, we continue to be pleased with our ability to return excess capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. We've returned 97% of the capital we've generated thus far in 2017 to shareholders which has driven a 5% reduction in our average shares outstanding versus the prior year. The third quarter common equity Tier 1 capital ratio moved down sequentially to 11.9% in line with our expectations and driven by growth in the balance sheet and the fact that we've returned 115% of the capital generated this quarter. We are confident that the strength of our business model provides us with the ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong capital ratios in accordance with the annual CCAR review. To summarize, over the past few years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term. We are seeing the payoff in our 2017 results with the strong and consistent performance over the first three quarters. Given these strong results and where we are in the year, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90. we are pleased to be able to both raise our earnings expectations while also funding some incremental investments aimed at driving moderate to long term results. It has long been our practice to balance the financial commitments we have in the short term which we take very seriously with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term. As we go forward, we are focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth, building upon the range of growth opportunities that we see across our diverse customer segments and geographies. With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A.\nToby Willard: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions for Jeff on the quarter's results. Cathy?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good results and congratulations to Stephen and Ken, if they catch the replay or read the transcript. Jeff, I wanted to make sure I understood your comments on the provision. It sounds like this quarter's elevated levels were related to a little bit of an expectation of higher charge offs in the future as you expect the provision to come down next quarter in terms of the growth rate. Can you just help us think about, where you see the net charge off rate going over the next 12 months?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, so thank you Sanjay for the question and a couple of comments. First, I'd remind everyone that I've often said there's a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter in the provision, so I encourage people to think a little bit about the longer term trends. If you look at year-to-date the provisions are up 37% loans are up 14% and as I said I would expect the year-over-year increase provision to look more like that year-to-date number in Q4. Next thing I'd say is, remember there's a real tie here if you think about this shift that has occurred in our loan portfolio between the yields, the write off rates and so one of the inflection points in our growth rates was around 18 to 24 months ago and we were very focused on all the changes occurring as we went through the transitions around our cobrand portfolios. A lot of the newer accounts that we acquired in that time are just hitting sort of a key point in the seasoning timeline 18 to 24 months and frankly that's part of what's driving yield up as they come off introductory rates and start paying off, and frankly that's also what's giving us a little visibility into what the right future expected write offs are and that's a little bit of what drove the provision up this quarter. So I think it's very important to keep those two things in mind we're getting attractive economics overall. As I think about net write-offs going forward, I think Sanjay if you think back we in early \u201916 seeing all the changes we were making began to say that we'd expect to see modest steady upward drift as we grow a little bit above the industry and as that drives the inevitable seasoning of the portfolio any bigger portion of the portfolio being lower tenure, that actually didn't happen much in 2016 has now begun to happen in 2017 and I really expect similar trends to continue as we get into 2018. So hopefully that helps on the provision.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Mauer with Autonomous Research. Go ahead please.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Craig.\nCraig Mauer: Yes, thanks. Hey how are you Jeff? And I'll add my congratulations if they're listening, but I doubt it.\nJeff Campbell: Yes, you are right. They will read every word of the transcript.\nCraig Mauer: So they have it okay. You're talking about reinvestment where appropriate. I was hoping you could be more specific because the read we seem to be getting on the U.S. consumer market is that there's certainly been a plateauing effect in rewards. In fact it seems like some of the most aggressive players over the last few years have been rationalizing their investment because the returns might not have been what they thought they were going to be or that consumers outsmarted them to a degree just at a time when platinum is accelerated. So are you pushing the gas pedal down further in that part of the business or are there other parts of the business that you're finding more attractive right now?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, it\u2019s an excellent question Craig and I think this really goes to the unusually broad range of both customer segments and geographies that our business encompasses. And so yes, as we have had stronger financial performance than we've expected this year we are putting a little bit to the bottom line and that's the increase in guidance and we're also putting a little bit into the M&P line and a little bit into some things that are in OpEx. And if you think about that, where the particularly high growth areas that we've seen lately, well in particular I called out in my remarks, the small and medium sized enterprise space both in the U.S. and internationally as well as the proprietary international consumer space. And so, those are - we see those as particularly good growth opportunities for us and as we have thought about where might there be a really good return over the medium to long term spending a little bit of incremental resource is those kind of areas and some of that goes into M&P and some of it also goes in OpEx. Right? When you start talking about the commercial space you're often talking about sales people who run through OpEx, you\u2019re talking about how we use our call centers to help drive more volumes that time and that runs through OpEx, so it's a mixture. But we are as you would expect being very thoughtful about putting incremental dollars only in those places where we think there are particularly good returns for us right now and where we have a unique position or unique advantage.\nCraig Mauer: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good evening, Jeff and congrats to Ken and Steve. I guess just in terms of the guidance you noted that you are raising the guidance, it seems like the business momentum is strong revenue growth has remained over 8%. I guess you made some remarks about NII over time and the growth also, but can you just talk about your ability to sustain these levels of growth both top line and bottom line as we move into '18 given that you're making some incremental investments which in theory should drive revenue growth over the short and intermediate time or would you expect some more time to move more back to the interim goals of 6% top line and 10% bottom line? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Yes, so boy there's a lot there in that question and I think. Let me start with revenues and then work my way to the bottom line. We're really pleased by the 8% revenue growth that we've seen the last two quarters and we have tremendous momentum across all of our businesses just like they did last quarter. I have pointed out that at some point the tremendous sequential growth you've seen in our net interest field will start to plateau and slow down a little bit and that will have an effect of slowing the revenue growth rate a little bit. Not calling out exactly when that turn happens it sort of didn't happen this quarter, but at some point it will slow us down a little bit. Similarly in 2017 thus far you've seen a particularly nice uplift in the U.S. from both the consumer and the business platinum value proposition changes we made late last year and early this year. At some point again, you will begin to lap those, although I would remind you on a consumer platinum product that is a long lapping process because the fee increase for existing customers only went into effect beginning with customers who had their renewal dates in September, so it will actually play out over the next, the way the accounting works, the next 24 months. So those two things over time will put a little bit of downward pressure on the current momentum you have at 8%. Now you also something\u2019s next year that will go the other way, so we are really pleased with the announcement we made along with Hilton a few months ago that point we will have an expanded partnership with Hilton in 2018 and we will become the sole cobrand provider and that will certainly provide some incremental revenue opportunities for us in 2018. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that as you would expect for cobrand renewals in recent years that also comes with the margin compression we're very pleased with that opportunity. So exactly were all that comes out in 2018 in terms of revenue growth we'll give you an update on the January call, but we feel good about the momentum and those are probably the three things that at the margin to move it a little up and a little down as you get into next year. And I guess I should also point out I'm making all my comments ignoring any changes that new rev reg rules might cause which would just be geography anyway. Bottom line look I think we have a long track record that we are showing renewed vigor on this year in that our model let's us get tremendous expense leverage and the kind of spend centric model we have does not require a lot of capital support balance growth each year which lets us do lots of share repurchase and payment of dividend. So that's the model and we should consistently be able to turn good revenue growth into even better EPS growth exactly what that looks like for 2018 we'll let you know as we get into the January earnings call.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for the color, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi good evening.\nJeff Campbell: Hi Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Could we talk a little bit about the funding side, I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about deposit growth bills, it's been very strong this quarter, just wondering if you're looking to first continue that kind of growth rate or do you feel good about where your loan to deposit ratios are today and what kind of pricing, you feel you need to attract deposits and where deposit base are going over the course of next year if there's another one or two rate hikes?\nJeff Campbell: So just the level set for everyone it\u2019s for us if you think about the 100 basis points that the Fed has raised rates over the last almost two years, we\u2019ve as they have gone up, as the Fed has gone up 100 basis points we\u2019ve raised rates on our personal savings programs about 35 basis points, so that certainly has been a big positive for our results. Now I would not expect the beta if you were to remain at 0.35 forever going forward. On many occasions in these calls, I have talked about a 0.7 beta over the longer term that we use in a lot of our modelling. Obviously, you will have to see exactly where the industry grows, our goal would remain competitive. In terms of balances, for the last couple of years Betsy, we've said we're kind of comfortable where we were because we want to remain very active in both the asset backed securities market as well as the unsecured market and being active in all three markets is an important part of our funding strategy. I would say as we get into the latter part of 2018 and beyond, I would expect to see us growing personal savings again at levels that we haven't in a number of the years. And so that\u2019s not something you'll see next quarter or early 2018 but I would say over the course of the next 12 to 18 months you will see some significant growth there exactly how much will be a little bit of a function of where the rate environment goes both in terms of the base level of what the Fed does as well as what the competitive market does for these kinds of online accounts.\nBetsy Graseck: You are trying to get the loan to deposit ratio up perhaps is that the reason for that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the way we really think about it Betsy is I come back to given our mix of business, we probably think of it less as a loan to deposit ratio and we think of - we want a funding strategy that creates a balance of being diversified across different sources in different markets so that from a security and installment perspective no matter what happens in the capital markets, we have good access to capital and we want to do that while also being efficient about funding our diverse business model. And I think what people forget sometimes is because we have a big international business, because we have a corporate card business, our funding structure requires that we access different sources of funding in different places that our funding is not all fundable. So that\u2019s really how we approach it and what I say is the personal savings rate or number which has been in the $30 billion number for a while range that is a number that I would expect to go up over the next 12 to 24 months.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Thank you. Congratulations to both Ken and Steve. So Jeff on that note, how do you make sure that a big management change like this doesn't have any impact on negotiations around let's say the Starwood deal?\nJeff Campbell: Well there's probably two questions there. First, gosh I'm going to go back to the thing Ken and Steve said. Steve's story has worked hand in hand with Ken now for 32 years and has been intimately involved in every change that we've made in particular over the last couple of years. So I don't think we missed a beat on any aspect of running the business. As I say that I also think it's important to remind you Steve\u2019s words that we fully understand though that doesn't mean you don't constantly have to change, you can't stand still. So I feel really good about all that. In terms of Marriott and SPG, look we said for a long time that there are three possible outcomes here. Right? Marriott chooses to keep two cobrand partners they go with the other cobrand partner or they go with us. I will acknowledge we are the smaller of the two partners, on the other hand Marriott has made a lot of public statements here about the fact that they want to bring the two programs together next year, that our contract doesn't expire until 2020, the other cobrand bank, their contract expires next year. So we have been working really hard to demonstrate the tremendous value that the range of travel assets we have consumer travel agencies, business travel agency a huge membership reward program, a premium oriented customer base, we think goes a really tremendous assets when you're talking about a travel cobrand we think they've been a really important part of what has made SPG a really powerful program and I think Marriott is very focused on making sure they keep the loyalty and the engagement of all those SPG card members and we would love to be a part of it. So still we will have to see where it goes but I don't think we'll miss a beat there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes thanks. Jeff when I studied your conference last month it sounded like you saw the NIM was already kind of at a level where it might have plateaued, yet you had another big step up this quarter and it also sounds like you are not necessarily closing the door of an ocean that could have a little bit more upside there. First I just wanted to get your reaction, am I recalling that correctly and if so what if anything has kind of changed the outlook and kind of what specifically really was the driver of the strength of this quarter?\nJeff Campbell: Well you are completely accurately recalling my comments, the public comments from your conference a little bit ago. I think the important word here which they tried to replicate in my remarks earlier this afternoon are that at some point obviously you can't raise your net interest yield forever. At some point it has to plateau now we\u2019re working hard to try to continue to do smart things that are consistent with building long term customer engagement and loyalty that will continue to drive net interest yield up, but at some point it will plateau, now we're wI\u2019m not calling exactly when that happens and it certainly did not happened this quarter and we're really pleased with the momentum we have.\nMark DeVries: Okay, thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you, we'll go next to Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Go ahead please.\nChris Brendler: Hi thanks, good evening and thanks or taking my question. Jeff, I wanted to talk to you or ask about discount revenue and the trajectory there, if I look at discount revenue net of rewards it is actually still shrinking about 3% and 5% including the services line. And I know we faced some challenges at Costco but we\u2019re kind of beyond that and you've got some renegotiations in Europe and other things that are weighing on discount rate, but is that a lot and it should start to grow again as we go forward because and I would think that's something that would be a focus of yours, instead of growing the discount revenue net of rewards is kind of my area of question? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, believe me it is a focus and yes, I don't know the exact math, you just yes directionally you're correct, the thing you need to remember we made a very conscious decision late last year, early this year to make some significant value proposition enhancements in the U.S. in both the business platinum card and the consumer platinum card and those are both very substantial and material franchises for us. So it worked tremendously well, we've really exceeded our own expectations even in terms of card member engagement and new card member acquisition as well as continued really de minimis attrition rates. Until you are done lapping that increase in rewards cost, you get the effect you just described on discount revenue overall. So look there it is a competitive environment in all the markets we serve, but particularly competitive in the U.S. consumer space, but once you're done lapping these, you should begin to see a little different trend when you do the calculation that you just described and certainly our goal across the globe is to get that discount revenue net of rewards number growing consistently.\nChris Brendler: And I would think that would \u2013 So Jeff are there some one-time costs associated with this, I would think those rewards costs would be perpetual if you're increasing the value of the products and the value of the spending you wouldn't necessarily have an anniversary. There may be some one-time costs that you\u2026\nJeff Campbell: Yes, but when you're looking at year-over-year growth remember you have a big step-up in the rewards cost this year and a kind of what I'm going to call standard step up in discount revenue and what we would expect to see once you've done lapping that as you're still on the same somewhat similar trajectory in terms of your gross discount revenues but growing but your rewards costs don't have the huge spike in growth that they have this year. If you think about it that the in my remarks I think the numbers I called out were or its costs are up 19% well the 21% while the associated billings are up much less. So that relationship as we go into the next quarter or two will get much more aligned again and that will change the phenomenon you described.\nChris Brendler: Excellent, I'm looking forward to that, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.\nKen Bruce: Thank you, good evening and congratulations to Ken and Steve. My question really relates to reserving obviously the loss rates for American Express are quite low relative to the industry and you've kind of talked about that the increase that you're looking for. I guess I'm trying to understand kind of the reserving that you're anticipating sometimes companies use 12 months, sometimes little longer. Can you give us any kind of sense as to how you're thinking about that reserve because it looks like a very large build, no matter how you want to look at it this quarter.\nJeff Campbell: The reserving process can [indiscernible] went through in great detail and as it is both a heavily regulated process not just by the usual accounting standards you would expect but also heavily by our regulators and some what we do is very much driven by them. Look there's no question this was a big reserve build this quarter. What I keep coming back to is the when you put aside there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility and you look at this over any given couple of quarters we're trending as we would have expected. We are pleased with the loan growth we are seeing overall. The shift in portfolio mix is an important part of what is driving tremendous growth and net interest yield and that comes with some growth in the write offs and we are getting as I explained earlier to this point where A significant number of the newer accounts we brought on 18 to 24 months ago are getting to be a key part of the time line as they season and so we're building some reserves for that and that's part of what's driving the yield up as well. So there is really not a lot more to the storey. I mean, yes we certainly look at what kind of coverage we have going forward, although we've made different judgments and charts versus lends in different parts of the world. But we feel good about the reserves. We think they're conservative and we feel good about the overall economics that we're getting from our lending.\nKen Bruce: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Hi, great, thanks. I wanted to come back to Chris's question about the rewards costs and you had mentioned that it was down a couple of basis points from the second quarter in terms of the rewards costs and maybe I saw in the notes here that the ultimate redemption rate was stable. Did you discuss whether that was an impact from the cost per point or something else that's going on and how that might kind of move around going forward?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, so I you know, yes you're right most of the - there was a small sequential decline, I think what you're calling out is the ratio of the rewards costs to the billings, there's a little quarter-to-quarter volatility it\u2019s a very complex calculation that of course is not just US calculation but it involves lots of other international markets that you\u2019re doing the calculation by market. So you get a little bit of volatility quarter-to-quarter. I would not want anyone to leave the call thinking that 84 basis points is exactly what you should expect forever going forward it'll bounce up and down a few basis points each quarter. In general though, that's the range I would expect to be in given all the value propositions that we have in the marketplace today and I wouldn't point to any particular business change or anything that drove that 2 basis points sequential decline Moshe.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead please.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question and obviously congratulations to Ken and Steve both well deserved. I wanted to talk a little bit about incentives and one of the things we've seen over the last several years is there's been a distortion between I would describe rewards and loyalty and as the rewards sort of war of being it's a little bit, are you starting to see brand loyalty become more and important again and are you seeing any shift in terms of wallet share amongst your existing customers based upon that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I guess Rick, let me make a few comments and they may or may not be responsive to exactly where you're going. Certainly we believe both Ken and Steve in their remarks talked about the fact that we think we have a particularly strong brand in our customers given our long standing reputation for service attach to our brand and we take that loyalty really seriously and really value it and work very hard at it. And one of the things that we've talked about on many of these calls is that sometimes people will do a pure mathematical calculation of different products that are out there in the marketplace and say gee, American Express you can't possibly compete because let's use this simplest category because your cash back card doesn't seem to be as rich as somebody else's. And yet our response to that is often well our cash back cards are doing really good in terms of new customer acquisitions. They're growing nicely and they're producing really good economics for us. And one of the things I like to point out internally is we do believe there is value in the brand. We do believe there's value in the range of services we provide and so by gosh, we should be able to get those things valued by customers and we shouldn't have to necessarily mathematically match every other aspect of the value proposition that\u2019s some of our competitors put in the marketplace. So I think frankly Rick we see that longstanding view we have, our longstanding experience, this proves that brand does matter and loyalty does matter we work really hard at doing things that build upon that. If you think about the platinum refreshes that we've done there, very much focused on some of the aspects, the experiential aspects of the product that we think are more difficult for others to replicate in build upon some of our reputation. So that\u2019s what we're trying to do every day. We think is what we've historically done and we think it gives us some unique advantages that are not easy for others to replicate.\nRick Shane: Jeff, look I agree with that, and I'm specifically curious if you're seen as that sort of distortion normalizes specifically any pick up in wallets I know that's been a big focus for you guys?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, well, you know, gosh in a company with over $100 million card members major trends evolve slowly. Yes we're very focused on attracting more wallet share. We're also in our consumer business very focused on attracting more borrowing share and so we have clearly been making huge strides for the last several years and driving more borrowing share in terms of our card members wallets and spending sure you kind of have to look at it by market by commercial versus consumer. I often say Rick, our goal is to ultimately maximize our financial returns and to maximize our revenue share and we pay attention to our wallet share. We pay attention to our share of billings. We pay attention to our share of lending and certainly in the U.S. consumer space we're growing share like crazy in our share of lending. But we're not always trying to maximize every one of those if we don't think it's economic. So we feel good about our revenue performance and we think it's building on a good economics for us so.\nRick Shane: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Rick. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead please.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and congratulations to Ken and Steve, not a big surprise I guess after my last conversation with you guys. But just on page six, very helpful just on going through that. I'd just like little more color on the growth in your presentation there looking at the SME, U.S. SME, international SME, international consumer we have some pretty high growth rates and then the deceleration in Global Network Services. Is that - are we - is there a multiyear opportunity in each of these that are much larger that I mean I think the opportunity seemed to be very large, but do we have a long way to go, long runway in the growth of these higher growth segments and should we expect GNS to continue become less important?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, so couple comments. Yes, we see tremendous growth opportunities that will last a very, very long time in the SME space because the point we try to make over and over and over to people as far as you know is that in that space we\u2019re often competing against just trying to get small and mid-sized enterprises to put more of their payment needs onto the card and it's frankly less about the competition, less about some of the highly competitive rewards competition we face elsewhere and the growth rates you\u2019ve seen in both the U.S. and international SME segments have been very high for some number of years. They're driven by our continual ability to work with small and mid-sized enterprises to drive more spend onto the card and we think despite that we've only captured a small fraction of their spend and we can keep at this for years. Similarly when you go outside the U.S., but because of evolving regulation in Europe, in Australia for some time let's see exactly how long it takes because there is a little bit of a wind down of the network business in those two parts of the world. It\u2019s still growing really nicely everywhere else and it's still globally an important part of the American Express network. Right? So I don't want anyone to walk away from this call thinking it's a less important part of our company, it\u2019s really important to the global network. You're just going to see modest overall growth rates because of the step down in Europe and Australia. That very step down though in the evolving regulatory climate is part of what's helping fuel some tremendous growth rates in places like the U.K. and Australia in our proprietary card business where of course we also get a much greater share of the overall economics. So that\u2019s a pretty good trade for us.\nBob Napoli: That international consumer segment as well Jeff, longer term what you know has that had the same growth opportunities as SME? A - Jeff Campbell Absolutely, absolutely because remember outside the U.S., our consumer businesses are still in what I often call Bob an earlier stage of growth. We're growing faster than the market in every of the major countries that we do business in with the exception of Canada. And yes, we still have pretty small market shares, we have value propositions that are very difficult for others to match, we're very bullish about that business.\nBob Napoli: Great, I appreciate your comments, thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you, Bob.\nToby Willard: Hi Cathy, we have time for just one more question, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.\nDavid Togut: Thanks Jeff and congrats to Steve and Ken as well. I\u2019m curious for your thoughts about any additional cost takeout you might have in 2018 in addition to the $1 billion run rate you expect to hit at the end of this year?\nJeff Campbell: So look, we feel really good about the hard work that it's been over the last two years to take yet another billion dollars out of the run rate of the company and we're on track, we\u2019ll get it. when you go beyond that David, what I always say is what you can always take cost out of the company, it\u2019s not always prudent though and I think when you go beyond 2017, the way to think about it is in a world where we're seeing the kind of revenue growth now we can support that and we will support that with very little growth in operating expenses and so that\u2019s a tremendous ongoing story of operating leverage. For now, I think saying that we're going to take out another billion dollars would probably not be prudent and we would lose more revenue than we would gain. But steady operating leverage, you should absolutely expect from us.\nDavid Togut: Understood, thank you very much.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you.\nToby Willard: Thank you everybody for joining tonight's call and thanks for your continued interest in American Express. Cathy, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today, thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to quarter's results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published our second quarter results and with our earnings per share for Q2 at a $1.47, and with adjusted revenue growth for 2Q of 8%. We believe that our results continue to reflect solid progress against our priorities, laid out again on Slide 2, accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base. Since early 2015, we have made many changes to the company and have been investing in a broad set of growth opportunities generated by our unique business model. As we have made these changes, we have always thought to balance the short, medium and long term. We are certainly encouraged by our current revenue performance and the near term payoff we are getting from our actions. But to be clear, we are making decisions and generating sustainable revenue growth and we've remained focused for the years beyond 2017 on the 6% revenue growth scenario that we shared at our Investor Day in March. In addition, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs. Our efforts across these areas are driving the simple model we have shared over the last couple of years. We have a diverse range in growth businesses as a business model that provides steady operating leverage plus a balance sheet that shows tremendous capital strength all of which contribute to steady EPS growth. Now, I know our numbers have been difficult to interpret over the past two years of repositioning the company, but Q2 does mark the end of the need for the quarterly adjustments we have sharing with your comparison purposes since the beginning of 2016. I know we are all looking forward to next quarter on that front. Indeed more broadly, in many ways the end of the first half 2017 is a milestone for us as we complete the transition from repositioning the company and managing the related volatility to executing plans focused again on delivering steady revenue and earnings growth. Of course the environment we operate in is challenging but we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively across our diverse customer segments and geographies. With that let me turn to the detailed results starting with the summary financial performance on Slide 3. Revenue of $8.3 billion for the second quarter increased 1% versus the prior year, reflecting primarily higher year-over-year net interest income. Excluding Costco-related revenues from the prior year and the impact of FX, adjusted revenue growth was 8%. The second quarter also included growth in provision in rewards expense above the growth in loans and billings respectively as we would have expected, both of which I will come back to in a few minutes. Net income of $1.3 billion was down 33% versus the second quarter of 2016 largely due to the $1.1 billion gain recorded last year upon the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio. Earnings per share of a $1.47 reflects our net income performance and also the benefits of our strong capital position. Over the last four quarters, we have returned $3.2 billion of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, which is resulted in a 5% reduction in average shares. These results brought our ROE for the 12 months ended in June to 22%. This ROE performance is below our recent performance of approximately 25%, primarily due to the uneven quarterly earnings we experienced in 2016. If you simply look at the math of our expected earnings range for the full year 2017 and our equity position, our ROE should trend back towards our recent performance level as we progress through the year. So let me move to our metrics starting with billed business performance trends, which you see several different views up on Slides 4 through 7. Worldwide FX adjusted billing grew 1% in the quarter versus the prior year. As we move to Slide 5, you can see the Q2 billings growth adjusted for both the impact of Costco and changes in foreign exchange rates remained consistent with Q1 at 8%. We are encouraged by the continued momentum in billing this quarter, which reflects broad based growth across our diverse segments and geographies, with adjusted U.S. billings steady at 6% and international billings growing the low double-digits. Turning to the segment perspective, in GCS, which grew at 5% year-over-year consistent with Q1, we continue to see healthy performance in the small business and middle market client segments, which I'll refer to as SMEs in my remarks. Just to remind you, at our Investor Day, we defined SMEs as clients with less than $300 million in annual revenues. Adjusted volumes from our SME client segment in the U.S. grew in the low double-digits in the quarter. And outside the U.S., SME client volume grew in the mid-teens. In the large and global GCS client segment, volumes were up a bit as compared to last year though. As we've said for a while now, we expect the large and global client segment to remain slower growth rates as corporations look to manage their travel and entertainment expenses. In addition, we do not yet see any significant complexion point in macroeconomic trends that has caused a shift in spending patterns for these large and global customers. In the international consumer and network services segment, the FX adjusted billings growth rate was 8% in line with the previous quarter. Looking at the two parts of the segment, FX adjusted volume from proprietary cards grew at 12%, up from an 11% in Q1, reflecting continued strength in several international markets. In GNS, the FX adjusted growth was 5% in Q2, down modestly versus the prior quarter, primarily due to China as well as Australia and the EU, which were impacted by changes related to regulation. Moving to international in total on Slide 7, our billings growth rate is down slightly sequentially, but remained healthy with double digit growth in FX adjusted terms. As we look our few key markets for example, we see continue double-digit FX adjusted growth in the UK up 15%, Mexico up 12%, and Japan up 17%. While we have been showing strong growth across international, the regulatory environment in markets like Europe, Australia and China will continue to evolve and we will continue to adopt our business model as the regulatory environment unfolds. Stepping back, we are pleased with the continued strength of our adjusted billings growth rate. The momentum in the first half of the year reflects the investments we have made in a verity of growth opportunities over the last couple of years. Although we face intense competition in the U.S. and the regulatory environment in uncertain in many markets around the world, we've remained focused on driving more volume under our network, we feel good about the diversity of our billings growth. Turning to our worldwide lending performance now on Slide 8. Our total loans were up 11% versus the prior year and are solid quarterly performance. We continue to steady grow loans faster than the industry as we capture the particular opportunity we have to growth loans with existing customers while also adding new customers. As we look forward, we believe we have a long runway for growth given our existing customer opportunities, while maintaining best in class credit performance. Looking at the right hand side of the slide, you can see that net interest yield is again up significantly year-over-year. The improvement in yield is driven by a number of factors, including a shift in mix to non-cobrand customers who are more likely to revolve, having fewer revolving loans at introductory rates, specific pricing actions taken in recent quarters and a benefit from increasing in benchmark interest rates without a similar increased in our overall funding cost. As a quick reminder, our online deposit program personal savings is a little over $30 billion in size. In our 10-K interest rates sensitivity analysis, we assume that as benchmark rates increase, our personal savings rate increases with a deposit data of 1. However, if you look over the last couple of years, the prime rates has increased by a 100 basis points, while our own personal savings rate has only increased by 25 basis point. Now that change to our rate has come in just a last couple of months and we will continue to adjust our deposit funding rates to stay competitive in the deposit markets. In general though, the personal savings program continues to be a very cost effective and attractive source for us. Looking out to the balance of the year, if you consider the list I just went through, many of these drivers will persist, however the year-over-year change in the yield should not be as pronounced as we move through the coming quarters. Before turning to provision expense, let me tough on our credit metrics on Slide 9. Again this quarter, delinquency and loss metrics in our portfolio were best in class. In the worldwide loan portfolio, you can see that the delinquency rate was consistent with Q1 and up modestly versus the prior year. Loss rates as we would have expected also continue to be modestly higher year-over-year. Going forward, we continue to expect loss rates to increase gradually due to the seasoning of new accounts and a shift towards non-cobrand products, which have slightly higher loss rates but also generate greater yields. As loss rates gradually move higher and loans continue to grow, the growth rate in provision will exceed the growth rate of loans, which is you can on Slide 10 was in fact the case for Q2 as provision increased by 26%, while loans grew by 11%. Turning into our revenue performance on Slide 11. FX adjusted revenues were up 1% and revenue growth adjusted for both Costco and FX increased by 8%. Clearly, we are pleased with another quarter of accelerating adjusted revenue growth. And in particular with the broad based contribution to that growth from our diverse business segments. If you take a step back, we have taken clear and different actions across those diverse segments to drive growth. Let me take you back here for a second to Slide 12, which I first shared in our Investor Day in March. On this slide, I talked about the growth opportunities we have across our different segments and I stressed that we have made specific changes in the way we operate to better seize these opportunities. As I look at our results this quarter and in indeed over the last several quarters, I see progress against each of these growth opportunities as we realize the returns on the changes and investments we have been making. Today, we have a consumer segment generating strong internationally and in the U.S. where we have strengthened our product offerings in the premium sector. And lending efforts that have broadened our card member relationships and successfully balanced growth, the strong credit quality and industry leading presence with SMEs who use our cards for an expanding portion of their payments needs, a larger merchant network that accommodates a greater share of our card member spending, a card acquisition engine that has successfully been redesigned for digital age and the more agile technology infrastructure that brings customized products and services market more quickly and efficiently. All of these are driving our performance as we come back now to the components of revenue on Slide 13. First, discount revenue was flat year-over-year and grew by 7% on an adjusted basis. The discount rate in Q2 was 2.44%, up 1 basis point for the prior year due to lower rate volumes coming off the network. As we stated in Investor Day, once we move to the second half of 2017, you will see the discount rate trend shift back to down year-over-year due to the ongoing impact of merchant negotiations particularly in a regulated markets like Australia and Europe and the continued rollout of OptBlue. Of course as always, the mix of our billings across industries and geographies will also impact the rate year-over-year as we go forward. I know many of you also focused on the ratio of discount revenue to build business, which in addition to the reported discount rate also includes the impact of certain contra revenue items and also how we account for our GNS business. In the quarter, this ratio was flat year-over-year at 1.79% as growth in corporate client incentives and co-brand partner payments and the shift in our billings mix towards GNS were offset by a year-over-year decline in cash rebate payments. Net card fees grew by 8% in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the U.S. Platinum and Delta portfolio as well as growth in Mexico and Japan. Given the competitive environment especially in the U.S. consumer segment, we view steady growth in card fees as indicative of our Card Members recognizing the breath and strength of the value propositions we offer on our products. In addition, I would remind you that the increased Platinum fee for existing U.S. Consumer Card Members does not start to contribute to card fee grow until September of this year. Other fees and commissions grew 7% in the second quarter while other revenues declined by 19%. The decline in other revenues was primarily driven by a contractual payment from a network services partner in the prior year second quarter and the sale of a small business in Q4 of last year. Net interest income grew by 6% and on an adjusted basis grew by 24% as the higher net interest yield I described earlier and higher adjusted loan balances combined to drive significant growth in net interest income. Turning now to expenses on Slide 14. Performance vary across the lines and I'll discuss the changes to marketing and promotion rewards in Card Member Services expenses when I come back to Card Member engagement spending in just a minute. But first our operating expenses. Total operating cost during the quarter were up 39% versus the prior year excluding from the prior year the $1.1 billion gain from the Costco co-brand portfolio sale, which was treated as a contra expense. And a $232 million restructuring charge, adjusted operating expenses were down 4%. And this marks the fourth consecutive quarter that adjusted operating expenses have declined year-over-year. We continue to make solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we are confident that we will remove $1 billion from the Company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. We are steadily executing on our plans to improve our efficiency and get costs out. This progress along with our revenue performance today is allowing us to selectively reinvest some of those savings in areas that will help drive continued revenue growth going forward. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.2% compared to 33.2% in the same period last year, reflecting both discrete items and proportionally higher earnings from lower tax rate international market than in the prior year. We now expect the full year tax rate to come in slightly below our previously stated range of 33% to 34%. Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on Slide 15, total engagement spending in Q2 was $3.1 billion or 10% higher than the prior year in the quarter and up 7% year-to-date. Looking at the components of that spending, in the first half of the year, M&P was up 1% versus 2016. As a reminder coming into 2017, we expected marketing and promotion to be down significantly from 2016 levels as we found efficiencies in our marketing spend and moved past some of the unique investment opportunities we had in 2016. And you will see that year-over-year reduction in the second half of this year. I would also remind you that consistent with our historical practice, we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities and monitor our business performance and saving initiatives and balance our financial commitments with driving long term value. As we look at the effectiveness of our marketing spend, we continue to see good traction in attracting new customers for the franchise. In the quarter, we added 2.7 million new proprietary customers globally and in our global consumer business close to two thirds of new customer acquisition came through digital channels and 35% of new customers. Rewards expense increased 9% in Q2 despite a small decline in proprietary billing volumes versus the prior year. Excluding the Costco co-brand volumes in the prior year, adjusted rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 20%, while adjusted proprietary billings grew by 6%. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost to proprietary billings of 86 basis points were roughly in line with the prior quarter. The greater year-over-year increase in rewards expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. Platinum products that we implemented at the beginning of Q4 2016, as well as continued strong growth and our Delta co-brand portfolio. Cost and Card Member Services in the quarter increased 24%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta, as well as usage of the new Uber and benefit on Platinum. We continue to believe that this is an area where we can offer differentiated benefits and we will continue to invest in Card Member Services. To focus for just a moment on U.S. Platinum, you already know we have made a series of changes to our U.S. consumer and small business platinum product offerings over the last several months both in rewards and other more experiential benefit. The yearly results from these changes look good and we are seeing both increased engagement from our existing U.S. Platinum Card Members as well as higher rates of new customer acquisition since the introduction of the new benefits. Turning now of Slide 16 in touching on capital. We continue to use our strong balance sheet to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Over the last four quarters, we have returned 94% of the capital we have generated. I think this shows the commitment we have over time to leveraging our business model and capital position to steadily create shareholder value. As you all know, we have recently received a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2017 adjusted CCAR submission. We have both increased the dividend payout for the next four quarters as well as significantly increased the share buyback versus the prior CCAR authorization. We remain confident in the strength of our business model and our ability to drive shareholder value through capital returns. Of course, we also use capital to support business building activities such as growth in our loan balances and potential M&A activity in addition to returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. Stepping back now in conclusion. Over the past several years, we've embarked on a series of initiatives to reposition the company and drive sustainable and consistent revenue and earnings growth. These efforts have been targeted at providing a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer term. Looking forward we are encouraged with the trends that we've seen in our business metrics and revenue growth. And believe that these initiatives are driving real momentum across our diverse business segments. Even though revenue performance of the first two quarters, we now expect full year adjusted revenue growth to be above the top end of the 5% to 6% range I discussed in our Investor Day in March. While this is clearly a positive development. I would remind you that our recent revenue growth is benefiting from certain drivers that are likely to stabilize somewhat in future quarters such as growth in yield and increased customer engagement particularly on the platinum card. In addition, as is our historical practice, we will continue to balance delivering earnings to the bottom line and investing for the moderate to long term. I would also say that as moved the back half of 2017, the uneven year-over-year comparisons from the last few years have discontinued partnerships, large restructuring charges and portfolio sales will be behind us. And results in the second half of this year should therefore provide a clearer picture for all of us of the progress we have made towards producing steady and consistent results. Against the backdrop of all these moving pieces and given that we are at the midpoint of the year, we are confident that we will deliver full year earnings per share between $5.60 and $5.80. With that, let me turn it back over to Toby as we move to Q&A.\nToby Willard: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Cathy?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nKen Bruce: Thank you. Good evening. One clarification if I could and it relates to card fees in some of the value prop subset already in the market. I guess you had mentioned that you get card fees they were up nicely in the quarter, but that is not benefiting from the increase in platinum card fees which is later this year, are we looking at some of the costs already being included in the expense side of the equation. Related to that, I guess I just want to make sure we understand the timing of the revenues versus expenses on that particular platform?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yeah, it's a good question Ken. So to remind everyone on the business and consumer platinum products, we made some changes in the latter part of 2016, and then on the consumer product, we offered a further range of benefit enhancements that went in at the end of the first quarter of this year. So all of the costs associated with the significantly higher Card Member engagement that those changes are driving are what you see reflected in our results can really the last two quarters and are key part of what is driving a little higher rewards cost and a little higher Card Member services costs. As I said in my remarks, on the Consumer Card where we did include a fee increase, existing card members don't actually pay that until renewals begin in September. So the increase in fee revenue will lack to your point the increase in costs, we think that's an important way to do this. So customers have a sense of what the enhanced values are at the time that they see the higher fees. As you know we have a long track record of every couple of years with all of our products doing these kinds of upgrades and changes to the value propositions, which are often accompanied by a fee increase. So we think we have a pretty thoughtful approach to this. I guess the last comment I would make is, we've not only been pleased with the increased engagement with our existing card members, but with both the business product and the consumer product, we've been very pleased with the significant increase in new card member acquisitions. And on the consumer side, those new card members of course do pay the higher fee right from day one. Totally can that helps clear up exactly what's in and not in the results so far.\nKen Bruce: Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey good evening, Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Jeff, I'm just wondering maybe two quick things, one I think in you Investor Day you talked about improving EPS each quarter throughout the year, I know there could be some timing around certain investments, but do you still feel confident in that? And then I guess just related to that you're now saying revenue growth above the high end, your tax rate is going to be lower, so I know you had mentioned selectively reinvesting, so can you just maybe talk about the decision between allowing the incremental revenue hit the bottom line versus where you may potentially reinvest some of the stronger revenue? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yeah, so there's a couple of good questions there Ryan. I think first on EPS progression, certainly we are pleased with the first half that we have had. And so I would probably not reaffirm those statements about EPS progression, the point I would make if you have the first two quarters of EPS and you have our full year guidance. So I do think it's important as I say that to point out that we're only halfway through the year. Just like everyone else, we would sort of like to see next quarter's clean comparisons before we think about an updated view on the full year. And there are some reasons that I talked about in my remarks around growth in yield at some points slowing that cause us to want to see one more quarter before we adjust what we see for the year. And to your point, we always are thinking about how we balance the financial commitments we have which we take very seriously in the short term with the opportunities we see to invest and build for the longer term. And even in the first half of the year, we have selectively chosen to spend a little bit more a couple of things in the M&P line than we had originally intended this year, because we're very pleased with revenue growth, we're very pleased with our progress on the cost reduction efforts and we could do those things while still being remaining very consistent to the earnings commitments that we've made to our shareholders. So you know we'll have to see as we get into the quarter, we're now 19 days into exactly what all that means for the rest of the year, but clearly we're off to a stronger start than we expected. We feel really good about the revenue growth and all the efforts that we have underway and we will as always balance the short term and the long term as we make decisions in the next six months.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks for taking my question.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I guess just when we think about that revenue growth for the second half, Jeff, as you look forward, you mentioned there might be some moderation, I mean is that the running expectation that you have, I mean what is the swing factor that will either sort of drive us better than what you're anticipating versus not, because we kind of know what the impact of the yield part is, if it stays constant. And then when we're thinking about spending more than what was planned, I mean where exactly do you see the opportunities, is it in some of the areas where your competitors are kind of retrenching some, and you could take back share? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: So lot of good questions here. Sanjay, sure I'll make a few comments. First, my comments about revenue growth and the 8% you see in Q2, we're really meant to point out that there's two things that in particular are helping us right now, and that's the very strong sequential growth you've seen in yields, and all of the drivers of that growth we think will sustain themselves in terms of the absolute level of yield you see today. But you know we can't keep raising prices for example forever, so there's some moderation I'd expect in the year-over-year growth in the yield going forward. Clearly, we made some significant investments and this is really the point that Ken was asking about in the first question. We made some significant investments in the U.S. on both the business platinum and the consumer platinum card and that is really driving a really nice result in terms of increased Card Member engagement. The effects of - the economics effects of that to can question well play out over a longer time period that the fee increase benefits you actually won't begin to see until you get into the latter part of the year. All that said, I would expect there is some stabilization if you will of the growth rate driven by all of those changes as we go into future quarters. So for all of those reasons Sanjay for now, as we look at the low GDP growth, low inflation environment we're in, as we look around the globe at the range of competitive and regulatory issues we face, as I go beyond 2017, we're going to drive revenue growth as much as we can, but the target that I'm trying to communicate we are still focused on is that 6% level as you get beyond 2017 for the reasons I just described. Your last question about selectively reinvesting as we look at our stronger performance. The great thing about the growth we're seeing right now is, it is very broad across almost all of our customer in geographic segments with the exception probably of the large and global corporate segment which is not as we've said for some time, particularly growing segment right now. So the modest amount of reinvestment done is spread across almost every geography and every customer segment. And sure we are always trying to be responsive to changes in the competitive environment. On the other hand, we run the company for the long term, we try to build long term customer relationships and we're a little cautious sometimes about reacting overly short term to any one particular move by competitor. So hopefully that covers the waterfront there Sanjay.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yeah, thanks. Jeff, you've indicated you still see a very long runway for growth - for loan growth that is particularly with existing customers. Can you help us think out through in a little more detail, I mean how much of the growth is coming from what you might consider lower hanging fruit and how much more challenging does that become as you know grabbing that growth as time passes?\nJeffrey Campbell: You know Mark, as you've heard a number of a say, for a while the track record we now have for several years of growing a little bit faster than the industry while still retaining best in class credit metrics. That's not a new thing. The track record is now there for several years. And despite that as you know with our consumer customers and also for our commercial customers, we capture a far smaller share of their borrowing behaviors and we do of their spending behaviors. And that gives us we think a rather unique opportunity relative to most of our competitors to tap into people we know really well, our existing customers and try to develop the right products, the right pricing, right marketing to get a little bit greater share of their borrowing behaviors. And yet despite several years of doing that when you actually just look at the math, our share of their borrowing behaviors has gone up a couple of points and in the consumer world in the U.S. for example, we still probably have double the share of a customer spend behavior that we do with their borrowing behaviors. So when you run the math out on there is just a long, long run way to continue to do all this. And now you know we grow our lending both to the existing customers and by being lot more focused on acquiring new customers who want to engage in some level of borrowing. But as you look at recent quarters, we've driven over half of our loan growth from our existing customers and it's that dynamic could makes us believe we have such a long runway to continue to grow little faster than the industry while retaining really good credit quality.\nMark DeVries: Okay, thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yeah, hi Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. So first question, I just wanted your thoughts on the new surcharging ban that was introduced in the UK that will go into effect next year. How that - how you believe surcharging has been impacting your ability to grow volumes in the UK? And then just is your charge off guidance still consistent with the 15 basis points to 25 basis points year-on-year for 2017 that you've discussed earlier? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: Craig, you obviously very timing sense, the UK ruling came out just say a look. We as a company have been on record for a long time all over the globe that we have a strong view that surcharging is a very consumer unfriendly thing and people who understand what they're paying for a product to is a transact with a merchant and as you would know, but others may not have hit time. Look at today, if you look at the ruling that the UK government has come out with and if you look at the press coverage of it and you look at some of the groups were commenting on it, it is very much being taken and being seen as a pro consumer action. So that to us is a really positive step in the UK. There are many other countries across Europe that are in the midst of debates about what to do about surcharging. The way - as you know there's great complexity and the interplay between the EU payment rules and what then gets translated in each country, but certainly we would hope that the UK actions are emulated in many other countries. It's a good thing for the consumer long term and we think it's a good thing for us. I would say Craig, I don't know the today it has had a material impact on our ability to continue to grow our business. As you know, the UK has been one of our strongest markets. This quarter I cited its growth again being at 15% in terms of volumes and it's been growing at those kind of levels quite some time. But over the longer term, we think this is just good policy and is helpful to us as well. In terms of charge offs, I am - I think we've remained very comfortable that what we're seeing on the credit side is right within the balance of what we would have expected given the growth we're seeing in lending. We do not see any signs of a broader economic change that is causing any change in the credit. Profile side, I would say we are performing exactly as I would have expected. We are growing loans a little faster than we had in the original plan. And so that will also drive overtime a little higher mix of new accounts going through a seasoning process. So I think our real focus is making sure we stay with best in class metrics and we grow lending at good economics within the plan ranges we have, because our goal is to grow lending as fast as we can. Within that I might be cautious about guiding you to a specific number on write-offs, but I would just say we feel really good about where we are today.\nCraig Maurer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Just the rewards competition, suggested - Steve Squeri suggested and so did David norms at recent conference that they thought that the rewards competition had peaked, I know obviously in aggressive level, but seem to a peak. I just wondered if you - if you're seeing that still month and a half, months, month and a half later, if you feel that's the case or not? And just also just on a cost base, how close are you to being done with the moves you need to make to hit the $1 billion?\nJeffrey Campbell: Let me take those in turn Bob. I guess on rewards, I would say well gosh, I hope that Steve and David are correct. But look we don't run the company making any assumption other than it's going to be continue to be a very competitive environment. We're going to continue to have to innovate and find new ways to offer value to our customers. And look you know the value enhancements we did with platinum were significant. They're being very well received by customers in driving just the kind of increased engagement and increase new Card Member acquisition that we wanted. But we will continue to follow the competitive environment and continue to make sure that we offer great value propositions relative to what others put in the market. Always mindful of the fact that we have some very unique and differentiated assets to offer and we're always going to focus on trying to leverage those as opposed to the things that are perhaps most easily replicated. On the cost question, look it's July 19th so we have I would say 100% of our plans clearly in hand well laid out. They are not all executed, but they are all partially executed and we're working towards being done with all of those things as we get into the latter part of this year. So at this point, I'm very confident in our ability to get more than a $1 billion of growth cost out of the company. As I did say in our remarks that progress combined with the revenue performance is allowing us to reinvest in a few areas those savings. So for example, we are doing some things with our call centers to drive more revenue in new Card Members that have been extremely successful for us and frankly the savings we've generated elsewhere in the way we run our call centers have allowed us to do those kinds of things. And of course there is always things that I try not to talk about on calls like. We also have to cover with these cost savings. And my favorite so far this year that is the $60 million or $70 million of hedge and effectiveness started though we've taken thus far this year. Really I try not take about that stuff because that's why we're taking a billion dollars out of the cost structure. So you don't particularly notice the increases that come from things like that. So I feel good about our progress, but to be clear, there is work to do but is just execution, it's not gee we still need to find another $100 million. It's very clearly in ourselves.\nBob Napoli: Great, thank you. Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Go ahead please.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question. Look, one of the unique growth drivers here is the wallet share gains in terms of getting your existing customers to borrow. Two questions relating to that in both credit, how do you prevent adverse selection when you are offering a customer who's been offered the opportunity to pay overtime for years? How do you know that you are not getting sort of picked off at exactly the wrong time to make a loan that customer who said no before?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, Rick, you know it's a good question and one we think a lot about in many ways I would point to our track record which is several years of steadily growing above the industry will still retaining by far the best in class credit metrics. How do you do that? Well you do that by focusing on your existing customer base to a great extend where we know our customers extremely well and we know a lot about them and have a strong ability to make the kind of judgments you are pointing out we have to make. We do it by we believe having best in class data efforts that both involve the way we use our own data, the way we use every bit of data across the industry and we combine it with what we think are best in class data science experts and efforts to be really thoughtful. Do we get right 100% of the time? No, we don't. But do we get it right enough for the time so that we are able to retain best in class credit metrics? Absolutely. And look, we are very mindful of the broader environment and what all of our competitors are and are not doing. And I would say we are constantly evolving our tactics in this area a very real time as we see other things happening in the industry with our competitors with the economy.\nRick Shane: And Jeff, did those loans season in same way that a de novo customer does?\nJeffrey Campbell: No. So you certainly see different behavioral patterns as you take on a brand new customer versus as we grew lending balances with existing customers. Then there can still to your point be a seasoning process but they follow different patterns which we of course track based on our historical experiences.\nRick Shane: Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yep, thanks Rick.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Go ahead please.\nChris Donat: Thanks for taking my question Jeff. I wanted just to go back to the Card Member services because as we look back historically thinking about Card Member services is a percentage of discount revenue, it's been growing, seems like it should be growing more as you lay around the Uber credit baggage some of the Delta co-brand changes more the Centurion lounges. I am just wondering should we be thinking about that as a - that line for Card Member service is really as a percentage of discount revenue or are you getting more kind of fixed fees in there with the lounges? A little bit of guidance on that.\nJeffrey Campbell: It's a good question. We've made a conscious pivot I would say to even more than we have historically on our value propositions emphasis the things that are hard for others to replicate and a lot build on our scale, our global reach, our brand. And so the lounge access is a great example of that. We have to scale to both build our own Centurion lounges as well as collect an unequalled amount of access to lots of other lounges around the globe and that is high valued by our Card Members. And all that runs to cost of Card Member services and as you should goes up, it drives the cost up. The Uber benefit is another great example. In many ways Chris, the reason why starting I think back at Investor Day, I began to talk collectively about our marketing and promotional rewards and cost of Card Member cost is because it is important that people realize that we think of those as three tools we are using to drive more revenue. And particularly right now, the fastest growing in terms of - in percentage terms, fastest growing tool is cost of Card Member services and I'd expect it will stay that way because of this pivot to really want to emphasis the things we can do uniquely. I think it's a little tricky to, so most of those things are not going to be directly tied in any ways to billing or discount revenue. The way we think of it is you are creating an overall value proposition for your customer that's why we feel really good about our fee revenue increases continuing because it's those kind of experiences whatever the point proposition is that we have to make really appealing to our customers to build loyalty overtime. So that may not be as helpful as you would like in terms of how you might model this, but that's really how we think about the things that are appearing in that line from a business perspective.\nChris Donat: That's helpful. And just if I can tag on that, anything on that - any surprising seasonality we should be thinking about there that I don't know baggage fees increase in one quarter or?\nJeffrey Campbell: No, no, that one there really shouldn't be any particular seasonality in.\nChris Donat: Got it. Thanks Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hey David.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Question about the regulatory environment in Europe which you referenced in your comments on the call. How are you positioning American Express to win in environment under PSD2 regulation where we start to ACH based ecommerce payments in Europe within the next couple of years? You know Visa is leaving its options open. MasterCard just buy VocaLink, so I am curious what your strategy is?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, boy, very good and large question. David that I could probably spend another hour taking about, but let me maybe just make a few comments. Clearly Europe is a heavily regulated market that regulation is evolving and regulation evolves in way that aren't always crystal clear. What we do have is a unique business model that gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of how we think about the best way to create value for merchants, who we have to directly negotiate with and convince to accept our card and to their fees and directly create value propositions with Card Members that they will continue to use even in light of all the other changes that to your point are likely to happen in that marketplace. In some ways if you look at our results in Europe the last few quarters in place like the UK, we have seen tremendous growth with some of the changes drive elsewhere in the market with various aspects of the payment service directly. But it's a long game here and I think there are many chapters still to play out. You will see us evolve our business. You will see a significant reductions in coming quarters in the network aspect of our business in Europe which is a small part of our company, it's 10% of our European business which is 10% of our company. So it's 1% or 2% of billings. But you will see that's really significantly reduce that business in response to somebody evolving regulation. And obviously our opportunity and challenge as we do that is in fact to recapture a good chunk of that business on our proprietary network, which at times can actually generate more profits than we see on the network business. So as always we are focused on, how do we use our unique business model, our unique brand in assets to create value propositions for both merchants and for Card Members that are very different from what others can offer? And in many ways I actually think it's complicated as it is. The European payment regulations as they evolve may well provide us new opportunities because we're so different from everybody else. But we'll have to see as time goes by.\nDavid Togut: Understood, thanks.\nToby Willard: And Cathy, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that will come from James Freedman with Susquehanna Financial. Go ahead please.\nJames Freedman: Hi. Thanks for just taking me into, I have just a quick question Jeff, at the Analyst Day on March 8 you had or Anre had an update about OptBlue, I was just wondering you make any comments tonight about that, but where are we in that journey we closer to the middle of the beginning or the end, how we should think about the contribution to growth things like that? Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yeah, it's a good question James, and I probably should have mentioned it in my remarks. We're in the middle of the game, so we've been clear for a while that we have the company very focused on getting to parity coverage in the U.S. by 2019. We are really pleased now to have all of the large merchant acquirers in the U.S. involved in the program. I would point out to you that the last of the larger ones have come on fairly recently to the program, and it just takes time given the nature of how the acquirers work with small merchants to cycle across the many, many hundreds of thousands and in fact millions of merchants that we need to cycle across year. But we're making good progress and we remain very focused on our 2019 goal. As you've heard me say this is a really important goal for the company for the long term. But it is a long term goal. And you know first we have to get to parity then we have to really change perceptions amongst our customers. Those are long, long game. And I don't think if you look at our financial results today that you see a material upside. Today, when you just do the simple math of we have a lot more small merchants than we used to, we get business from those small merchants and that incremental or the revenues we get from that incremental business more than cover the lesser overall amount of economics for getting from all small merchants as we put them on OptBlue, so that's a net positive. But the real game here is about once we get to parity and once we change perceptions, it's about getting a greater share of wallet because of that and it's about having an ability to be more efficient in our New Card member acquisitions, because of this. And I think we're still a couple of years away from seeing in a really material way the benefits from that. So thank you for the question.\nToby Willard: Thanks everybody for joining tonight's call, and thank you for your continued interest in American Express. Cathy, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Mr. Toby Willard. Please go ahead sir.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Gary. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2017 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that maybe discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well. Thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re off to a solid start to 2017. Our earnings per share for Q1 was $1.34 and we\u2019re encouraged by the momentum we see in our revenue performance. As you know, accelerating revenue growth through capturing opportunities across our diversified business model has been a key priority for us. In addition, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and continue to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback programs. In many ways, our Q1 results show the steady progress we\u2019re making on the range of growth and cost initiatives that we have put in place over the last couple of years and that we reviewed at our Investor Day last month. These initiatives have been supported by the spending that we did over the last two years. We expect that these efforts will all come together to help us produce steady results during 2017 and position us well for the longer-term. Going forward we remain focused on delivering improvement in EPS as we progress through 2017 and beyond this, we\u2019re equally focused on our strategies to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth. While it is still early in the year and we have work to do, our first quarter is a positive start to hear. With that, let me turn to the detailed results, starting with the summary financial performance on Slide 2. Revenue for the first quarter was down 2% reflecting lower discount revenue and net interest income following the Costco portfolio sale in Q2 of last year. When excluding FX and Costco related revenues in the prior year, our adjusted revenue growth accelerated modestly to 7% on a sequential basis. The first quarter also included as expected given the volume growth we\u2019re seeing a greater year-over-year increase in provision and rewards than we experienced in the fourth quarter. Net income was down 13% versus the prior year first quarter. As we continue to grow over the co-brand exits from 2016. As we move through 2017, we expect net income and EPS to grow due to the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives and the seasonality of revenue. Of course we expect a return to year-over-year net income and EPS growth as we get to the second half of 2017. Earnings per share of $1.34 reflects our net income performance and also the benefits of our strong capital position. Over the last year, we returned $4.1 billion of capital to shareholders through our share repurchase programs, which has resulted in a 6% reduction in average shares. These results brought our ROE for the 12 months ended in March to 25%. So with that is the summary, let me now turn to a more detailed review of our results starting with billings. You can see on Slide 3 the world wide FX adjusted billings were flat in the quarter versus the prior year. To get a better understanding of the underlying trends on Slide 4 as we have in recent quarters, we show billings growth adjusted for both changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of Costco. Here you can see that adjusted billings growth accelerated modestly to 8% in the quarter. The acceleration was broad based. As you can see in both the segment view of billings on Slide 5 and the geographical view of billings on Slide 6. Across all of these views, I would point out a number of trends in our billings performance this quarter. In the GCS segment, we continue to see strong growth in the small business and middle market customer segments. Adjusted volumes in the U.S. grew at 11% in the quarter and outside the U.S. volume growth accelerated. In the large and global GCS customer segment spending volumes were up a bit as compared to last year. As we have said for a while now we would expect that this will remain a slower growth segment absent an uptick in travel and entertainment spending by larger corporations, which we have not yet seen. The U.S. consumer segment growth rate was consistent with Q4 2016. We are pleased with the impact of the initial changes we made last October in our U.S. consumer platinum product. It\u2019s too early to comment on the most recent changes to the product as they just took effect at the end of the first quarter. In the international consumer and network services segment the billings growth rate improved sequentially to 8% on an FX adjusted basis. Looking at the two parts of the segment, volumes from proprietary cards grew at 11%, reflecting continued strength in several international markets. In GNS, the FX adjusted growth improved from 4% in Q4 to 6% in Q1, as we saw sequential improvements in all of EMEA, JAPA and LACC. GNS plays an important role in strengthening our global network. I would remind you though that going forward as we previously discussed we do expect pressure on GNS volumes due to the changing regulatory environment specifically in the EU, Australia and China. Given the lower margins we are in GNS however, this will have a less bottom line impact. Moving to international in total, you can see on Slide 6 that our billings growth rates remained strong. As we saw our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit in FX adjusted terms growth and overall international accelerated to 13% FX adjusted growth. The improvement in international is broad-based, with strength in both our corporate and consumer businesses. As we look at a few key markets for example we see continued strong FX adjusted growth in the UK up 17%, in Mexico of 15% and in Japan also up 15%. Finally I would briefly note a couple of calendar impacts to growth rates in the quarter. As I mentioned at Investor Day, the leap day in February 2016 negatively impacts growth rates this quarter by about 1%. Offsetting that somewhat we did see a benefit in March is the Easter holiday mood from Q1 last year to Q2 this year. In many international markets there is an extended holiday around Easter, which impacts volumes. Stepping back we are encouraged by the momentum we see in the adjusted billings growth rate. The improvement is coming across our segments globally and reflects returns on the investments we have made over the last couple of years. We still have work to do. And the competitive environment especially in U.S. consumer remains intense, but we are focused on driving more volume onto our network from our wide range of growth opportunities. Turning now to our worldwide lending performance on Slide 7, our total loans were up 12% versus the prior year on an FX adjusted basis, slightly below the growth rate we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. As we have for several years now, we continue to grow U.S. loans faster than the industry, driven primarily by our success in growing loans from existing customers. During the first quarter, more than 50% of the growth in U.S. consumer loans came from existing customers, consistent with the trend we described at our Investor Day. As we look forward, we believe that we can continue to grow loans above the industry rate given our unique growth opportunities, while maintaining best in class credit performance. Looking at the right hand side of the slide, you can see that net interest yield has been steadily expanding and rose again sequentially in Q1 to 10.3%. Yields typically widen in the first quarter due to seasonality. But the steady trend we are seeing is driven by the impact of a number of factors, including a shift in mix to non-cobrand customers, who are more likely to revolve, less revolving loans at introductory rates. Some specific pricing actions, and of course a benefit from increases in bench mark interest rates without an offsetting change to our personal savings deposit rate. We do expect deposit rates will move up overtime, but we remains to be seeing when that change will occur and how much rates will increase. Before turning to provision, let me touch on our credit metrics. Delinquency in last metrics across our lending in charge card portfolios continued to be very strong. And the worldwide loan portfolio, you can see that the delinquency rate was flat to Q4 and loss rates increased slightly both sequentially and year-over-year. The modest increase and lending loss rates versus the prior year is in line with our expectations and consistent with our view, the loss rates would begin to increase due to the seasoning of the new accounts and the shift towards non-cobrand products, which have a slightly higher right of way rate, but also generate greater yield. And this quarter\u2019s lending results reflect that dynamic. The combination of continued strong loan and receivable growth and modestly higher year-over-year loss rates, including in certain charge card segments, has caused our provision, as expected to grow well above the growth rate in loans as you can see on Slide 9. As we look forward to the balance of the year, we expect that provision will continue to grow faster than loans, a trend that is fully contemplated in our earnings expectations. Turning to our revenue performance on Slide 10. FX adjusted revenues were down 2%, when we adjust for both FX and Costco related revenues to get at the underlying trend, revenue grew at 7%. I will say that adjusted revenue growth in the quarter outperformed our own internal expectation as in the month of March billings and revenue both came in above our plans. We are pleased with the momentum in our adjusted revenue growth rate. And we are encouraged to begin the year bit above the full year range, we\u2019ve provided at Investor Day of 5% to 6% adjusted revenue growth. Looking at the components of revenue in more detail. Discount revenue declined by 3%, but increased by 6% on an adjusted basis. The discount rate in the quarter was 2.45% up 1 basis point year-over-year, due to lower rate volumes coming of the network more than offsetting the impact from merchant negotiations mix and the continued rollout of OptBlue in the U.S. Well the discount rate increased year-over-year, the ratio of discount revenue to build business declined by 4 basis points, which I welcome back to in just a minute. Net card fees grew by 7% in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our premium U.S. portfolios including Platinum, Gold and Delta, as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia. The Platinum fee increases we announced in March are not yet impacting the results as the fee increase for existing customers does not go into effect until September. Other fees and commissions grew 5% in the quarter, while other revenue declined by 16%. Other revenue growth is impacted by the sale of a small business, which provided back office systems to run third party loyalty programs, during December 2016. Net interest income is down 5% due to lower average loans, but increased 15% on an adjusted basis driven by the 12% growth in adjusted loans in the higher net interest yield that I mentioned previously. Coming back now to the ratio, discount revenue to build business on Slide 12. You can see that this ratio was down 4 basis points versus the prior year, while the reported discount rate was up one basis point. The decline in the ratio, discount revenue to billings this quarter is driven by a shift in billings mix towards GNS and higher incentive payments to cobrand and corporate card partners as the volumes in those categories accelerate. Turning now to our total expenses on Slide 13. Our expenses were 1% higher than the prior year during the first quarter, though I\u2019d note that performance trends varied across the different expense lines. At Investor Day, we highlighted that are spending on card member engagement is reflected across marketing and promotion, rewards and Card Member services expenses. And I\u2019ll discuss the changes in those P&L lines on the following slide. Moving to operating expenses, total operating costs during the quarter were down 3% versus the prior year. I\u2019d remind you that in the prior year operating expenses were impacted by $127 million gain from the JetBlue portfolio sale and an $84 million restructuring charge. We continue to make progress on our cost reduction initiatives and believe that we are on track to remove $1 billion in the company\u2019s cost based on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we expect the year-over-year decline in operating expenses to be larger as we exit 2017 than what we saw in Q1. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.9%, which is below our full year 2017 expectation of 33% to 34%. The Q1 tax rate benefited from some discrete tax items, we continue to believe that our full year rate will be more in line with our 33% to 34% expectation. Moving to the summary of our Card Member engagement spending on Slide 14, total engagement spending in Q1 was $2.8 billion or 4% higher than the prior year. Looking at the components of that spending as expected, M&P was down 4% versus the prior year. These results are consistent with our comments at Investor Day about anticipating a reduction in our M&P spending versus 2016 levels. We continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our marketing spend by using our scale to consistently drive cost savings from our ongoing marketing operations. We also continue to shift our focus towards existing card members and increase our use of digital channels both of which can add efficiencies. With all these efforts, despite a lower level of marketing spend, we acquired more new cards during the first quarter than we did during Q4, including 1.7 million cards across our U.S. issuing businesses and 2.6 million on a worldwide basis. Over 60% of the Global Consumer cards we acquired in the quarter came through digital channel. And digital is particularly important as you know, for acquiring new millennial card members. And going forward, we continue to anticipate that full year 2017 M&P will be lower than 2016 and more similar to the full year 2015 levels. I\u2019d note however, that the ultimate level of marketing expenses will be influenced by our financial performance and the opportunities present in the marketplace. Moving to rewards, consistent with our Investor Day expectations, rewards expense was up 6% despite a small decline in proprietary billing volumes versus the prior year. Adjusting for the Costco cobrand volumes in the prior year, rewards expense would have increased in the quarter by 20%, while adjusted proprietary billings grew by 6%. This growth in rewards resulted in a ratio of rewards cost to proprietary billings of 87 basis points. The greater year-over-year increase in reward expense during the quarter reflects the impact of the enhancements to our U.S. platinum products that we implemented at the beginning of Q4 2016, as well as continued strong growth our Delta co-brand portfolio. Cost of card member services increased 14%, reflecting higher engagement levels across our premium travel services including airport lounge access and co-brand benefits such as First Bag Free on Delta. As we highlighted in Investor Day, this is an area where we can offer differentiated benefits and we\u2019ll continue to invest as evidenced by the rollout of the new Uber benefits on our platinum cards a few weeks ago. Turning now to Slide 15 and touching on capital. We continue to use our strong balance sheet position to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. Over the last nine quarters, we have returned a 101% of the capital we have generated. I think this shows the commitment we have over time to leveraging our business model and capital position steadily create shareholder value. Now we of course just completed our submission for the 2017 CCAR process earlier this month. And as I\u2019m sure you all aware the process continues to revolve each year. We remain confident in the strength of our business model and our ability to drive shareholder value to capital returns. Now of course, we also use capital to support business building activities such as growth and our loan balances, potential M&A activity. In addition to returning capital through dividends and share buybacks. I\u2019d also remind you that our capital plan for the upcoming year will be dependent upon the Fed review and we expect to hear back from them about our submission in June. Step in back, over the past several years we have embarked on a serious of initiatives to reposition the company drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts which we covered in Investor Day, include, amongst others, focusing on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets on our global commercial segments, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant network and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These action for targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer-term. While the impact from those efforts, we\u2019ll play out over time. We are encouraged with the trend that we have seen in our business metrics and revenue growth over the past several quarters and believe that these initiatives are driving real momentum. As we look out to the balance of the year, we believe that our outlook for the full year 2017 EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.80 remains appropriate. As we discussed at Investor Day we anticipate that EPS will grow through the year and as we have in the past, we will continue to balance delivering earnings to the bottom-line and investing for the moderate to long-term. We do believe that our 2017 plans appropriately balance shorter-term profitability with the steps we need to take to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the longer-term. With that, let me turn it back over to Toby and we\u2019ll move to Q&A.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Gary?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks and good results. I guess I\u2019m just making sure that the EPS outperformance in the first quarter relative to what you articulate at the Analyst Day was really a result of revenue outperformance as you mentioned Jeff. And I guess when we think about the difference between the $5.60 versus the $5.80 in your range, is the difference how much you\u2019d spend on investments?\nJeff Campbell: Well. Couple comments Sanjay and thank you for the question. You are correct that relative to our expectations early in large at Investor Day. What surprised us frankly in the month of March was how strong the revenue performance came in. And so that is the main driver of why our EPS for the quarter ended up being a little bit stronger than I would have expected back in that first week of March. On the margins I\u2019d also point out that we had a few tax discrete items, you\u2019re always working on various tax audit settlements and things like that, that are a little bit hard to time, and so those came in and out at a couple pennies as well, although over the course of the year that number is not particularly material. In terms of our guidance for the year, I guess I\u2019d come back to what I said in my earlier remarks. Sanjay we feel really good about the start we\u2019re off to, but, gosh, it\u2019s only one quarter and we have a lot of work to do as we go through the years. Certainly we are encouraged by the revenue performance. And I would say based on the first quarter, I\u2019d certainly think it\u2019s much likelier that we will be at the higher end of the revenue range that I talked about in Investor Day which was for adjusted revenue growth to be at 5% to 6%. But we like a little bit more time pass before we convert that into what that might be for EPS. I would just include by saying we certainly feel very confident in the $5.60 to $5.80 EPS guidance range that we have reconfirmed again today.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Great. Thanks, Sanjay.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Eric Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much. Just to follow-up on that on Sanjay\u2019s line of questioning. You\u2019ve in the past articulated in a various scenarios for revenue growth translating into a \u2013 to certain levels of earnings growth. And so given that you\u2019re now accelerating towards the high end of your range, which is really quite impressive, given the competitive environment. How do we conceptualize the relationship between revenue growth and operating leverage as it relates to the earnings outlook?\nJeff Campbell: Well. You are right Eric. That we have a pretty simple financial model we like to talk about, which all starts with taking advantage of the range of revenue growth opportunities we have and to the extent we can get good revenue growth, the fixed cost nature of our business allows us to get pretty steady operating expense leverage. And the fact that we\u2019re not overly capital intensive in our business allows us to use our capital strength to add a little bit more to EPS growth. It\u2019s pretty simple model, but it all starts with the revenue growth line. You heard us talk a lot at Investor Day in early March about how focus we are in the objective of getting to a sustainable 6% revenue growth rate and when you look at the business model we have \u2013 we can achieve that, we certainly are then confident we can get to EPS growth of more than 10% steadily. What I would say, this is 1 quarter. We feel really good about the quarter end. Certainly in 2017 I\u2019d remained you that when you think about prior year including a big game on a couple portfolio sales as well as happy year of earnings from that partnership that, we no longer have. Our EPS growth if you consider those things in 2017 is of course quite high way, way, way above the more than 10% level and that\u2019s because we are getting an unusual amount of operating expense leverage because of our efforts to take $1 billion out of cost structure. And because as we built into our guidance and as we\u2019re off to a good start on we have pretty good revenue growth in the projections we have for 2017. So what all that translates into 2018 and beyond we\u2019ll have to see, but I think we feel pretty positive about the start we\u2019re off to this year.\nEric Wasserstrom: Great. Thanks very much.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Please go ahead\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Hi, thanks. Looking to ask a question on a less glamorous subject. Could you comment on where attrition has been running and how that\u2019s trended over the last 12 months? The new account growth is very impressive, and I just was hoping to balance it with the other side of the equation.\nJeff Campbell: Sure thanks for the question. As you have heard us talk about probably in multiple forms, when you look across our geographies and our customer segments, our attrition rates are modest and actually remarkably stable. They just don\u2019t move that much. I think it\u2019s certainly got a lot of attention when we talked about the fact for a few weeks last year in the U.S. consumer premium segment, when you look that Platinum cards you had a very modest uptick in attrition that quickly came back down. But all of these numbers for attrition across all of our businesses are in the low single digits on an annualized basis. So we really haven\u2019t seen any change when I look across the different business and the different geographies Craig, in those numbers and to finish of the Platinum story while we saw that one little blip for few weeks, in fact we ended 2016 with more Platinum Card Members in the U.S than we\u2019ve ever had in more spending on the Platinum Card that we\u2019ve ever had in a year. So we are always focused on providing great value to our customers we very much try to target our value propositions at customers who want to build long-term relationships with the company. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. And right now we don\u2019t see any signs of any change in our ability to do that. So thank you for the question.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you and now at line of Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hi, good evening Jeff. I was wondering if I can ask a question on rewards. They were up 20% year-over-year I believe last quarter you talk about something closer to 13%. Is this really just a ramping up of the cost associated with the updated Platinum Card value proposition? Are you still expect to rewards to grow at that pace? Or given the changes that you made, are you now expecting them to grow faster? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So couple things. It\u2019s a good question Ryan. We \u2013 if you go back probably a year you heard us first day at our Investor day in 2016 that when you just think acknowledge the reality of the competitive environment mostly in the U.S. consumer segment. We said at the time we expected to our rewards cost to grow a little faster than billings. In fact if you look at most of 2015 and 2016 they really weren\u2019t there were growing roughly in line with billings. But our expectation for some time has been that you would in select cases, see us change some value propositions. In early October of last year, we did make some more significant value proposition changes in both the business and consumer platinum products in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased with the early results on both of those. But that step up is what drove our rewards costs up in Q4 of 2016, I\u2019d say you saw probably the full effect, because you probably in quite get the full effect in Q4. In this quarter and so you will continue to see that ballpark level of year-over-year increase until we\u2019re done lapping those changes as you get to the last quarter of 2017. All that said, I would remind everyone, we feel good, as a general matter, about our value propositions today. And I think the mere fact that we had another really strong quarter of acquiring new Card Members is a demonstration that across the range of geographies and customer segments and products that we have, we think we have very competitive value propositions when you look at both what Doug Buckminster referred to in our Investor Day as the sort of real \u2013 a table stakes elements of the product, which are about rewards and pricing as well as the experiential value that we work very hard to uniquely offer given the range of unique strengths we have. So I would expect to see, in some, the rewards cost continue to grow for the next couple of quarters. It is mostly Platinum, although there\u2019s also some really nice growth we\u2019re seeing in a few of our cobrand relationships like Delta that also pushed the number up a little bit. But it\u2019s mostly Platinum, and we should be done lapping it as we get to the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you and now to the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.\nJamie Friedman: Hi, thanks, Jeff. I just want to ask you it\u2019s on slide 16 of the appendix. If you don\u2019t have it in front of you, I don\u2019t want to disorient you. But the question is the spending per Card Member did decline to $3,297 this quarter. And I was just wondering if you could just give us some context. In fairness, when you look at it, it does look seasonal. But any context that you can give \u2013 if you don\u2019t have that in front of you, that\u2019s fine. But is that $3,297, is that a good or bad number? Should that be going up or down? The context of that will be helpful. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m paging through, James, to be exact with the numbers. But I guess, I\u2019d make a few comments. First off, remember, when you look at average spend year-over-year, the sale of the Costco cobrand has caused some dislocations attempt to on a year-over-year basis actually go in the other direction. Because the average spend per card was a little lower. When you look sequentially in \u2013 Toby just handed me this.\nToby Willard: Yes, so if you look \u2013 now I don\u2019t have the page in front of me. So you see that when you look year-over-year at the 7% increase. When you go sequentially by quarter, you are correct that in Q4, most of us, and I put myself in this camp, tend to spend a little bit more in Q4 given the holiday season than you do in other times of the year. So I don\u2019t particularly see anything in the sequential change that should be particularly meaningful. I think the more significant thing is to look at the year-over-year change where you\u2019re taking the seasonality out. You do see it up a little bit, although, as I said, that is aided somewhat by the shift in the mix of cards because of the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio.\nJamie Friedman: Got it. Thanks for the help.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you Jamie\nOperator: Thank you and now to line of Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Yes Jeff I wanted to just shift gears to cobrands, briefly. I think you have the Hilton deal that might be coming up. Can you talk about when that renews and size it and also how you view sort of an airline hotel deal versus the retail deal?\nJeff Campbell: Well I think Don as I\u2019m sure you expect me to say, we really value all of our cobrand partners, and I would put Hilton in that category. And you didn\u2019t ask, but it\u2019s probably on your mind. I would put SPG in that category, and we work really hard everyday to create value for our card members, for our partners and for our shareholders. Beyond that, I can\u2019t comment on specific contract terms for what might be the ultimate outcome of Marriott as they think about what to do with the 2 cobrands that are now offered to both Marriott Rewards and SPG Card Members or what Hilton might choose to do as it thinks about its current 2 cobrand partners. What I would say is that to the distinction you made, we do think that there are certain types of cobrand partners who are interested in building value, and business together. Cobrand partners who are focused on some of the travel and entertainment oriented strings that we have I would remind you that we run a big consumer travel agency and we have a joint venture to run a big business travel agency and we have a long, long, long, long way to see of being very strong in attracting a customer base that is very travel oriented. And so we do think that allows us to bring some unique strengths to travel oriented cobrand, that\u2019s quite frankly, probably are at there in certain retail cobrands or often a retailer as we talked about on and off over the last couple of years. And often, the retailer is really after, in many ways, a payment vehicle that will allow their customers to do some level of borrowing. And while, as you know, one of our strategic initiatives is trying to capture more of our own customer borrowing behaviours as a general matter, we remain a Spend-Centric oriented company and we\u2019re less likely to be real focused on a real competitive on products where the economics are really driven 100% by lending. So we\u2019ll have to see where things like Marriott and Hilton goal going forward, but we\u2019re focused everyday and providing value to those partners.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Good afternoon. So Jeff 7% growth \u2013 revenue growth in the quarter and March was the strongest and you had the leap year FX. So I guess that would suggest that there\u2019s a possibility that you could have some accelerating \u2013 an acceleration in revenue growth. And I know you\u2019re reiterating 5% to 6% and really to 1 quarter. But looking at the trend it seems like you might be able to go above the high end of that range. And then partly affecting that it\u2019s kind of I mean I\u2019ve covered this company a long time the international business seems to have more momentum than I\u2019ve \u2013 I can remember. The spend growth accelerating each of the last three quarters. Is that helping to drive that acceleration or why is international? I mean you\u2019re still just scratching the surface of the potential. Why is international? Is it just more investment there? So sorry, it\u2019s kind of two questions but related.\nJeff Campbell: Well. Thanks for the question Bob. Certainly we are encouraged as I said by the momentum we see across our billings growth, our loan growth and our revenue growth. It is early in the year right and I guess I make just a few balancing comment. Yes, March given stronger than we expected in certainly revenue growth even stronger than we expected. We do a little bit of rounding I will point out to simplify in the slide if you go calculate the precise number, you will see that our Q4 revenue growth rate on an adjusted basis was about 6.4% and in Q1 was 6.6%. So it does around 6% to 7%, but you have to put it into a little perspective. Leap day certainly hurt us in Q1. I will say outside the U.S. and particularly in our business segment Easter going to April probably helped us a little bit and then yes, we feel really good about the momentum we had built over international. So you will see some modest win, so as you get later end of the year first regulatory reasons they talk is going to impact the network business. I\u2019ll have a bigger billings impact in revenue or profit impact. We\u2019d some small revenue impact. So we\u2019re driving management team on getting to is much revenue growth as we can get to. We are really pleased with the start we\u2019re off to. As I did say earlier it does certainly maybe we should be at the higher end of that 5% to 6% range when I talked about yesterday for the year per adjusted revenue growth. I just think we\u2019d like to see a little bit more time pass and a little bit more performance before we move beyond that number. So thank you for the comments.\nBob Napoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And now to line of David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ho: I appreciate the comments on March. Just curious there\u2019s been a lot of debate on the disconnect between the rising consumer confidence in the U.S. and not translating to overall kind of consumer spend they obviously you\u2019re seeing in certain areas. Your T&E billings for the U.S. are still down year-over-year, but certainly trends are looking better. How much you think upside do you believe based on your new rewards propositions in some of these service-oriented categories travel and entertainment, would you capture kind of in the next cycle if it were to play out. Obviously it\u2019s not really in your numbers and your guidance so far.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. Well, there\u2019s probably a couple questions there David. The first thing I\u2019d say is that through March 31 as we look at our result it\u2019s hard for us to see anything that suggestive of a material uptick in consumer confidence or consumer or commercial spending. Well, we have been gaining momentum as we look at the many different areas gaining momentum. We can see a change that we have made and how we\u2019re running the business and what value propositions we\u2019re offering, et cetera, that seems to be what is driving the change as opposed to us getting the benefit of just in generally stronger economic environment. So certainly we are as hopeful as anyone that there in fact is stronger economic growth to come in the future. I just can\u2019t say I\u2019d see any evidence of it right now in our results. And so your comment on T&E certainly one aspect of the changes we\u2019ve announced in the U.S. to our platinum products is to position them both for the consumer and small business segment as being the go to products for the premium travel oriented card member. And we do think that positions us even better than we already are for positions us to be in a good spot to benefit from any increase in consumer spending or commercial spending in those areas. As I say that I would remind you that I think we still consider in going to that latest round of changes as a very, very strong player in the T&E segment. And I think that is the Company\u2019s heritage it remains a tremendous strength of the company. Certainly we have brought in our offerings tremendously over the last couple of decades, but that T&E strength we do think continues and the latest moves we made are just the latest step in ensuring that we don\u2019t lose that positioning. So we\u2019ll have to see. I certainly hope that we see an uptick in spending I just can\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen it. Yes, so thank you David for the question.\nJeff Campbell: Think you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now to line of Rick Shane from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question Jeff. Just curious I mean it\u2019s been observed to strengthen the international business you talked about the decline. You\u2019ve pointed to some anomalies related to the tax rate. I am curious if one of the things that we\u2019re seeing here is the greater contribution from your international businesses on the tax rate and given potential tax reform something everybody should be thinking about.\nJeff Campbell: What \u2013 you are correct if you just think about the U.S. with the co-brand portfolio sales and really steady nice growth in international. You are correct that we\u2019re generating a little bit more of our earnings outside the U.S. and that does have a positive impact on our tax run rate. And that\u2019s actually why even for the year before any of the discrete items that came in this quarter we gave slightly lower guidance for the tax run rate than what you\u2019ve seen in the prior year results. Tax reform \u2013 we\u2019ll have to see, as you\u2019ve heard us say in other forms due to the nature of our business we have a pretty darn high effective tax rate and if you dig through the details of our financial statements, you will realize we pretty much pay that full tax rate in cash to the U.S. So we are a very, very significant tax payer. So any lowering of corporate rates in the U.S. we are likely to be a significant winner on because we\u2019re not a particular beneficiary of any of the very and many things that help other organizations back to pay lower rates. So we\u2019ll have to see, certainly we\u2019re not running the company counting on any changes in the tax area, but it would be a great thing if it were to happen.\nRick Shane: Hey, Jeff and just a follow up on that, given that you talk about the tax rate coming back up a little bit through the remainder of the year not to read too much into the first quarter tax rate. Does that suggest that you think that the business mix is going to shift a little bit? Is there an implication there that we should be considering.\nJeff Campbell: It\u2019s really just a math, Rick, if you take the size of the settlements that drove the discrete items in Q1. In a single quarter they were an up to drag your tax rate out of our 33% to 34% range. If you take \u2013 if we don\u2019t have other settlements, which I generally don\u2019t build them into my forward-looking comments because they\u2019re harder to forecast. Over the course of a full year, they are quite enough to pull you out of your range. They certainly would \u2013 what I would expect will pull us to the lower end of that range, but not necessarily \u2013there\u2019s no differential assumption I\u2019m making about mix.\nRick Shane: Great, thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Thank you. And out of line of Arren Cyganovich from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I was surprised at the strength of the net interest yield. You mentioned that there are some seasonal benefit in the first quarter, just curious is, if you think that current mix shift that you\u2019re getting also is the benefit will continue in maybe just your thoughts on the future trajectory of that net interest yield for the card loan business.\nJeff Campbell: Well, you\u2019re correct, Arren. There is a seasonal element. But as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s really quite a number of other factors that have helped us steadily drive the net interest yield up including some pricing actions we\u2019ve taken, including the fact that with the funding mix we have right now personal \u2013 the personal savings rates we have on our deposits haven\u2019t really moved. So in fact, the Fed interest rates increases so far have been in a positive for the company. Including the mix of customers moving to one where there\u2019s a little bit more revolve, which of course helps the yield. And then we also and this is a benefit that will a bit over time. You\u2019re helped a little bit right now, because we had in our efforts to win back cobrand card members over the last year or two. We had a number of people who were on introductory or promotional offers you were flipping into paying regular rates now. And that\u2019s helping with the rate up a little bit right now. So a lot of factors there. The seasonality base a little bit and the one time impact from winning back some of the cobrand card members will save it bit over time. But all the other things, we think will hold and we think this continues more broadly to be an area, where there is a long, long runway for steady growth in net interest income, right. And where we\u2019ve been growing our loans by having over 50% of the increase come from existing customers or those are people we know we understand the risk profile is further cementing the broad customer relationship we have with them. So we feel really good about what we\u2019re doing here.\nArren Cyganovich: Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Okay, we\u2019ll take one more question, thanks.\nOperator: All right. And that comes from the line of Jason Harbes from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJason Harbes: Hey guys, thank you for squeezing me on here. So most of my questions were asked and answered already. But I did just want to follow up on a comment you made Jeff about some of the initiatives you\u2019re taking to attract millennials on a platform. Perhaps you can elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re doing within the context of a reason New York Times article on a topic.\nJeff Campbell: Well. Jason I appreciate the question. I think first off, it\u2019s important to maybe that\u2019ll set a little bit of the facts. So if you look at last year in our global consumer business \u2013 get to B2B in a minute, but in our global consumer business over 55% new customers brought in [indiscernible] And in fact that number was up about 16% at versus the prior year. If you look at the rolling of applications and new card members who are coming to mobile channels as you would expect. Almost half of those new applicants and card are millennials. If you look at the things we do as a company in the digital sphere, we talk a lot about how the unique nature of our closed loop network allows us to be particularly adept at working with company in the social media, digital and payments field. We really feel like we have been at the forefront of how you bring those three worlds of digital, social media and payments together. In the partnerships, we\u2019ve done with Airbnb with Twitter with Facebook \u2013 with Facebook to have an annex spot. When you look at our pay with points program, which is broader than anyone else\u2019s in the industry, it is disproportionately used by our millennial customers. So we feel really good about our track record of attracting millennials to the franchise. We feel really good about the range of things we do using our unique assets to appeal to millennials. The last thing I\u2019d say though, whether you\u2019re a millennial or a baby boomer or in any cohort. We are however about building long-term customer relationships. And we build products, we build value propositions, we build service experiences that are trying to attract and retain people who are about long-term relationship, not necessarily people who are looking for the latest great thing and they\u2019re going to swap out of it six months. So, look you can never do enough in this area, so we\u2019re focused every day I\u2019m trying to do better. But I think our track record with millennial strong. And I think our ability to leverage our unique assets is strong. So I appreciate the question, but we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re doing so.\nToby Willard: All right. Great. Gary, thanks very much that wraps it up for us.\nOperator: All right, thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today.

Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of full year 2018 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we\u2019ll move to a Q&A session on the financial results, with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Edmund, and good afternoon, everyone. I feel really good about the company\u2019s performance and our position as we start 2019. 2018 was a strong year. The investments we\u2019ve made continue to strengthen many of the attributes that distinguish American Express from our competitors. Unique breadth of services, benefits and rewards that we offer are helping us gain share and scale, which we believe drives sustainable top line growth. We saw continued momentum across the company and throughout the year. Full year FX adjusted revenues grew 10% with the fourth quarter marking the sixth consecutive time revenues grew at least 8%. The total revenue we generated in 2018 was well above our initial expectations and gave us the flexibility to make additional investments in the business each quarter. Our full year EPS of $7.33 after adjusting for tax items was a 24% increase over the prior year. We added 12 million new cards in 2018 and billings growth was strong, particularly with small and medium-size businesses and across international regions. We expanded our merchant coverage around the globe adding over 1 million new locations in the U.S. for the second year in a row and posting double-digit growth internationally. These results demonstrate the advantages that come from our differentiated business model. Our growth was broad based among consumers and businesses and it was well balanced across geographies and business lines. While over 80% of our revenue is coming from discount revenue and fees, we also generated strong loan growth. Our 2018 credit performance was a little better than we expected and the data we derive and analyze from all the parties in our integrated payments platform helped us maintain industry-leading write-offs. We have continued to control our operating expenses which as you saw throughout the year provides operating leverage and the flexibility to make investments in our brand, customer benefits and digital innovation. Our performance strengthens my confidence in our ability to generate and sustain a healthy level of top line revenue growth which is the foundation for steady and consistent double-digit EPS growth. Driving our performance was our focus on and investments in the four strategic imperatives that I established in October of 2017; expanding our leadership in the premium consumer space, building on our strong position in commercial payments, strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value and making American Express an essential part of our customers\u2019 digital lives. In the premium consumer space, we continued to enhance the range of benefits we provide gold and platinum card members. Not just here in the United States but also in India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and Japan. Our relationship with Delta Air Lines continues to grow and the value we are providing to our mutual customers is a major strength for both of us. Like Delta, the partnerships we expanded with Marriott and Hilton take advantage of the power of our integrated payments model harnessing the assets across our card, travel and merchant businesses. Centurion lounges at major airports around the globe continue to provide exclusive value to travelers and we are planning to add more of them in the year ahead. The 2018 results reinforce our view that card members appreciate the unique benefits and services we provide. They recognize and are willing to pay for value, which provides the foundation for earning even a greater share of their spending and borrowing needs going forward. In commercial payments, we\u2019ve built a global footprint that provides a terrific competitive advantage. Our relationships range from small neighborhood businesses to the largest multinational corporations and we continue to deliver value in each segment. We added customized benefits on our business, gold and platinum cards. And as you may recall from last year\u2019s discussion, we formed the strategic partnership with Amazon that includes a co-branded small business card and gives our mutual customers greater control and line-by-line visibility into their online purchases. We are helping small and medium-size businesses grow not just by offering spend capacity but also with products that meet their working capital needs, help to manage their cash flows and handle expenses for temporary employees or contractors. The investments we\u2019ve made in commercial payments are one of the key reasons that small and medium-size businesses continue to be one of our fastest growing customer segments worldwide. Moving on to our third imperative, we are making great progress towards virtual parity in the U.S. and expanding merchant coverage internationally. We\u2019ve begun to leverage our progress with marketing offers that encourage card members to take advantage of the growing number of places where American Express is welcome. That\u2019s good for merchants, it\u2019s good for card members, it\u2019s good for American Express. The same holds true for our 2018 Small Business Saturday and Shop Small campaigns that drove business to merchants in the UK, Australia, Japan and the United States. Looking ahead we are the first foreign company with approval from the People's Bank of China to build a network to process domestic currency transactions. There is still a good deal of work to do but this has the potential to give us an important first-mover advantage. Our fourth imperative making American Express an essential part of our customers\u2019 digital lives cuts across all lines of business. Here again, our differentiated business model provides unique advantages in a world that is becoming digital at a faster and faster pace. More customers are engaging with us through mobile channels and our app, which placed first in the annual J. D. Power survey gives us new ways to serve them and deliver offers that leverage our merchant relationships. Later this year, our expanded partnership with PayPal will provide innovative ways for card members to pay online and make fee-to-fee transfers. We are experimenting with blockchain, AI and other technologies and we are driving innovation through partnerships, acquisitions and enhancements to our own digital platforms. There are many things that make this business special and we\u2019ve been reinforcing that. Not just with strategic business investments but also with the global marketing campaign that we launched in 2018. Our new platform does a terrific job of highlighting the powerful backing of American Express and illustrating why the American Express brand is one of our most important assets. All-in-all, we have a great deal of progress to report, we are generating momentum and our investments will continue to focus on the four strategic imperatives. I believe this approach will help us to sustain the strong revenue growth that is at the heart of our financial model. While there are mixed signals in the political and economic environment, based on what we see in the business we are starting 2019 from a position of strength. We expect full year 2019 revenue growth of 8% to 10% and EPS to be between $7.85 and $8.35. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter of what was a great year for American Express and to layout our expectations for 2019. I will spend a bit more time this afternoon on our full year trends since it is our year end and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we manage the business. Let\u2019s get right into it with our summary financials on Slide 3. Starting with our full year results, our revenue exceeded $40 billion for the first time at 40.3 billion and was up 10% on a FX adjusted basis. Fourth quarter revenue was also up 10% on a FX adjusted basis. This is our highest level of annual managed revenue growth in over a decade and we feel very good about the consistency of our revenue growth over the entire course of 2018. Moving down to net income, I do need to talk for a minute about tax. Our results this quarter contain a number of positive adjustments for some items related to the Tax Act as well as for some tax audit. In total, these tax items amounted to $496 million in 2018\u2019s fourth quarter or a $0.58 EPS impact. And of course, as a reminder, in 2017\u2019s fourth quarter we booked a $2.6 billion charge due to the passage of the Tax Act and Jobs Act. If you adjust for all of these tax items, as we have done on Slide 3, full year 2018 EPS was $7.33, up 24% including the $1.74 of adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. This is stronger performance than we initially anticipated for the year and comes along with our also having been able to fund more long-term growth oriented initiatives than we had originally planned. This sets us up well for the focus that Steve talked about of sustaining a healthy level of top line growth providing the foundation for steady and consistent double-digit EPS growth. So let\u2019s turn to the details of our performance starting with billed business which you see several views of on Slide 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, we\u2019ve broken out our billings growth between AXP proprietary and global network services, our network business. Given the difference in trends right now, we think this is a helpful disclosure. Our proprietary business, which makes up 85% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 11% for the year and 10% for the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The remaining 15% of our overall billings, which come from our network business, GNS, was down 1% for the year and 4% for the fourth quarter on an FX adjusted basis as a result of the ongoing and expected impact of certain regulatory changes. Turning to Slide 5 to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter, I would remind you that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size representing 41% and 44% of Q4 billings, respectively, while global network services makes up the remaining 15% of billings. Starting on the left with our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, U.S. SME was up 10% as it has been in every quarter this year. We are a leader in the U.S. SME space and we feel good about the consistency strong billings that we have had for several years in this customer segment. International SME remains our highest growth customer segment with 21% FX adjusted growth in the quarter. Given the low market penetration we see in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we continue to feel good about our long-term growth opportunity in this segment. In the large and global customer segment, we saw 7% growth on an FX adjusted basis in the fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve been saying for some time, our growth rate in this segment can vary a bit quarter-to-quarter given the large volumes a few customers can drive. So while growth is down from 10% in the third quarter, we see our fourth quarter results as solid. As an aside, as you know, this segment is heavily T&E oriented. And you can see in the earnings tables that our growth overall in U.S. T&E and global airline billings remains strong at 8% on an FX adjusted basis. Moving to U.S. consumer, which made up 32% of the company\u2019s billings in the fourth quarter, billings were up 9% in the quarter. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the high teens as it has been all year at 17% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth in key markets with continued double-digit growth in Japan and Mexico and over 20% growth in both Australia and the UK, all on an FX adjusted basis. Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, global network services was down 4% on an FX adjusted basis driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia where we are in the process of exiting our network business over time as a result of changes in the regulatory environment. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia markets, the remaining portion of GNS was up 7% on an FX adjusted basis. To conclude our billings discussion with Slide 6, you see that across our proprietary business there was a modest sequential decline in the growth rates in the fourth quarter. You will recall that beginning with our Investor Day last March we noted that spending from our existing customers showed an additional increase beginning in Q4 '17 and becoming much more evident in Q1 '18. This occurred across geographies and across customer segments. We attributed it to an increase in confidence with our customer base in the U.S. and around the globe. As we got to the end of 2018, we began to lap that step up. So while we continue to see strong billings growth from existing customers in Q4 '18, we did see some sequential deceleration in the growth rate due to this lapping. So overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of the momentum we see throughout our business. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7, total loan growth was 13% in the fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve said all year, we continue to be focused on driving growth with our existing customers, and about 60% of our growth in lending again came from existing customers this quarter. The Hilton portfolio acquisition that we completed earlier this year is again contributing about 120 basis points to growth this quarter. And I would remind you that we will lap the portfolio acquisition at the end of January. On the right-hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.7%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. For some time we\u2019ve been saying that these increases were going to moderate, we are pleased to see this outcome. The increase was driven by a number of mix and pricing impacts as well as by the fact that we\u2019re continuing to grow our online personal savings program which helps moderate our funding costs in a rising rate environment. In fact, our online personal savings program had higher than expected growth of 24% in Q4. Turning next to the credit metrics on Slide 8. Starting with lending on the left, you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.0%, up 20 basis points for the prior year. On a sequential basis, we were down slightly and we\u2019ve continued to come in better than our expectations throughout the year. On the right side, you can see similar metrics on our charge portfolio. The charge write-off rate, excluding GCP, was 1.4% in the fourth quarter, down 10 basis points from a year ago and down on a sequential basis. I\u2019d remind you though that there is typically more quarterly volatility in these charge rates through seasonality. More broadly as we look at the fourth quarter, we do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment. We continue to feel good about our ability to capture lending share from existing customers while retaining best-in-class credit metrics. These best-in-class metrics led to the $954 million in provision in the fourth quarter that you see on Slide 9. As you know, the accounting for provision is complex which drives some significant quarterly volatility at times. This makes looking at provision growth on a full year basis more meaningful and for the full year 2018 our provision was up 21%. This is a better outcome than we originally anticipated as the provision growth reflects better than expected credit performance somewhat offset by their also being slightly higher loan growth than we originally expected. Turning now to revenues on Slide 10, FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% for the fourth quarter as well as the fourth quarter. As Steve mentioned, this represents the sixth straight quarter of revenue growth of at least 8%, driven by steady growth from a well balanced mix of spending fees and lending. The portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained above 80% for the full year and the fourth quarter. I would also point out that the FX impact of our growth rate for the fourth quarter was larger than in Q3 given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies in which we operate. For those of you interested, I would remind you that we share our exposure to top currencies in the appendix of the earnings slides. Moving to Slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. Discount revenue was up 8% for the year and 7% in the quarter, both on a reported basis, which I\u2019ll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees growth was up 11% for the year and accelerated to 14% in the fourth quarter. We feel especially good about the breadth products that drive our net card fees. The increased engagement that we see with new and existing customers gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong growth in this line. In fact, in recent months we have added value and priced for that value on card products around the world, including our gold cards in the U.S. and UK as well as platinum in Hong Kong, Mexico and India. Net interest income was strong all year and up 17% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by the growth in loans and net yield that I mentioned a few moments ago. Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. On the right you see that we achieved discount revenue growth of at least 8% on an FX adjusted basis in all four quarters of 2018. We feel really good about our performance. And as you\u2019ve heard, Steve and I say many times we are focused on driving discount revenue growth not on the average discount rates. This type of discount revenue growth reflects our ability to optimize our integrated business model and our pricing flexibility. We may selectively adjust discount rate on certain types of transactions which impacts the average discount rate, but ultimately we are doing things that drive profitable economics and discount revenue growth. So while you can see on the left that our average discount rate was down just 1 basis point to 2.36% for Q4, I will say that going forward our focus will continue to be on driving discount revenue growth not the average discount rate. Turning now to expenses on Slide 13, let me first point you to operating expenses which were flat in 2018 even with strong billings growth. A key part of our differentiated business model is our ability to drive operating leverage and our performance in 2018 clearly demonstrates that benefit, and we feel confident in our ability to continue to generate operating leverage going forward. This operating leverage is a key component of our financial model as it helps mitigate the margin compression we are seeing as we invest in our customer engagement costs which you can see on Slide 14 and which were up 14% on a full year basis. Starting at the bottom with marketing and business development, I\u2019ll remind you that this line has two components; our traditional marketing and promotion expenses as well as payments we make to certain partners primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. While partner payments drove higher Q4 expenses, full year marketing and business development was up 13% reflective of our commitment to invest for the long term. Moving up to rewards expense on a full year basis we were up 12%, roughly in line with proprietary billings. Continuing onto card member services, we were up 28% for 2018. As we\u2019ve said throughout the year we expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category as it includes many components of our differentiated value propositions which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits. Turning last now to capital on Slide 15. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 11% which is at the top end of our 10% to 11% target range. During the year we were really pleased that we were able to increase our CET1 ratio by 200 basis points in just four quarters completely recovering from the impact of the $2.6 billion Tax Act charge that we took last year. We did this while increasing our dividend by 11% and while also resuming our share buyback program in the third quarter. This is a great outcome and a testament to the high ROEs that our financial model generates. Looking forward, while there is some uncertainty around what this year\u2019s CCAR process will look like, we feel that being at the top of our 10% to 11% target range positions us well for this year\u2019s process. And so in summary we feel really good about the momentum we built in 2018 with strong growth across our geographies, customer segments and revenue drivers. As Steve said, we are introducing our 2019 earnings per share guidance at a range of $7.85 to $8.35 which assumes revenue growth of 8% to 10% in line with the last six quarters. This outlook is based on what we know today about the economic, regulatory and competitive environment. To state the obvious there is some uncertainty about potential changes in the external environment. I would also add that we can have some volatility from quarter-to-quarter and what we are focused on is achieving the annual earning guidance that we have provided today. Looking at the drivers of our financial results, there are few other key planning assumptions I would highlight. First, full year provision growth is expected to be less than 30%. We expect loan growth to be at levels similar to 2018 as we capture share with our existing customers. And from a credit perspective we expect lending write-off rates and delinquencies to remain below the industry average although we do expect continued modest increases due to seasoning as we\u2019ve seen for some years now. Second, our best estimate of the effective tax rate is around 22%. Also, as a reminder, EPS outlook is subject to the impact of any other contingencies. As we close out 2018, we feel good about the business and are focused on sustaining strong revenue momentum. As we have said, driving 8% to 10% revenue growth does require investment. And as you saw in 2018 we are committed to invest to drive share, scale and relevance. We look forward to providing more insight into our strategic opportunities in 2019 areas of focus during our Investor Day in March. With that, let me turn it back over to Edmund to begin the Q&A.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Jeff, so question about the proprietary billed business moderating in growth rate, I hear you on the tougher comps but is there also sort of a moderation in momentum just given what\u2019s going on globally or are you saying you\u2019re not really seeing any impact? And then as you sort of think into January and Feb, is there anything that you want to call out to us just given all the fears out in the market on the uncertainty?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think as I said, Don, we\u2019ve been talking for almost a year now about what we saw happen late in 2017 and we said at the time while we\u2019ve been doing lots of things to drive more organic growth in our business there is a noticeable step up in the middle of Q4 '17 that we couldn\u2019t tie directly to things we were doing. That sustained itself but there\u2019s a fairly simple lapping issue as you get into Q4 and yet we have passed that. Now obviously there\u2019s a lot going on in the external environment. But when we look at the trend we saw in Q4, it ties pretty strongly to what I just described. Look, it\u2019s early in January. We tend not to comment on results during interim periods or over a couple of weeks. But the fact that we exited the full year with the momentum we had, the fact that we\u2019ve been providing guidance today for revenue growth of 8% to 10% for 2019 I think Don gives you a pretty good sense that we feel really good about all the things that we see within our business. As for the external environment, well, we\u2019ll have to see how 2019 turns out.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. I guess a follow-up question to what Don had and maybe more related to the guidance. So when we think about the revenue guidance, is that assuming some continued moderation in the billed business expectation given the tougher comps as you moved into this year, Jeff? And then on the EPS guidance range, how conceivable is it that you get to the low end of that range on the revenue expectations that you\u2019ve given? Is it in an adverse scenario from an economic standpoint or is there something else in terms of investment that you\u2019re indicating? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. Two good questions. So let me start and Steve will add a little color. On the revenue side, yes, clearly we feel good about the overall momentum that we\u2019re exiting 2018 with. The couple of revenue headwinds we\u2019ve been talking about for a while are you\u2019re lapping the Hilton portfolio and you\u2019re getting a little moderation in our net interest yield. But we feel really good about our ability to sustain strong revenue growth. On the EPS side I think you\u2019re asking a good question, Sanjay, and the point I would make is look there\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty in the environment right now. So in a world where 2019 turns out to look something like 2018 in terms of the economy, you should expect this to be at the mid-to-upper end of the range and the lower end of the range is there when you think about things happening in the equity markets, government is shutdown right now, a little bit of uncertainty. So sure, if the economy weakens a little bit, that\u2019s what the lower end of the range.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. And the only thing I will add is, look, we feel really good about the growth algorithm that we\u2019ve been communicating which is we\u2019re really focused on growing top line revenue growth and to do that we will continue to make those investments that enhance our integrated model, enhance our differentiated business model and continue to make us unique. So I feel really good about 8% to 10% revenue growth guidance coming off six quarters in a row of 8% or plus revenue growth. And the EPS range is as Jeff described it. It\u2019s there to provide a little bit of downside if in fact things don\u2019t continue as we saw in '18 and it\u2019s to provide the upside so that if we continue to have a year like we had this year where just to bring everybody back, it was $6.90 to $7.30 guidance at the beginning of the year and we came in at $7.33 which we feel is a great year for us. So there\u2019s not much more to it than that.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Can I just ask a follow up? I\u2019m so sorry but --\nSteve Squeri: Ohhhhh\u2026\nSanjay Sakhrani: Sorry, all right, fine.\nSteve Squeri: No, go ahead. We\u2019re teasing you.\nSanjay Sakhrani: All right. Just the 8% to 10%, like in that moderating scenario, is it conceivable to hit the 8% to 10% or would it come below that is I guess my question, because that\u2019s tied to the --?\nJeff Campbell: Well, Sanjay, now you\u2019re getting in to discuss hypothetical. Look, we feel really good about our revenue momentum and we can hit 8% to 10% in an environment that weakens a little bit. If it weakens more than a little bit, if it weakens a whole lot, it\u2019s going to get harder. But look, I\u2019m not going to speculate about particular levels.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nKen Bruce: Thanks. Good evening. I don\u2019t think you want to start breaking your own rules two callers into the Q&A. It can get you into some trouble. So, look, you\u2019ve had a number of great quarters. Momentum had been accelerating. This is the first quarter that we\u2019ve seen some deceleration. I\u2019m interested in terms of when you look at the business in the quarter, was it just the tough comps or was there a change in the confidence interval within the customers that kind of peeled off some of that spending? And to the degree that that continues, does that mean you have to essentially lean harder into the lending side of the equation which is clearly outperforming the rest of the business at the moment?\nJeff Campbell: Ken, let me just start by pointing out that our revenue growth was 10% in the fourth quarter which is what it was for the full year which is the same as it was in the third quarter. So from a revenue perspective, which is the end goal here, I wouldn\u2019t call it a deceleration. Now, yes, volumes decelerated a little bit because of the step up in organic growth from a year ago which if you just think about the math here. Unless you get a further step up this year, which we didn\u2019t see as you lap that, you\u2019re going to see the modest deceleration.\nSteve Squeri: Here\u2019s what I would say and quarters drive me a little bit crazy, but you look at the whole year and with $7.33 from an earnings perspective and 10%, revenue was really steady for us. And I think what\u2019s really important as a management team, we\u2019re managing for the year. You have arbitrary cutoffs which happen to be quarters. But we\u2019re really trying to manage for the entire year. We\u2019re managing those investments across the entire continuum. And the reality is, is when we see good investment opportunities we will make those investment opportunities because they\u2019re good for our shareholders in the medium and long term. So we feel \u2013 as I said, we feel great about 2018 and we feel good about the momentum that we have going into 2019.\nKen Bruce: And just in terms of leaning into credit?\nJeff Campbell: I\u2019m sorry. What\u2019s the question --?\nSteve Squeri: Leaning into credit to I guess either drive revenue, Ken?\nKen Bruce: That\u2019s correct. Yes.\nJeff Campbell: The portion of our revenues that come from net interest income were 19% for all four quarters of 2018. And in fact our lending growth slowed a little bit in Q4 because as you\u2019ve heard us say we don\u2019t set particular lending targets. We\u2019re focused on the overall customer relationship. Part of that is capturing more of our existing customers\u2019 borrowings. So there\u2019s no leaning more into lending here. You didn\u2019t see it into the fourth quarter and you won\u2019t see it in 2019.\nKen Bruce: Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll let you get back onto your rule [ph].\nJeff Campbell: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Hi. I just wanted to ask one more related to the cadence of spending just because particularly on the consumer side economists have debated for years whether or not there\u2019s a wealth effect with stock markets and consumer spending and it seems like we\u2019ve seen some evidence out of some high-end retailers of slower spending in December. But, Jeff, just to be clear when you\u2019re talking about the lapping effect, that has nothing to do with any slowdown in year-on-year activity particularly on the consumer side from billed business. It\u2019s just the effect of what happened in December 2017, right?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, I guess I\u2019d say two things. Correct. And so if the spending had fallen off in Q4 you would have seen an even bigger decline. All that said, look, let\u2019s acknowledge that the equity market volatility if you want to talk about the wealth effect within the last 10 days of the year which is kind of rounding for our quarter and people are particularly focused on shopping between Christmas and New Year\u2019s anyway. So I\u2019m not sure we have a great long period to test your theory. Clearly, we feel good about the momentum we have entering 2019 and we feel good about the guidance we gave which assumes that spending will stay reasonably strong.\nChris Donat: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thanks. We go next to Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Thanks. It seems like one of the main reasons why you saw no deceleration in revenue growth despite the slowing in billed business was that acceleration, Jeff, that you highlighted in the net card fees line. And I heard you say part of that\u2019s due to the fact that you\u2019ve been pricing for increases in value props. But you\u2019ve been doing that for the last couple of years. I\u2019m just trying to understand what caused the acceleration this quarter and kind of how sustainable is that growth going forward?\nJeff Campbell: Well, on net card fees itself we feel really good about the modest acceleration. I think it was 11% for the year and then 14% in the quarter. And what gives us confidence, Mark, in that is it\u2019s not a product or two products. We have a long multiyear playbook of history here around the world, across our many different products, across consumer and commercial of every few years you refresh the product, you increase the fee, you add more value for consumers so they think it\u2019s a great value. And we think we can keep running that playbook well into the future and that number will stay very strong. I would point out the discount revenue growth though in dollars still kind of dwarfs the net card fees in terms of offering the rest.\nSteve Squeri: The only thing that I would say, Mark, is what\u2019s really important is that continued investment in value propositions. You just can\u2019t take fee for the sake of taking fee. And what we\u2019ve really tried to do whether it\u2019s investment in lounges or in other aspects of the value proposition just not within the U.S. but across geographies and across business lines is to continue to put more value into those cards, value beyond rewards value. And that enables us to provide unique value to card members and also to be able to price for that value, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really important.\nMark DeVries: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to kind of think about or come back to the entire kind of revenue discussion and maybe offer defense of the quarterly framework because we are looking at rates of change and the rates of change do kind of vary during the year and the one that \u2013 you\u2019re going to start '19 pretty much at the rate of change that you exited '18. And as I look at it you did 10% revenue growth but you\u2019ve got slower growth in assets as you pointed out, tougher comps on the margin and tougher comps in the early part of the year in spending. And I just was wondering whether you think about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and wealthier peoples\u2019 withholdings kind of having an impact on their dilutive spending in '19 and kind of the ability to achieve that high end of the guidance range?\nSteve Squeri: I think \u2013 let me \u2013 I\u2019m going to give you a little color and then I\u2019ll ask Jeff to jump in. I think one of the things that if you look at this year which was a great year for us was cards acquired. And we invested a lot more money this year than we probably thought we would invest at the beginning of the year. And our belief is while we are growing over higher revenue growth numbers and sure you may not have sort of actually \u2013 obviously the tax cut that you had going into this year, the investments that we made this year across multiple geographies, across multiple lines of businesses to acquire card members, to provide card member treatments, to enhance those value propositions we believe that will continue to help us drive the revenue growth not to mention the tremendous investment that we continue to make in coverage not only in United States but on a global basis. And that\u2019s why discount revenue is so high for us. So we believe that investment that we made this year, the additional card members that we have and the treatments that we\u2019re providing to our card members will provide that continued momentum from a revenue perspective.\nJeff Campbell: The only thing I\u2019d add just thinking about the pure financial model is 50% of our revenue is still discount revenue. And it shouldn\u2019t escape notice if you look at Slide 12 of the slide deck that we are getting further and further from some of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last few years that have been pulling the discount rate down, the OptBlue program, regulation in the EU and Australia, some of the other strategic alliances. So for our largest revenue line we\u2019re actually entering 2019 I might argue with more momentum than we\u2019ve had in a while because discount revenue is the simple function of volume discount rate. Card fees were actually entering with more momentum as we talked about in response to Mark than we\u2019ve had in some time. So on the 80% of our revenue that I think is probably most valued by our shareholders, the fee-based revenues I see us as having really good momentum and will bring net interest income along with it.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks very much.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks, Moshe.\nOperator: We have a question from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Hi. Good evening. Thanks. So first, just curious on the expansion of merchants in the U.S., obviously a strong number. Are you seeing help from the rise in ISVs who are typically offering a flat price for all networks that I imagine is adding to the momentum that OptBlue is generating? And secondly, if you could just help us think about growth rates in professional services and the occupancy lines because they both were materially higher than I was thinking in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: So, Craig, if you look at the ISVs, the OptBlue program is embedded within, right. The objective with OptBlue was to take away any sort of arguments or issue in terms of operational or pricing that you might have from accepting American Express if you were a smaller merchant. And when the program first started out the traditional processors were in some cases offering different rates. The reality is now you\u2019re seeing not only traditional processors, ISVs and so forth and aggregators, you\u2019re seeing them offer bundled rates so it becomes a no-brainer decision for a merchant to accept all cards. And so when we started out with this program, it has now reached sort of strategically what exactly we wanted to have happen which is to take the rate conversation off the table. And I think that\u2019s it. That was the essence of OptBlue. And having it embedded in every acquirer, every aggregator that exists in the United States is what\u2019s driving that momentum and all that \u2013 we used to talk about as feet on the street. It\u2019s obviously not as much feet on the street anymore, but that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us and will drive us to as we say virtual parity coverage by the end of 2019.\nJeff Campbell: On your other question, Craig, I\u2019d remind everyone that our OpEx was flat for the year and essentially flat for the quarter. There\u2019s a little bit of P&L geography at work here. These are not the greatest names for these two lines as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Our professional services expense includes ironically some of what Steve was just talking about. So some of the fees that we pay to merchants, acquirers actually run through that line and we\u2019ve evolved the P&L geography of some of those things and that caused a little increase in that line along with some of the things we\u2019re spending on technology. Similarly, I\u2019d remind people that the line called occupancy and equipment expense not very intuitively includes amongst other things our amortization of clear costs. And as the company converts to the agile method of development, like any, call it leading-edge technology companies that\u2019s causing us to evolve some of the ways that we amortize those costs and capitalize them and that caused the spike this quarter. Again though I bring you back to OpEx overall because a lot of it is just where we tend to put the dollars is flat and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\nCraig Maurer: Okay. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hecht: Thanks, Steve and Jeff. As we entered this year I think the expectations were for some modest compression on the discount rate and it largely held fairly stable. Jeff, you mentioned the effects of OptBlue you have largely taken hold within that realm. Should we be thinking about a relatively stable discount rate this year within your guidance or is there any other factors to think about?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I\u2019d come back John to what I said in my script which is remember we are most focused on driving discount revenue and at times we make decisions that impact the average discount rate that drives discount revenue. So yes, this quarter where we only were down 1 basis point, that\u2019s because we are not seeing that much year-over-year impact anymore from any of OptBlue or EU or Australia regulation or some of the big strategic deals we cut a while back. So that\u2019s what happened in Q4. That tells you where the current trend is. We\u2019re going to get out of the business of providing forward guidance though on the average discount rate because we want the flexibility if something comes up in the world that causes us to want to do something that might drive that average down but drives discount revenue, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. So that is our focus. It\u2019s the steady kind of discount revenue growth that you saw all through 2018.\nJohn Hecht: I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Following up on the earlier question, Visa and MasterCard recently offered to reduce by as much as 40% their interregional interchange rate into the European Union at the request of the European Commission. Can you help us think about how you\u2019re going to price your product in Europe both in terms of the proprietary business and through GNS in light of these changes by Visa and MasterCard?\nSteve Squeri: Well, remember there is \u2013 when you look at the rules that are in the EU were viewed as a three-party system and Visa and MasterCard are viewed as a four-party system. To keep our three-party status, we have unwound our GNS business. So there is no pricing on our GNS business. In addition to that because we are a three-party system, we don\u2019t have the same interchange caps that exist for Visa and MasterCard. So what they did was brought their inbound traffic down to their in-market interchange rates and what our inbound and our local rates are the same. And remember that\u2019s the interchange caps. There were network fees, there were acquirer fees and those fees have actually probably expanded from a merchant perspective over time if you look and sort of look into it in detail. So, look, we price the value. We make sure that we have the appropriate premium. We have seen \u2013 as Jeff said, we saw some pressure in our discount rates not only in Australia but in Europe as a result of competitors bringing their rate down, because when there is regulation like that your value doesn\u2019t go up, your gap to \u2013 the spread that you have. And as we\u2019ve said many times on these calls, we still have a premium. Outside the United States our discount rate is still a premium and we provide a premium product and premium value and we\u2019ll continue to do that whereas in the United States we\u2019re pretty much at parity in an aggregate basis. So that\u2019s the European story.\nDavid Togut: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Hogan: It\u2019s actually Brian Hogan filling in for Bob Napoli. The question is on focus on China actually and your strategy there. One, why did you get the license ahead of Visa and MasterCard and describe your relationship with LianLian? And what\u2019s your plans then to do there going forward? How big of an opportunity is it in your mind --?\nSteve Squeri: Well, I can\u2019t answer why we got it over Visa and MasterCard. That\u2019s a question for the Chinese government. But look, we have preapproval. We are working with LianLian who we\u2019ve worked with for many years. We\u2019ve worked with them in the prepaid business and in a lot of those aspects. And from our perspective working with a partner that understands the market and working with a partner like that allows us to reduce risk, increases speed to market for us. And look, we think over the longer term it\u2019s a good opportunity for us but in the shorter term we have to get full approval, we have to build out the network, so this is not a 2019, 2020 impact to our business. And it\u2019s an ever changing political and regulatory environment and we\u2019ll just see how big this could possibly be. But we\u2019re very excited about being the only ones with the preapproval. We\u2019re excited about our partnership with LianLian and we\u2019re excited about the possibility here of working with many banks in China to issue cards and have them ride on our \u2013 in our domestic network in China over the medium to long term.\nBrian Hogan: Did you have to give up any technology for that or any rights around that?\nSteve Squeri: I\u2019m sorry. Can you say that again?\nBrian Hogan: Like the technology sharing, obviously it\u2019s under a lot of scrutiny with the tight tariffs. But did you have to give up any technology rights?\nSteve Squeri: No. We\u2019re talking about really routing transactions and this is not the most sophisticated technology in the world. We\u2019re not talking about our credit algorithms. We\u2019re not talking about our fraud algorithms. In fact, we are not issuing cards in China. So the best way to look at it is we will look exactly like Visa or MasterCard looks in the United States and in other markets. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll look in China. We are not a merchant acquirer. We are not a card issuer. We are truly a network and the technology involved in network is obviously transaction routing and just some network fraud detection and things like that. I don\u2019t want to underestimate the network technology. But certainly not as sophisticated as the technology that needs to exists to make the credit underwriting decisions that we make to make the note preset spending limit that we do to acquire customers and things like that. So that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing and that\u2019s not any of the technology that we will be sharing or plan to share.\nBrian Hogan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good evening.\nSteve Squeri: Good evening.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I just had a couple of questions. One, we talked a bit about revenue growth and the expenses in the quarter and I understand that software amortization costs are in the OpEx which is going to grow over time. I\u2019m just wondering if the expense ratio that you presented this quarter has got any kind of likely nonrecurring items or is this a level that you think over time you\u2019re going to be building towards or should we expect that you\u2019ll be driving a little bit more efficiencies as we go into next year?\nJeff Campbell: No, we feel really good Betsy about having our overall operating expenses. Within it there\u2019s some things moving our geography. But if you look at it overall it\u2019s flat year-over-year. It has been flat for several years. In fact, if you take a seven or eight-year view, it\u2019s only up a couple percent. Not as a CAGR, it\u2019s only up a couple percent. So we have a long, long track record of building upon the nature of our business model to every year get operating leverage and we see a long, long runway to continue to do that.\nBetsy Graseck: So you could just talk a little bit about whether or not the Marriott data breach or Starwood data breach had any impact and was there anything that you\u2019re planning on doing going forward to work with partners on that potential risk? And then maybe if you could just let us know based on the tax event that happened this quarter if there\u2019s any change to the outlook in tax going forward or not? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Look, as far as the Marriott data breach and I think Arne Sorenson and his team have done I think a good job communicating not only to us but communication with the general public as well. And a lot of that was from Starwood data that existed in their reservation \u2013 in their old reservation system years and years ago. And so when you look at those \u2013 if that card data was breached and there was some cards that most of the data was encrypted, we saw no appreciable spike in fraud at all. And probably we would have seen it three or four years ago because that\u2019s apparently when some of the breach occurred. So we saw nothing from that at all in our numbers. And look, this is something that is with us to stay. It\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to move as many transactions as we can to tokens and so that you take the pan out of the equation. But the reality is, is that this was not a breach that impacted us at all. And as far as \u2013 I think Jeff gave guidance on our tax rate for next year of 22%, so that\u2019s that.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We have a question from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thank you very much. Hello. Just maybe to follow up on some of the many questions that have been asked about the billed business trend. As you\u2019ve covered there\u2019s a bit of deceleration there, but that pace of deceleration is a bit more than the similar pace of deceleration in some of the marketing and acquisition-related costs. And I\u2019m wondering if that in any way addresses or raises the issue of the efficacy of those acquisition synergies?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the short answer is no. Remember, we just had a tremendous year for new card member acquisition and one of the things you\u2019ve heard all of me, Steve, Doug Buckminster in particular talk about in various forms is the tremendous gains in new card member acquisition that we\u2019re getting every year as they move to more and more digital methods and gains sophistication. So we feel really good about all of those trends. We are investing in value propositions. So when you look overall of what we call our card member engagement costs, those costs are growing faster than revenue. They did in 2017, they did in 2018 and I expect them to do so again in 2019 and that\u2019s why the operating expense leverage that we just talked about with Betsy is a really important offset to that. And that\u2019s really the financial model we\u2019re running here.\nEric Wasserstrom: And if I may just follow up on the capital commentary, Jeff, you talked about having a strong CET1 into this year\u2019s CCAR. Obviously the other thing that\u2019s going on this year is running the CECL accounting in parallel in anticipation of the implementation next year. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s early to ask for an expectation, but as you\u2019re contemplating CECL, is that going to have any influence on your appetite for capital management actions this year?\nJeff Campbell: Okay. I think you need me to make about three hypothetical assumptions there, Eric, one about what this year\u2019s CCAR process looks like; two, about what CECL does for us; and three, about how the Fed is going to react. Look, I think the short answer is CECL is not going to impact how we manage our CCAR process in this calendar year in all likelihood. We are working through CECL. I think for our credit cards, our results are liable to not be dissimilar to what you see at other banks. For charge cards, the numbers will clearly be lower. The Fed has said they will give people three years to adapt to whatever the capital impact was. And something I think you need to keep in mind for us relative to others is nobody else has the kind of ROE that we have, right? We added 200 basis points to our CET1 ratio in four quarters this year through a variety of efforts. What that means is even in the worse possible scenario of how the Fed thinks about the capital implications at CECL, for us particularly over a three-year period it is not going to be a particularly significant barrier and I don\u2019t see it having any impact this year.\nEric Wasserstrom: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe follow up a little bit on the discount rate and some of the improvements you\u2019re seeing there. It feels like those pressures that are coming from Europe and regulation as well as OptBlue seem to be moderating a little bit, but the performance this quarter actually it seem to be even better than the normal rate of deceleration that you\u2019ve seen in the gross discount rate and also I noticed the net discount rate after some of the cash back and other costs that go through actually ticked up year-over-year basis points. So is that some sort of mix issue that\u2019s helping that sort of rebound a little bit? And does that play a key role in your 2019 revenue guidance at discount rate compression we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years maybe moderating significantly? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Chris, I really wouldn\u2019t call out anything we haven\u2019t talked about which is we are getting further from some of the things that have been putting undue pressure. You\u2019re correct that mix, industry mix, geographic mix always played a little bit of a role here in the discount rate. But in some ways I\u2019ll go back to some of the comments I made to response to Moshe. We think we\u2019re going into 2019 with great momentum around discount revenue and that of course by far is our most important revenue driver and that\u2019s momentum on the volume side and frankly it\u2019s momentum in terms of our relationship with merchants and where the discount rate is.\nChris Brendler: Just to clarify, does the -- regulation stuff, like you have these contracts get renewed with merchants, is that still an ongoing headwind that you\u2019re offsetting with some of this momentum, or is that sort of to moderate a little bit as you sort of -- successfully after a couple of years of lower interchange rates in Europe and Australia sort of got into a new normal? I appreciate it, Jeff. Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think we first started about the impact \u2013 talking about the impact of European regulation two to three years ago. And we said at the time we\u2019re in no hurry to get to a new steady state, but we\u2019re certainly getting closer to it. I will say Australia moved much more quickly. And so Australia, we\u2019re probably well through the process as we enter 2019. So yes, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re saying is that not that there was never an impact, but we\u2019re just getting passed the majority or the biggest piece of it.\nChris Brendler: Fantastic. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Hi, Steve and Jeff. I had a follow up on your EPS guidance. It seems that with the revenue growth starting point of at least 8% and layering in capital return which by our math you guys can reduce the share count by about 3.5% in 2019 at the current share price assuming you maintain an 11% CET1 and then factoring in tailwinds from provision expense declining and converging with loan growth as you guys expect. And then finally some expense leverage that you guys also feel good about. You put all those pieces together that suggest that this is a very conservative EPS guidance range that you guys have given and that you\u2019ll be positioned to raise the low end of that range as we progress through the year. Am I thinking about that the right way?\nSteve Squeri: It\u2019s a lot of thinking. Look, as we look at this what\u2019s really important for us is that we continue to invest to drive top line revenue growth. And we have in our plan right now investments that we think will drive the appropriate consistent double-digit EPS growth and strong revenue growth. But we also do not have in our plan a lot of investments that we could continue to make. And so if the revenue grows even higher or to the higher end of the range, I will continue to make those investments that will continue to generate scale and more share and more relevancy which will continue to payoff in the medium to long term. So I think what\u2019s really important, Bill, is that we really start with the growth algorithm which is not starting with EPS and working down to revenue but starting with revenue and generating an EPS number for us. And I want to make this company bigger, more relevant and even more scalable than we are today and that\u2019s going to mean more cards, more coverage and more investment. And so where we are right now is to be quite honest is as far as I think I can take the investment plan without causing you guys to look at this and say, are we not making enough money. But we do have plenty of great investment opportunities that we will take advantage of if we get some more momentum in the economy and even drive revenue higher, and you\u2019ll see us make even more investments.\nBill Carcache: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Dom Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks for taking my question. Can you just quickly talk about what you\u2019re hearing from USC? It was about their expectations for commercial spending and how that may have changed over the last few months for '19?\nSteve Squeri: Yes, look, the conversations that not only we\u2019re hearing from CEOs \u2013 that I\u2019m hearing from CEOs, but more importantly what my corporate sales organization is hearing from the people that are authorizing purchases and purchasing, is there\u2019s not a pullback. So when you start to look at large corporate and large global corporate and we have pretty good insight into that, and I\u2019m not just talking about from a T&E perspective, I\u2019m just talking from an aggregate spending and that includes travel as well, but we don\u2019t see any pullback on the horizon. I have a lot of opportunities to spend time with the number of CEOs. And the reality is, is that they\u2019re not contemplating a pullback. And so if the people that are spending the money are not contemplating a pullback, that gives me great confidence, especially from a commercial perspective because if they pullback it then dribbles down to middle market companies and small businesses and obviously then to consumers. But we don\u2019t see that happening. And I haven\u2019t heard any of that conversation. In fact, I\u2019ve heard just the opposite from purchasing managers who are making those decisions.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks so much.\nEdmund Reese: So with that, we\u2019ll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve, and thank you, Jeff. As you may have seen in our press release, we will be hosting an Investor Day on March 13th and look forward to seeing many of you then.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And I\u2019ll now turn the meeting over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Edmund Reese. Please go ahead, sir.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Lori. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the third quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings materials from prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of Q3 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results, with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Edmund and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with some of the key highlights from the third quarter results we released earlier this afternoon. From there, I'll give an overview of the year-to-date results. And before turning it over to Jeff for a more detailed discussion of our financial performance, I\u2019ll provide a quick progress report on the four strategic imperatives that we focused the organization on at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, we saw a continued momentum in our business that was in line with the strong growth of the first half. Adjusted revenues grew 10% and we delivered EPS of $1.88. I feel really good about the company's performance. We\u2019ve had several quarters of high revenue growth and in fact this marks the sixth consecutive quarter with adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%. Our growth has been broad based, driven by a well balanced mix of card member spending, fees and loans and spread across geographies, businesses and customer segments. We have continued to control our operating expenses and that provides the flexibility to make investments in our brand, customer benefits and digital capabilities. As I reflect on the first nine months of the year, I see very consistent and positive trends. We generated a healthy level of top line revenue growth and delivered strong bottom line results each quarter. Year-to-date, our revenue growth is 10% and our earnings per share growth is slightly higher than that, after adjusting for the tax act of 2017. We're gaining spending and lending share in almost all the countries in which we operate. At the same time, our customer engagement expenses, which are composed of rewards, card member services and marketing are growing a little faster than revenue. We are seeing very good payback from the targeted enhancements we've made to our customer value propositions. But that does translate into some margin pressure. The remainder of our cost on operating expenses. For us, these are primarily scalable infrastructure costs and they are growing at a much slower rate than revenues. So in effect, the margin compression created by higher customer engagement expenses is being partially offset by OpEx leverage. And as many of you know, we have a proven track record of disciplined control on operating expenses, while growing the rest of the business.  We're delivering strong results in a highly competitive and regulated environment where there are higher costs associated with driving growth. And going forward, we are focused on sustaining the high levels of revenue growth that have been delivering steady and consistent double digit EPS growth. We believe that the best way to do that is to invest in share, scale and relevance for the long term. Turning back to our year-to-date performance, we feel good about the advantages that come from our integrated business model and the progress we're making on our four strategic imperatives, which I'll take you through now. We continue to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space. We introduced the new Gold Card in the US with an enhanced value proposition and an innovative set of rewards. We continued to refresh our international product line with enhancements to our Platinum Card in Australia, Singapore in Japan.  The US Platinum Card continued its strong performance. New consumer accounts are up more than 50% and about half of those are for millennials. Building on our strong position in commercial payments, small and medium sized businesses continue to be our fastest growing customer segment worldwide, with particular strength in our international regions. Continuing to strengthen our global integrated network, we continue to add more places worldwide, where American Express cards are accepted. While I could expand much more in our progress in these first three areas, today, I want to focus more on our fourth priority, making American Express a more essential part of our customers\u2019 digital lives. Given the announcement we made earlier today about an expanded relationship with PayPal, I wanted to put the many things we are doing here in context. Over the past year, we've steadily gained traction on this critical imperative that cuts across every part of our integrated business model. Our progress on our digital efforts takes many forms. Acquiring companies with great technology and AI capabilities like Mezi and Cake and working to integrate those capabilities into our app, creating partnerships with a range of innovative startups to stay on the leading edge of exploring new capabilities for our customers, steadily expanding our internal capabilities through new and innovative products, such as Early Pay and Amex Gold for our commercial products, continuing to drive working efficiencies by having more of our marketing and new card member acquisitions come through our digital channels and building upon our longstanding relationship with a digital leader like Amazon and our strength in small business to come together and launch later this quarter what we believe will grow to be one of our leading small business co-brands in the US. And so like we are excited to expand our longstanding relationship with a digital leader like Amazon, I am also excited about expanding our longstanding relationship with another digital leader, PayPal. PayPal and long been one of our largest merchants and most important partners, helping to expand the reach of our digital payments in the American Express network and I'm really excited about what we're doing together. As part of our expanded relationship, card members will be able to use membership rewards points for purchases at millions of PayPal merchants online and send money via Venmo or PayPal to friends and family directly from the Amex mobile app easily at American Express card to the Pay Pal wallet directly from the mobile app or website from Amex\u2019s mobile app or website and pay their American Express bill with their PayPal or Venmo balance via the PayPal instant transfer features. We\u2019ll have a more prominent place on the platform and we\u2019ll continue to jointly explore additional innovative digital products and experiences. I believe this is going to be a winning partnership for our customers, for our merchants, for us and for PayPal. It's truly a win-win. And as I see it, it is just the latest step in our journey to play a more essential role in the digital lives of our customers. As I said at the start, I feel very good about our performance. The investments we've made in new benefits, services, digital capabilities and the global marketing campaign that supports them are generating very good momentum. Given that momentum, we now expect full year 2018 revenue growth to be between 9% and 10% and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 to $7.40, up from $6.90 to $7.30 range we set at the start of the year. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s good to be here today to talk about another quarter of steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth. But to get right into our summary financials on slide 3. Third quarter revenues of $10.1 billion grew 10% on an FX adjusted basis, with this growth again driven by a well balanced mix of growth across discount revenue, fee revenue and net interest income. I would point out that the FX adjusted growth rate now exceeds our reported growth of 9%, given the strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies in which we operate. This 10% revenue growth then drove net income of $1.7 billion, up 22% from a year ago and earnings per share was $1.88 for the quarter, up 25% from the prior year. Our shares outstanding were down 2% from the prior year, a little less than recent quarters due to the suspension of our share repurchases in the first half of the year, which resulted from the one-time impact of the tax act last December. We are now back within our targeted capital level range and as a result, resumed share buybacks this quarter. All in, these are results we feel really good about. Looking at the details of our performance, I\u2019ll start with billed business, which you see several reviews of on slides 4 through 6. Starting on slide 4, our FX adjusted total billings growth accelerated sequentially to 10% in Q3. More significantly, as you can see on the top right, our proprietary business, which makes up 80% or the majority of our total billings, was up 12%, maintaining very strong growth levels. The remaining 15% of our overall billings, which come from our network business, GNS, continues to see the expected impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia and as a result, GNS billings were down 1% on an FX adjusted basis. The steady and strong growth across all of our proprietary segments is shown clearly as you turn to slide 5, which gives you a segment oriented view of our billings.  Turning to slide 6, we have a more detailed view of billings by customer segment. And also a reminder, the global commercial and global consumer are roughly the same size, representing 41% and 44% of Q3 billings respectively, while global network services makes up the remaining 15% billings. Starting on the left, with our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, US SME was up 10%. As the leader in the US SME space, we feel good about the consistently strong billings growth that we have shown for many years in this customer segment. International SME remains our highest growth customer segment with 23% FX adjusted growth in the third quarter. Our growth in this segment has accelerated significantly in the last year and we continue to believe that we have a long runway for growth, given the low penetration we see in the top countries where we offer international small business products. In the large and global customer segment, we saw a 10% growth on an FX adjusted basis. As you know, this is an important segment for us as it helps strengthen our network by driving acceptance and coverage. Now, on any given quarter, our growth rate in this segment can vary a bit, given the large volumes that a few customers can drive. This segment is heavily T&E oriented and you can see in the earnings table that the company's overall US T&E and global airline billings also accelerated sequentially to 9% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter. Moving to US consumer, which made up 32% of the company's billings in the third quarter, we are pleased to report our third consecutive quarter with double digit growth. Our double digit billings growth in US consumer reflects our strong acquisition efforts through digital channels as well as the general strength we're seeing in consumer spending and confidence within our premium US consumer base. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remains high at 18% on an FX adjusted basis, consistent with Q2. We have widespread growth in key markets with FX adjusted growth of 13% in Japan, 14% in Mexico and over 20% in both Australia and the UK. Last, on the right, as I mentioned earlier, global network services was down 1% on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia.  Although the network billings are down in these regions, we are seeing strong growth on the proprietary side as I just mentioned. Additionally, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia markets, the remaining portion of GNS was up 8%. Overall, our growth has been diverse and this is the first quarter in some time in which we have had double digit billings growth across all of our proprietary groups. US and international SME and consumer as well as large and global corporate. Turning next to loan performance on slide 7. Total loan growth was 16% in the third quarter and in line with the prior few quarters. We continue to be focused on driving growth with our existing customers and about 60% of our growth in lending came from existing customers once again this quarter. I would remind you that we completed the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year, which contributed around 120 basis points to growth this quarter, roughly in line with the contribution to growth in the first half of the year. On the right hand side of slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.8%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. As we have been saying for some time, we have expected net interest yield to stabilize, which would cause year-over-year growth to moderate. You are clearly seeing that playing out over the last few quarters. While net yield is still growing over the prior year, the increase continues to moderate, as we lap some of our pricing initiatives. To spend a minute on funding, I\u2019d remind you that over half of our funding comes from deposits and over half of our deposits are in our online personal savings program. We resumed actively growing our online personal savings program this year and in a rising rate environment, it is generally our least expensive source of funding. Our beta on this program has been around 0.7 of late, consistent with the assumption we use for internal planning. Stepping back, while we view a rising rate environment as a modest headwind to us, it is usually mitigated by a stronger economic environment, which is certainly what we are seeing now.  Turning next to the credit metrics, on slide nine, on the left side, you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.1%, up 30 basis points from the prior year and stable on a sequential basis. As a reminder, we have been saying for some time now that we expect these rates to gradually increase, as they have and in fact the rates continue to be slightly better than we expected for this year. On the bottom left, we have added delinquency rates, which you can see have been relatively stable now for several quarters. On the right side, you can see similar metrics on our charge portfolio. The charge write-off rate, excluding GCP, was 1.7% in the third quarter, up 20 basis points from a year ago, but down on a sequential basis. Here, I'd remind you that there can be some quarterly volatility in these charge rates due to seasonality and looking forward, we do not see anything in the performance of our tenured customers to suggest any change in the broader environment. Turning next to provision on slide 8, provision was $817 million. I would point out that our reserve build was $92 million this quarter versus $229 million in the third quarter of 2017. And I also remind you that the third quarter of 2017 reserve build took into account a number of factors at the time, including recent hurricanes, accelerating loan growth and seasoning in the portfolio. For this year, as you just saw on the prior slide, the delinquency rates have remained relatively stable for several quarters, so that is what you see reflected in our reserve build this quarter. Based on our year to date performance, we are now lowering our full year provision growth expectation from the mid-30% range to less than 30%. We feel good about our ability to continue growing our lending a bit faster than the industry, by focusing on our existing customers, while retaining best-in-class credit metrics. Turning now to revenues on slide 10, FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter. As Steve mentioned, this represents the sixth straight quarter of having adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%, driven by steady growth from a well balanced mix of spending fees and lending. On slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. Discount revenue, which makes up 61% of our revenue was up 8% on a reported basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees growth was 11%, driven by growth in Platinum and Delta in the US as well as growth in key international markets like Japan and Australia. We continue to demonstrate the ability to generate card fee revenues by offering differentiated value propositions, even in the face of the steady competitive challenges that others present. Lastly, net interest income was up 17%, driven primarily by the growth in loans that I mentioned a few moments ago.  Turning now to slide 12 to cover the largest and most important component of our revenue, discount revenue. Starting on the left, our average discount rate in Q3 was 2.38%. This is down just 2 basis points from a year ago, a much smaller decline than we have been seeing in recent quarters. For some time now, we have been talking about how there were several factors driving a larger decline in the average discount rate that we did expect to fade over time.  These factors included the impact of regulatory changes in Europe and Australia, the continued rollout of our [indiscernible] program to drive toward superiority merchant coverage in the US and some impacts from decisions we made to deepen the broad relationships we have with certain strategic partners. You see this quarter that these impacts are indeed beginning to moderate. In addition, mix also plays an important role in our average discount rate and the higher growth in travel and entertainment spending this quarter that I discussed earlier also helped the average discount rate. As a result, we now expect the average discount rate for the full year to be down less than the 5 to 6 basis point expectation that we originally shared at our March Investor Day. Moving beyond the discount rate and really more importantly, for many quarters, you\u2019ve heard us say that our main focus is on driving discount revenue growth, not managing to an average discount rate. And what you see on the right hand side of page 12 is that discount revenue growth was up 9% on an FX adjusted basis. This represents the highest FX adjusted growth rate on discount revenue that we have shown since 2012. And we feel really good about the momentum in our largest, and most critical revenue line. Turning now to expenses on slide 13, let me start with operating expenses, which were down 1% this quarter, while there were a number of discrete items that impacted the growth rate in both the current and prior year. If you were to adjust for all the various discrete charges, we would have seen a modest increase in operating expenses from the prior year, consistent with our long standing trend of getting operating expense leverage relative to our revenue growth. We continue, as Steve said, to have great confidence in our ability to deliver steady operating expense leverage. So that brings me next to customer engagement costs on slide 14. In total, customer engagement expenses were 4.5 billion in the third quarter, up 13% from the prior year. Starting at the bottom, we have the marketing and business development line, which has two components. Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co brand partners. This line in total is up 14% versus the prior year, driven by two factors. First, as we've said for the last few quarters, we have some increases in partner payments due to co-brand agreements that we signed in the last year and growth in our corporate business. Second, as you may recall, we launched a new global brand campaign earlier this year and as you would expect, we increased our spending in marketing to support our brand refresh. I would add that we feel good about our continued ability to drive marketing efficiencies in our card member acquisition efforts. As we have grown our acquisitions to 3 million new proprietary cards globally this quarter, without a corresponding increase in our levels of direct spending. This marks our highest quarter of acquisition in many years, when you set aside the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year.  Moving up to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 11% from the prior year, roughly in line with proprietary billings growth. Moving then to the top of the slide, card member services cost was up 30% in the third quarter. We continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of the differentiated value propositions, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits. Turning last to capital on slide 15, you can see that we ended Q3 with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%. Our high ROE business model has allowed us to quickly rebuild our capital levels to our target range of having a 10% to 11% CET1 ratio after last December's Tax Act charge briefly dropped us below our target range. This has allowed us to resume share repurchases in Q3 and to raise our dividend, consistent with the CCAR approvals we received from [indiscernible] in June. So that brings us to our outlook and then we'll open the call for questions. First, we now expect full year revenue growth to be 9% to 10%. As both Steve and I have pointed out, our revenue growth has been at least 8% on an adjusted basis for six consecutive quarters and that strong growth has been driven across a diverse mix of both geographies as well as business and customer segments. We can directly link our decisions and investments to the strong revenue growth that we have seen year-to-date and we will continue to make investments that we believe will drive share, scale and relevance and will sustain our strong level of revenue growth.  Our confidence in this revenue growth leads us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 to $7.40, excluding any potential discrete tax benefits and other contingencies. This is up from our original guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. Taking a step back, our performance year to date and full year guidance reinforce several points that Steve let off with. First, over the last several quarters, we have had strong revenue growth and tax adjusted earnings per share growth, slightly above that, as we offset some of the increased customer engagement costs with operating expense leverage. Second, while our business model has the flexibility to throttle back spending on value propositions and card member engagement in ways that contribute to EPS in the short term, we believe that our decisions today are driving share, scale and relevance, which support the business over the long term. Finally, we are focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth, which we believe is the best way to generate steady and consistent double digit EPS growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Edmund to begin the Q&A session.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation and with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: [Technical Difficulty] And it seems like the growth is diverse and accelerated \u2013 \nSteve Squeri: Hey, Sanjay. You cut out for a minute, so would you mind starting again?\nSanjay Sakhrani: Absolutely. Okay. Good. So the revenues have been consistently surpassing your expectations this year and it seems like the growth is diverse and accelerating. Could you guys talk about where specifically the outperformance is coming from, is it macro, is it investments, is it a favorable competitive environment and what gives you the confidence that it's going to persist? And then just on a related note, on the discount rate, Jeff, you mentioned that you expected to not be down as much as you guys envisioned. So what would be the trajectory going forward, given there's not as many of these partnership discounts or anything else sort of affecting that number?\nSteve Squeri: So, Sanjay, let me sort of start out and maybe get the first part of the question. Look, what we have really focused on, and not just this year, but over the last couple of years, is we've really focused in on investing. We've invested in value for our card members. We've really invested in value propositions and we've certainly invested in coverage. And Jeff will talk about sort of discount rate, but you've seen discount revenue. But when you look at the -- you look at our growth, it's across the board.  You've got double digit growth in every billing segment that we report with the exception of GNS, which has the issues as we wind down Australia, wind down Europe, but whether it's small and middle market in the US, even large and global accounts, certainly, international, both consumer and small business was really high double digit and double digit growth rates and with SME up in the 20% and US consumer as well and, look, we continue to grow our lending book judiciously, not only in the US, but in international.  So, I think, we\u2019ve spoken in times that, maybe from an organic perspective, there is a little bit of the economy, but certainly, we believe that the investments that we're making are really driving this sustainable, what we believe, is sustainable growth. And we believe our value propositions are resonating with what would be our traditional customers and what I think a lot of people are surprised at as millennials. And so it really is across the board growth.\nJeff Campbell: The only thing I'd add on that, Sanjay and then I\u2019ll talk about discount rate is, we did talk going actually all the way back to the January call, about the fact that late in last year's fourth quarter, we did see a noticeable uptick in what we would call organic growth and we really can't particularly attribute that last little uptick to anything other than the economy and it\u2019s sustained itself this year, though not further accelerated. So, there's a modest boost from economic growth, but I think all of the factors Steve talked about are the much larger drivers for us. On discount rate, Sanjay, you have enough history to know that for many years, we used to talk about a 2 to 3 basis point a year decline and this average, discount rate due to mix, people hitting volume triggers, et cetera. In fact, if you look at history, it was used in more 1 to 2. And then for a couple of years now, we've said because of [indiscernible], because of regulation in Europe and Australia, because of a few strategic agreements we've done, that has driven it down an unusual amount, but all those you see this quarter are beginning to fade. Now, I'm not going to give you guidance for the future beyond that, because I think Steve and I have been very clear this year that our focus is on driving discount revenue growth and so we're going to make decisions sometimes that leverage our integrated business model, if we think they're going to drive discount revenue growth and we're not going to worry about the average discount rate. What I would say is, we feel good within any given category of merchants about the stability of the rates and about where we are.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: If I look at sort of forecasted revenue estimates, they\u2019re probably around a seven handle, yet you guys are doing a 9, 10. And so I guess the question is, on sustainability. So you talked a little bit about billed business, but you're facing tougher comps on proprietary, yet easier on GNS. I guess, my question is, can your billed business growth accelerate or is it more likely that we've peaked out here.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I\u2019ll make a few comments and then Steve you can add. Look, I think, Steve and I couldn\u2019t have been clear about the focus we have on sustaining the kind of revenue growth that you have now seen for six consecutive quarters. And of course, that revenue growth is coming from a mixture of great billings growth, steady loan growth, steady growth in all the fees that we generate and the key to sustaining the overall revenue growth we have is we see a long runway to sustain growth in all three areas. So I would say, we're not particularly trying to drive or forecast or suggest acceleration from where we are. We feel really good about the share and scale gains that we're getting with our performance right now and that's what we\u2019re focused on sustaining.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. Look, I think what we have said is, we have lots of great investment opportunities and we're going to take advantage of those investment opportunities and those opportunities are not only within our commercial business and consumer business, but they\u2019re broad based. And so what you will continue to see us do is investing in card acquisition and you will continue to see a focus on investing and coverage. And we believe that, as we have invested in coverage here in the United States, it has made a huge difference and you\u2019re seeing that play out in discount, you've seen that play out in billed business growth and you\u2019ve seen that played out in discount revenue growth and we're not at where we want to be, even in the United States at this particular point in time, as we've said, we want to get to virtual parity coverage by the end of 2019.  And so, you will continue to see us focus there and you continue to see us focus internationally on coverage, which there is a relationship between improved coverage and driving billed business and the more billed business if you think about our spend centric model, then you actually can drive -- continue to drive the revenue growth that we're also getting from lending. So bottom line is, we're going to be investing for share and for scale, as we continue moving forward.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jill Shea with Citi.\nJill Shea: Related to billed business from large and corporate customers, you saw some accelerating trends there. Can you just speak to the strength and how should we think about growth going forward and then perhaps also touch on airline in US T&E and the strength that you saw this quarter and how we should think about the outlook going forward there?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. I think for large and global, it was a particularly good quarter. I think, there are some -- we will have some grow over issues as we move forward. But what you're seeing is a little bit more diversification in terms of we're getting some more B2B within that space. But we also continue to see our large corporates and our global accounts continue to spend in the T&E space. So we're really happy with the sort of the double digit growth. It's not something that we've experienced in quite a while. In fact, if you go back a few quarters, you saw this sort of at a 2% level, at a negative level and we've had that uptick, partially due our focus on B2B, but also due to increased T&E spending with our large and corporate accounts.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to change conversation a little bit and talk about the very fast loan growth that you\u2019ve been generating with strong credit quality. A little bit of an uptick in net charge-offs, but not that much. And related to how you're thinking about reserving as we go into the CECL world, really the question has to do with the fact that you've got obviously a lot of transactors, does that mean that you could potentially pull back on some of the reserving that you're doing and drive that into even faster loan growth or potentially buybacks or is that not part of the equation and if you could speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the new accounting world and when we'd be getting some information with regard to how that's going to impact you would be helpful?\nSteve Squeri: So let me first just remind you, we're now four years into growing a little faster than the industry, because of our unique focus on capturing a bigger share of our own customers\u2019 borrowing behaviors, which frankly we've historically under penetrated and that's why we have sixty percent of our loan growth coming from our existing customer base. I point out if take that growth out, you'd be growing at about at the industry. It's why four years into this exercise, we still buy quite a stretch the best in class credit metrics and credit has consistently performed. As we have told people, it would, so we feel really good about the growth and we actually think we have a very, very long runway to continue to grow a little faster than the industry. On CECL, Betsy, I'm afraid, I'm not going to give you a lot of insights that are much different from what others have said. If you look at our card lending look, I would suggest that you are liable to see larger reserves that are somewhere in the range of what you've heard others talk about somewhere in the 10%, 20%, maybe a little higher percent range. What is unique about us, as you point out, is we are the only financial institution in the world that has a really large charge card franchise that obviously has some different dynamics in the CECL world. Frankly, we're still working through that partly because of our uniqueness. There's a lot to work through with regulators and auditors and accounting authorities.  The net of all that, we\u2019ll have to see. I guess I will go on record as saying we're one of the great majority of financial institutions who think that there is incredible complexity to this accounting standard. There's probably also some pro-cyclicality which may be the opposite of what the regulators set out to accomplish when they went down this path. And, we'll have to see what that means overall.  We\u2019d also hope, but boy, it's way too early to say that this is a pure accounting change, which you would think shouldn't effect ratings, shouldn't affect capital requirements, although there are certainly no commitments out there right now from the Fed or the rating agencies to in fact take that approach. So, I think there's still a lot of discussion to have on this, Betsy. And I actually see that discussion growing a little bit in the industry as well as in DC. I will say like most other institutions, in 2019, we'll be running parallel and that's really when we'll be able to give people more specific insights.\nOperator: And we'll go next to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Cyganovich: Hi, good evening. This is Anthony Cyganovich on behalf of David Togut. Do you expect to reduce merchant discount rates further in Europe as PST 2 [ph] goes into effect in Continental Europe next year which may promote more ACH based payment?\nSteve Squeri: So, look, as we look at Europe, as you know we're outside of the regulation but our competitors aren't and so we still have a premium. Our business in Europe is very different. It is a corporate card SME, really high end consumer business which merchants value and when you look at that business, that's a business that's grown in the high high-double digits at this particular point for us all across the board, international and in Europe. So I don't see that happening and I don't see us having actually the exact same coverage needs that we do in the United States, but what we will do is we will use discount rate as a tool to provide coverage where we need coverage whether that be B2B, where there is a different value equation. And remember again here is where the integrated model helps us out because we have both sides of that equation and especially in Europe because we're not able to use sort of the same models we have in the United States and as we need small merchants, we may run our own what I\u2019d call our own theoretical ARPU program here from a pricing perspective, but other than that I don't see us -- I see us maintaining that premium. And again I wouldn't look at that as it relates and we don't share this obviously but I wouldn\u2019t look at that as it relates to the discount rate in Europe. I would look at us using that discount rate as a tool to get coverage when and where we need it.\nOperator: We have a question from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And nice job on the quarter. The international semi and consumer businesses continued to grow at a very high rate. What is specifically driving that? I think it's still relatively small relative to the opportunity. Are we early days and what is driving that and if I could, the Amazon program, how are you going to manage that with all the other SMB programs, small business programs you have in the US? How does that fit in and compete with your other programs.\nSteve Squeri: Let me go with the second one first here. I think we'll be launching the Amazon product soon. And we have a range of \u2013 look, we have a range of small business products. We have a Delta co-brand, a Hilton co-brand, a Marriott co-brand, a Lowe's co-brand and now we have an Amazon c-brand and in addition to proprietary products and the proprietary products whether those be cash back with charge products or what have you and a lot of our customers actually use multiple products. You will see small businesses that use a corporate card product, you will see small businesses that use a Marriott product and use an Amex simply cash product. And I think the beauty of the Amazon and Delta, Marriott and so forth and so on is that we provide small businesses the opportunity to use the variety of products that meet their needs and meets their rewards needs and spending needs and so forth. And so our view is I'd rather have that sort of arsenal of products all under the American Express umbrella than certainly have to compete there. And it'll be -- you may see customers that have our small business product today, also get the Amazon product just like they also got to Marriott product. And so I just think it's one of the ways that we will continue to drive our billings and drive our position in commercial payments in the US. As far as your first question, when you look at the SME segment internationally and then I'll get into consumer, when you look at the SME segment internationally which is a relatively newer segment that is being penetrated here is the vantages of global scale. What we're able to do is leverage our global infrastructure, leverage our global footprint, leverage everything that we have in our commercial business in the United States and our global business outside the United States and we've been driving that business and the way we drive that business is we drive it in multiple ways. We drive that from a telesales perspective and in-person sales perspective and a digital perspective. And the reality is, we see that as a large growth opportunity and when you look at that business for us, right now we are growing that primarily on from a billings perspective but over time there will be a working capital component we believe to that base that we have. From a consumer perspective, American Express has been a premium product brand outside the United States for many years and, look, we are continuing to inject value and what\u2019s really interesting about our business outside the United States is that in a lot of places or in a lot of cases our fees that we charge to our consumers are actually higher than they are in the United States and the services that we provide are on par even or even better. So we see that opportunity still as a growth opportunity for us and as we continue to increase the coverage we believe spending will increase as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: Hi. Let me echo the congratulations. It\u2019s James at Susquehanna. Since you called it out Steve, I just wanted to probe about the trend in the leverage and the margin trajectory especially with regard to card member services. Just kind of philosophically I realize you conclude that it's a good area of investment but I'm just getting questions from investors at what point will it likely stabilize because 30% is a pretty big ticket? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Let me make a financial comment, Steve and then you can cover on the strategy. One caution James and one for you and really for everyone is we pull different levers at different times in different geographies and different parts of our business. And one of the reasons why we flipped a while back to talking broadly about card member engagement costs which includes rewards, which includes business development, payments to partners, traditional marketing and it includes cost of card member services, although I would point out that's by far the smallest component is because at different times the growth rates are going to vary across those three depending on what we think is going to produce best return. So I encourage you to look in many ways across all three of those categories, but we've been pretty clear today that, look, those have been growing a little faster than revenue. But we actually feel great about the revenue growth that that's generating. We feel great about the platform that provides a pretty steady double digit EPS growth and we think it is allowing us to build scale and relevance in a way that quite frankly we haven\u2019t in a number of years.\nSteve Squeri: I think it really gets down to how we inject value and I think Jeff is right. I mean, we look at multiple levers to do that and I think as we continue to get more customers, as we continue to get more of their billings, it provides that platform to do more things with them as we continue to develop more and more products and services. So again our strategy here is really about more share, really about more relevance and really about more scale and we believe that's the right lever for us to pull at this particular point in time.\nOperator: And we go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Wanted to talk about the reserving, because obviously very strong results both in -- somewhat in Q2, but even more so in Q3 and you did lower your expectations for the full year. How do we think about it going into \u201919 just because the portfolio is obviously growing at a fairly high rate and while credit ratios are good, the dollar amounts of both delinquencies and loss are growing? And I guess how do we think about that into \u201919?\nJeff Campbell: Well, you know, we will have to give you a, of course, much more thorough answer in 90 days when we are on the January call and will provide a lot of commentary on 2019. But, look, I\u2019d make a few comments. As you very well understand, provision is affected by a lot of things including sequential rates of growth in your loan. So in a world though where, let's say, our loan growth in 2019 roughly looks like where it is today. I think what you're seeing in our trends of late is we're getting past some of the more dramatic seasoning that we had to get go through and we're starting to get to the point where your provision growth will begin to asymptote down, all else being equal, towards your loan growth rate. Now we are growing loans in the mid-teens, so that tells you that you should expect the provision to at least grow at that level even as we maintain the kind of credit performance that we've had. But we feel really good about the economics we've been getting from four years of growing lender a little faster than the industry but I think we can do this in the current kind of economic climate for many years to come.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Guys, thanks for taking my question. You guys have articulated and really executed on a wallet share driven loan growth strategy. I am curious if there are any differences in how season customers build balances and if there is any more sort of concentration in terms of transaction, higher utilization initially or how we think about season in future growth given that this portfolio could be constructed a little bit differently.\nJeff Campbell: I think, Rick, the thing that I always keep trying to bring people back to is, historically our customers don't think of American Express as a place to do their borrowing on a card and that's why Doug Buckminster, Steve, myself, we talk a lot about the statistic in the US consumer segment which is where most of our lending is, that we capture roughly 50% of our customers spending behaviors and only 25% of their borrowing behavior. So what we have consistently worked at now for the last few years is trying to do lots of different things in marketing and product and pricing, in incentives to try to change that mindset and that's why 60% of our loan growth is coming from our existing customers, it's why we're able to keep credit metrics at the levels that I was just talking about in response to Moshe's question and it's why we think we can keep at this for a long time.\nSteve Squeri: The only thing I would say is that and I've said this before in meetings and at our analysts calls and so forth it is important for us to have a broader relationship with our customers and if they're going to go and borrow money someplace else, that also provides the possibility of them spending someplace else as well. So it really is important, which is why it is important for us from a small business perspective to continue to talk about and expand what we're doing with small businesses whether that\u2019d be cross border payments, whether that be merchant financing, 90 day working capital loans and things like that because they do have other options and it really is important especially in a world where things are still accessible from a digital perspective that they don't look at us as a one trick pony and that they're looking at us as a source of their -- and look, this applies from a small business perspective and a consumer perspective as a source of their working capital needs and that's what we're really trying to do and so that's why the sort of messaging. And you see this a little bit with some of our advertising. When you look at it and you see somebody applying for a loan, a small loan online as they're watching TV, so you're going to continue to see us expand what we're doing with our customers.\nRick Shane: Got it. And again I'm just sort of curious, presumably a seasoned American Express customer has a different balance build behavior than a millennial and that totally makes sense. I'm trying to understand what the implications are in terms of future growth if we should think about how those loans season and then no judgments one way or the other, better, worse, fast or slower but how we think about the difference in terms of how that initial entry behavior translates into long term performance.\nSteve Squeri: I guess, Rick, I am going to come back to, remember the diversity of our product portfolio US, international, consumer, small business, lots of different cards, people borrow on the platinum card, they borrow on every day cards, those kinds of generalizations. I am just not sure we -- frankly we don't look at the world that way because of the diversity of our base. I'm just going to come back to, we see a long runway to continue what we're doing here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Thanks. Coming back to the topic of the relationship between your revenue growth, engagement expenses and the EPS, I think you indicated given the faster engagement expense, you were saying EPS growth adjusted for the tax benefits, it's slightly ahead of the revenue growth and I think you know the Amex of all, kind of reliably expect that a mid to high single digit revenue growth to translate into kind of a mid-teens EPS growth. Would you expect to widen back out to that kind of relationship over time or do you see that kind of margin pressure persisting?\nJeff Campbell: Well, Mark, it\u2019s a very good question and let me just maybe be clear with everyone. So Steve and I were very clear on the call that we are focused on sustaining the kind of high levels of revenue growth we have. We think we have a good runway to do that and we think it's a great basis to produce double digit EPS growth. If you look at Q2 and Q3, though, just to look at some actual results and there's a little complexity to the taking out the impact of the Tax Act. But if you do take the impact of the Tax Act out, you see 9% to 10% EPS growth in those two quarters and you see 10% to 12% EPS growth excluding the impact of the tax. In history, to your point, 2012 to 2014 we were getting very little revenue growth, 4%, frankly losing share, losing some scale. But we\u2019ve squeezed 11% EPS growth out of that. Pre-crisis, you saw some numbers like that. We don't think that's the right way to run the company in the current competitive and regulatory environment. We don't think that produces the kind of sustainable foundation. It\u2019s going to build scale and relevance and share that will allow us to really sustain double digital EPS growth.\nSteve Squeri: The Amex of old, the Amex of today, from a numbers perspective, we're in a very different environment as Jeff just said. We're in a different environment competitively, we're in a different environment from a regulatory perspective. We're in different mindset too though and I think that mindset that we have is it is really important that we continue to grow our share and we continue to grow our relevance and scale. And you don't need any more proof of that than what we've been doing from a coverage perspective and just how important it is. And what we've been doing from a value injection perspective with our card members and so we're going to continue to do that as well as continue to build capabilities so that we can expand our relationships with them. So we believe the right way to win is to really focus in as we both said, on higher revenue growth with a narrowing of that revenue and that EPS number, but just to point out, it is with a lot higher revenue growth.\nOperator: And we go to Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening. Hi, Steve and Jeff. I had a follow up on Moshe's question earlier. Credit has held up much better than many expected with Amex never really facing the severe normalization headwinds that some of your lend centric competitors did. Can you help us understand the role that your closed loop things like machine learning and other technologies have played in driving your strong credit performance and maybe speak to the extent to which you think those assets provide you guys with an edge over your competitor swap rate in an open loop environment?\nJeff Campbell: Other than if you look at sort of blip during the credit crisis, the financial crisis, the closed loops is a secret sauce. It is the secret sauce from a fraud perspective, it is a secret sauce from an underwriting perspective, it's a secret sauce from a targeting perspective upfront and who you acquire. And reality is that good credit starts right at the beginning of the funnel in terms of who you're targeting, who you're letting in, how much money you're lending and all of that is all about sort of how we continue to invest in our machine learning capabilities and our data capabilities and all that's really powered by the closed loop and all the data that we have. So it has been a tremendous advantage for us from day one. The other thing I will add on this is that the other thing that's really important within the closed loop which absolutely has nothing to do with the closed loop is preset spending limit. And so when we look at our machine learning capability, it also helps to drive just how we set that no preset spending limit. And one of the huge advantages that we have is in small business space because in the small business space, small businesses use credit card products as a form of working capital whether it\u2019s charge or whether it's lending and to be able to set a no preset spending limit where we are dynamically determining what the level of spend is based upon data from millions of small businesses and historical data and so forth is a huge advantage to us as well. So, look, there's many models that are out there in this business. There is a PayPal model, Visa, MasterCard model, there is JPMorgan Chase model. Our model is unique and the uniqueness is, it\u2019s integrated. That integration gives you the closed loop, the closed loop gives you data, it gives you relationships on either side and it gives you the ability to have the -- to play with the economics which becomes even more important down the road from a B2B perspective. So closed loop is key for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJeff Cantwell: Can you talk a little more about today's announcement with PayPal? I guess what I'm curious about is how much opportunity is there for Amex card holders who might be interested in using Amex rewards points for purchases at the PayPal merchants online. Maybe tell us why this is something where you think you'll see a lot of demand from your card holders. Just a related question. How eager are Amex card holders to add their Amex cards to the PayPal wallet through the mobile app or the website and then start to spend via the wallet? I'm really just trying to get a framework for how incremental this might be for you.\nSteve Squeri: So, look, I think what you saw today really is a multifaceted expansion of our relationship with PayPal our relationship with PayPal goes way back. They are a huge partner of ours from a acquiring merchant perspective, they're a leader in the digital space. I think that's very, very clear. My perspective is it always made sense for us to sort of expand our relationship with them and, look, Dan and the team are really great to work with. I have a long term relationship with Dan. We worked really well together here. And the teams as we went through this what we tried to think about is ways we could add incremental value to American Express, ways we could add incremental value to our merchants, ways we could add incremental value to PayPal and ways we could add incremental value to our card members. And so when you think about sort of this integration within the app or within the wallet, the one thing that you realize is, the more seamless you can make things, the easier it is for your card members, your customers to transact. I mean when you think about merchants, for example, one of the things that they look for is to make sure that they don't use shopping carts and that they make sure it is easy as possible online and not shopping carts in the supermarket but online and what we wanted to make sure is that we can make it as seamless as possible for our card members to be loaded in their card into PayPal because PayPal offers us a tremendous expansion of our network today. And so, to be able to make those millions of merchants of available to our court members in a more seamless way is a win-win for everybody. It's a win-win for merchants, it's a win-win for us, it's a win-win for PayPal, it\u2019s a win-win for card members. As far as you know the American Express pay with points and how many card members will use those points at PayPal merchants, this is the most valuable bank of points anywhere in the world bar none. It\u2019 a behemoth and the reality is that we are looking for more ubiquity. Our card members use points for a variety of things at a variety of places and this just expands that ubiquity. And it is going to be good for merchants, it's going to be good for our card members. Can I put a number around it? I can't put a number around it, but the reality is I think this will be an uptick in points burn. I think this will be an uptick in card member satisfaction. I think it's going to be an uptick in merchant satisfaction as well so we're really pleased with this and obviously there will be more announcements as we move along from a timing perspective and what have you. But we're really excited about this expansion of strategic partnership.\nOperator: Thank you. And now the last question comes from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Good afternoon. Thanks for tucking me in. Wanted to ask one strategic question on a piece of the revenue that you haven't touched upon much today is the annual fees because with the platinum and gold cards you\u2019ve seen some increases and Jeff mentioned some increase or some growth in Japan and Australia on the fees. Just wondering if you're strategically thinking about fee increases being more likely in the future. It seemed like that was something -- there was some hesitancy around in past years, but it seems like there's more appetite among consumers for higher fees. And I'm also wondering if there's also more trade off on some of your member services with that too.\nSteve Squeri: So if you look at it right, our card members are looking for value and our experiences is that card members will pay for value and so what you\u2019ve seen is, lots of value injection and that value injection takes many forms. I mean, when we look at card member engagement cost, you look at some fixed cost which could be your allowances and things like that which get consumed as people go through, but they don't get charged on the variable basis. You look at rewards cost and you look at deals we may do with some of our merchant partners where both of us can bring value to that equation as well. And so our belief is, if you are bringing value, you should charge for that value and there's no better proof in the pudding than when in a very, very difficult competitive environment with the launch Chase Sapphire, we put in a $100 increase in our in our platinum card and so attrition goes down and so our acquisition go up and so more acquisition go up from a millennial perspective as well and reality is, that\u2019s all due to value. People will pay for value and American Express is known as a brand that does provide value and so where we have opportunities to raise our fees, we will raise our fees and we did that just with the gold card, we've done that in various international markets, but we\u2019ve injected value and when you inject value, the other benefit of injecting value is people who use the card more. When they use the card more, they spend more. When they spend more, you give them an opportunity to revolve more. So it's a virtuous cycle as far as we're concerned and we're going to continue to pursue that strategy as well.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Chris, for that call. With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve, thank you, Jeff, thank you to those of you on the phone. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions after the call.

We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's presentation slides and in the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.

We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion. Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of Q2 financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session on the quarter's results, with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks Edmund and good afternoon everyone. As I have been meeting with shareholders and analysts over the past several months, a number of you have said, you would like to hear my views of the company more frequently. With that in mind, I plan to join our earnings call with Jeff, going forward, to share my perspective on our strategic progress and quarterly results. Jeff will continue to cover our financial performance in more detail, before we take your questions. As you saw in our release earlier today, we had a strong second quarter that built on the momentum we started the year with. Revenues grew 9% and earnings per share were $1.84. We are a globally integrated payments company and the power of our differentiated business model was evident throughout the results. Our revenue growth was driven by broad-based increases in card member spending and fees, and it also reflected higher loan volumes, which that spending growth helped to generate. Second, we are both strengthening relationships with current customers and attracting new ones, through innovative products and services. Third, our disciplined control of operating expenses, combined with revenue growth, gave us the flexibility to make substantial investments in our global brand campaign. Additional customer benefits and digital capabilities that will help us grow our business over the long term. In addition to our business results, we completed this year's CCAR process with a green light to increase the quarterly dividend, and we are resuming our share buybacks this quarter. All in all, I feel very good about our results to-date. Looking ahead, we expect 2018 revenues to be up at least 9% and we are reaffirming our full year EPS guidance at the high end of the range we set for this year, which is the $6.90 to $7.30 per share. Coming into the CEO role earlier this year, I focused the organization on four strategic imperatives. You may recall, that I first shared them with you back in October of last year. At the midyear mark, I am pleased to report solid progress on each. The first imperative is to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space worldwide. We once again delivered record performance on our U.S. Platinum card, and we continue to refresh our premium product line globally, with enhancements to our Platinum card in Mexico and Hong Kong, and our Gold card in the U.K. In addition, we announced new co-branded cards with Marriott and launched the new Cash Magnet card in the U.S. This follows the launch earlier this year of a new suite of co-branded products with Hilton. We are continuing to invest in differentiated value propositions that distinguish American Express from the competition. We provide our card members with global access to exclusive services and experiences. We continue to expand the global range of these offerings and have recently announced the expansion of our Centurion Lounges with new openings scheduled in Los Angeles and Denver, and a second one in New York, at JFK. Our official partnership with the Wimbledon Championship and a new partnership with Saks to offer value to our joint customers. Our second strategic imperative is to build on our strong position in commercial payments. Just last month, we announced a multiyear partnership with Amazon, which will include a new co-branded small business credit card in the U.S. This is an exciting opportunity and a great example of why we are the small business partner of choice, because of our ability to bring value to partners and their customers by leveraging our brand, innovative technology, data analytics and other unique assets. In addition, we also introduced new value propositions for Hilton and Marriott small business card members in the U.S. Our third strategic imperative, is to strengthen our global integrated network to provide unique value. We introduced a new card with Wells Fargo, one of our larger GNS partners in the U.S. This is an important win and another validation of our differentiated benefits and services, like access to one of a kind experiences and special offers that enables us to win in a competitive marketplace. We continued our progress towards parity coverage in the U.S. and expanded our merchant network internationally. Our fourth strategic imperative is to make Amex an essential part of our customer's digital lives. Technology and innovation on the engines that continue to fuel our brand, and customer value propositions, and we are making investments to enhance our capabilities in this space. We are developing artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain capabilities to better serve our customers. Our mobile enhancements are being recognized, and we placed first in JD Power's 2018 Mobile App Competitive Survey, up from sixth in 2017. We expanded chat-based servicing feature on our mobile app, as another way to serve our customers where, how and when they want, and we are continuing to expand our capabilities, as we integrate two specialized platforms we recently acquired, Mezi and Cake, into our digital offerings. We are also experimenting with technology and recently announced a pilot with the online retailer Boxed, using blockchain and our membership rewards program to give card members more ways to earn points, and merchants, more ways to drive business. Two additional and important second quarter items are worth noting. First, we launched our new global brand campaign, which underscores the powerful backing of American Express. The campaign is being across both our consumer and business segments, and it drives home what our brand is all about, building enduring customer relationships through their intertwined business and personal lives. Finally, my list of wins for the for the quarter , includes the favorable ruling we received in a major antitrust case at the Supreme Court. The Court has found that our differentiated business model has spurred innovation in the payments industry. Their ruling was a welcome end to a long legal battle with the Department of Justice. All in all, it was a very good quarter. Six months into my tenure as CEO, I feel good about what we have accomplished. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. Let me now turn the call over to Jeff, who is going to provide more detail about our financial results.\nJeff Campbell: Well thanks Steve, and good afternoon everyone. It's good to be here today, to talk about another quarter with strong performance. To get right into our summary of financials on slide 3, second quarter revenues of $10 billion grew 9%, another quarter of revenue growth at the highest levels we have seen since the financial crisis. Even more importantly, this result was driven by strong growth across all of discount revenues, fee revenues, and net interest income. Given the recent strength in the dollar, our reported revenue growth was pretty consistent with our FX adjusted revenue growth, unlike the last few quarters, where the weaker dollar caused our reported revenue growth to be above our FX adjusted revenue growth. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 21% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $1.84 for the quarter, up 25% from the prior year. Now of course, our earnings growth this year reflects the passage of the Tax Act last December, but it also reflects our business model's steady and consistent earnings growth, along with the impact of our share repurchases, lowering the shares outstanding by 3%, despite the suspension of our share repurchase program for the first half of 2018. All in, these are results we feel really good about. Looking at the details of our performance, I will start with Billed Business, which you see several views of on slides 4 through 6. I'd start by pointing you to the top right of slide 4, where you see that there are two different trends impacting our overall billings growth. This quarter, our proprietary billings make up 85% of our overall billings, and growth in these proprietary billings accelerated to 12%, up from 11% in the first quarter, all on an FX adjusted basis. This is another sign of the momentum we have in our business. You can also see on the top part of slide 4, that the other 15% of our overall billings, which come from our network business, GNS, is now seeing the expected impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia, and hence billings in GNS were down 3%, and this caused our total AXP billings to come in at 9% for Q2. As you turn to slide 5, I'd remind you that our results this quarter reflect the organizational changes Steve has made, since becoming CEO, so we now have three reportable operating segments; Global Consumer, Global Commercial, and Global Merchants and Network Services. Although we are reporting financial results on a Global Consumer basis, we do want to continue to provide you transparency into both the U.S. and international consumer metrics. So here on slide 5, you can see all of the diverse parts of our business, maintaining or accelerating good growth rates, aside from GNS. Turning to slide 6, we have a more detailed view of billings by customer segment. This slide also serves as a helpful reminder of the relative size of each customer segment. Global Commercial and Global Consumer are roughly the same size, representing 41% and 44% of Q2 billings respectively. Global Network services makes up the remaining 15% of billings. Starting on the left, with our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, U.S. SME was up 10%, and has been relatively stable for several quarters. International SME, which has consistently been one of our strongest growing customer segments, accelerated to 25% on an FX adjusted basis in the second quarter, reflecting our increasing investments in this particularly attractive component of our global opportunities. The large and [ph] Global Customer segment continued to perform nicely with 9% growth on an FX adjusted basis, and on a related note, you can see in the earnings tables that the company's overall global airline billings continued to accelerate to 7% on an FX adjusted basis, and U.S. T&E billings growth remains strong at 8%. Moving to U.S. Consumer, which made up about 32% of the company's billings in the second quarter, we are pleased to report our second consecutive quarter of double digit growth. We feel particularly good about our U.S. consumer platinum performance, where growth did not slow as we expected this quarter, as we fully lapped the changes that we made to the product early in 2017. Around half of our acquisitions on U.S. Consumer Platinum continued to come from millennials. I would also point out, that similar to last quarter, our strong billings growth reflects both our continued focus on customer engagement, as well as general strength we are seeing in consumer spending and confidence, within our premium U.S. consumer space. Moving to the right, we continue to see strong growth for international consumer, which is up 18% on an FX adjusted basis, up from 16% in Q1. Although it is only 12% of overall billings, we feel really good about the widespread strong growth in key markets, with FX adjusted growth of 13% in Japan, and over 20% in both Australia and the U.K. Last, on the right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 3%, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia. Although, network billings are down in these regions, we are seeing strong growth on the proprietary side, as I just mentioned. Additionally, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia markets, the remaining portion of GNS was up 8%. Overall, we feel good about the diverse sources of growth. We have been sustaining double digit billings growth in U.S. consumer and U.S. SME, while also accelerating billings growth across both international consumer and SME, as well as with large and global corporate clients. Turning next to loan performance on slide 7, our total loan growth was 16% in the second quarter and in line with the prior quarter, and once again, over 60% of our growth came from existing customers. I'd remind you, that we completed the Hilton portfolio acquisition earlier this year, which contributed about 140 basis points and 130 basis points to the growth rates in the first and second quarters respectively. On the right, net interest yield was 10.6%, up 30 basis points versus the prior year. For some time now, we have been saying that we expect year-over-year growth in net interest yield to moderate, and you can clearly see that playing out, while net yield is still growing over the prior year, the increase has moderated over the last few quarters, as we lap some of our pricing initiatives, and experience higher funding costs. Lastly, I would add that we typically see a seasonal decline in net yield from the first to second quarter, as you did see this year, with net yield down 20 basis points sequentially in the second quarter. To spend a minute now on funding, I'd remind you that our funding strategy is to be active in three markets, deposits, asset-backed securities, and unsecured debt. Focusing on deposits, we have about $67 billion in total at June 30, with about $31 billion coming from sweep accounts and CDs, which tend to move in line with market rates. The remaining $36 billion in deposits is coming from our online personal savings program, which in a rising rate environment, is generally our least expensive source of funding. We expect to continue to grow our online savings program steadily over the next few years, facilitated by the recent consolidation of our two U.S. banks. In terms of rate sensitivity, since the Fed started raising rates back in mid-2016, our beta has been about 0.45, but is trending up. More recently, our beta is closer to 0.7, which is also what we use for internal planning purposes. Stepping back, while we view a rising rate environment as a modest headwind, it is usually mitigated in part by a stronger economic environment, which is certainly what we see currently. Turning next to credit metrics, which you see on slide 8; starting on the left with the lending portfolio, the lost rate for the quarter was 2.1%, up about 30 basis points from last year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter. As a reminder of what we have been saying quite some time, we expect these rates to drift up as they have, to back lending rate [indiscernible] in the second quarter were slightly better than we originally expected in our plan for the year. On the right side, you can see net write-off rates in our charge portfolio, as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. There is often some quarterly volatility in these rates due to seasonality, and this quarter's write-off rate included some write-offs related to the hurricanes last fall, for which we had previously taken a reserve. Looking forward, we don't see anything in the performance of our tenured customers to suggest any change in the broader environment. Given these credit metrics and moving to slide 8, provision was $806 million, up 38% in the second quarter, right in line with our full year expectation of mid-30% growth, despite loan growth running a bit higher than we had originally planned. Turning now to revenues on slide 10; as I suggested, revenue growth was 9% in the second quarter. This represents our fifth straight quarter of having adjusted revenue of at least 8%, driven by steady growth from all of spending, fees and lending. On slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. Discount revenue, which makes up over 60% of our revenue, was up 8%, which I will come back to on the next slide. Net card fees growth was 9%, driven by growth in key international markets, as well as Platinum and Delta in the U.S. We continue to feel good about our ability to generate card fee revenues by offering differentiated value propositions right in the face of constant competition. Another example, year-to-date through May, over 60% of our global consumer new card acquisitions were on fee paying cards. Other fees and commissions were up 5%, while other revenue was down 8%, driven by several discrete items. Lastly, let's turn to net interest income, which I would point out is down to being just 18% of our second quarter revenue. For this quarter, net interest income was up 19%, driven by the growth in loans and yield that I mentioned a few moments ago. Turning now to slide 12, to cover discount revenue, our biggest component of revenue. Starting on the left, discount rate in Q2 was 2.37%, stable for the last few quarters, and down 5 basis points from a year ago. As you have heard both Steve and I talk about, our focus is on driving discount revenue growth, not on managing the average discount rate. This has led us to strategies like increasing coverage with small merchants, and deepening relationships with our key strategic partners, which we believe are key components helping drive the strong discount revenue growth you see on the right side of the page. Discount revenue growth was 8% on an FX adjusted basis in the second quarter, maintaining the strong momentum of the prior quarter. Turning now to expenses on slide 13; before coming to the components of customer engagement, marketing and business development, card member rewards and card member services on the next slide, let me cover operating expenses. Operating expenses were down 2% this quarter and though this reflected a number of discrete items, even excluding these items, we continue to have well controlled operating expenses. Our ability to generate steady OpEx leverage continues to be a key part of our financial model, and one that we have great confidence in sustaining over the long term. So that brings me next to customer engagement on slide 14. In total, customer engagement expenses were $4.5 billion in the second quarter, up 13% from the prior year. Starting at the bottom, we have the marketing and business development line, which has two components, our traditional marketing and promotion expenses, as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. This lending total is up 14% versus the prior year, and there are three things that I would highlight. As I said last quarter, we have some increases in partner payments this year, due to recent co-brand negotiations, and agreements and growth in our corporate business. Second, Steve talked about the launch of our new global brand campaign in the second quarter, and as you would expect, we have increased marketing spend to support the brand refresh. And third, the benefits of the Tax Act and our strong performance year-to-date have allowed us to ramp up somewhat the spending we do to drive long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. As I said on last quarter's earnings call, we began the spending in the second quarter and expect it to continue through the balance of the year. I would point out, that the confluence of all these factors, allowed us to acquire 2.9 million new proprietary cards globally this quarter, which is one of our highest acquisition quarters recently, when you set aside the Hilton portfolio of purchase. Moving up to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 11% from the prior year, the rewards were expected to and did, grow roughly in line with proprietary billings program. Moving then to the top of the slide, as you have seen for some time and as we continue to expect, card member services costs were our fastest growing expense line, up 22% in the second quarter. The kinds of things that drive card member services cost are exactly the things that drive the differentiated value propositions that Steve discussed, that are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access, and other travel benefits. Turning last to capital on slide 15; as you know, we suspended share repurchases for the first half of 2018 to rebuild our capital ratios, following the $2.6 billion charge we took in Q4 2017 related to the Tax Act. And given our high ROE, we can quickly rebuild capital. So at the end of the second quarter, our common equity tier-1 ratio had increased to 10.1%. We are now at the low end of the 10% to 11% range that we are targeting. Given this, we will be resuming share buybacks in the third quarter, as the Fed did not object to our CCAR submission that raises our dividend by $0.04 per quarter, beginning the third quarter and returns $3.4 billion of capital through share repurchases over the next four quarters. Overall, this capital plan is consistent with our objective to target common equity tier-1 ratios of 10% to 11%, while supporting asset growth and distributing capital to shareholders. So that brings us to our outlook, and then we will open the call to questions. As Steve mentioned, our expectation continues to be at the high end of our original EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. We are really pleased with our revenue performance to-date, and given the strong trends that we are seeing in the performance of our recent investments, we now expect revenue growth of at least 9% for the full year. Our solid performance in the first half of the year, has allowed us to raise our guidance to the high end of our original range, while also increasing our investments into areas that we believe will drive long term sustainable revenue and earnings growth. This guidance is reflective of our simple financial model, in which we invest in our many and diverse growth businesses, generate operating leverage and return capital to shareholders to drive steady and consistent revenue and EPS growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Edmund to begin the Q&A.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Steve, just a question on the page 2 of your strategic imperatives. Do you have specific measurements against each of those four that you are comparing yourselves to, and can you give any color on what you are looking at?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. So I think, so as we look at the four strategic imperatives, we have looked at these over the longer term, and so while we are not looking at specific year-to-year growth targets, we really are looking at, what, from a capabilities, and what from an accomplishment perspective. So let me just give you an example. When we look at the premium segment, what we are really looking to do, is to expand our definition of premium, as you have thought about premium over the years, we have thought about premium from the perspective of premium wallets. We are really looking at those that really look for premium service, premium access. And so that then includes to expand to more millennials, and so, when we look at some of our platinum card acquisition, and over half of our acquisition is coming millennials. So from that regard, it really is an expansion of the value proposition. When we look at sort of the second one as it relates to our competitive -- continue to build on our competitive position from a commercial perspective, things like our growth from an SME perspective and international, our continued growth and progress that we made from a co-brand perspective in the U.S. with Hilton, with Marriott, and the launch of the Amazon card. So looking much more than just the metrics we have, but how we are embedding ourselves even more, and the launch of working capital and so forth. When we get into the network piece of it, we are really looking to expand with more partnerships, and Wells Fargo is a great example of that expansion, and in addition, obviously, coverage, we continue to push on coverage, and we have stated from a coverage perspective, we want to be a parity coverage in the U.S. by the end of 2019. From a digital perspective, when we talk about being more essential in people's digital lives, I think here, there is a lot of qualitative stuff that's going on. I mean, to be able to go from a J.D. Power survey from number six last year, from a mobile app perspective to number one, and why do we do that? Well, we really focused on engaging our customers in that app, number one. Putting chat based services within that, looking at other things from a digital perspective, whether it's the blockchain test that we are doing, our acquisition of Mezi and our acquisition of Cake. So as we think about those four things, we are really looking, from an initiative perspective and how we are moving those things forward. And I think, the initiatives that I laid out and the specific actions that we have done is, is moving those business priorities forward for us.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Brendler with Buckingham. Please go ahead.\nChris Brendler: Hi. Thanks [indiscernible] and thanks for taking the question. I guess, to circle back on the U.S. car business for a second, you said you had a Platinum refresh last quarter. How much of that Platinum refresh was lapping in the second quarter, and sort of more broadly, as you lookout the rest of the year, the marketing investments you have made this quarter, is the plan for the second half to really continue to put the pedal to the metal on marketing, and what does that mean for U.S. bill business growth? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well I think, Chris, to be clear, as you recall, in the U.S., we refreshed both the consumer, as well as the small business Platinum products in the early part of 2017, and we have been thrilled with the reaction to both of those upgrades. One of the things I cautioned people about last quarter, on the April call, was that well, the second quarter was going to be the first quarter where we fully lapped all those changes, and that might cause a little bit of a moderation in growth in those two products. Not as much surprised this quarter, which we really didn't, and so we were particularly pleased to see on the consumer side, that the growth rates did not slow at all, even though we have completely lapped now all of those changes we made, and I think it really goes back, Steve, into the strategic imperative. It's all about differentiated value propositions that we can put in the marketplace, and we feel really good about that Platinum. The other comment I made is, we are in an unusual situation as a company, and that we have tremendous opportunities to invest and accelerate our growth across both consumer, commercial, U.S. and international, and we are always leaving a few really good opportunities on the table, as we balance short and long term financial performance. So when we have really good performance, as we have had year-to-date, it allows us to dip a little deeper into those really good opportunities, and I think that bodes really well for long term sustainability of the kind of revenue growth we are seeing now.\nSteve Squeri: And to Jeff's point about continuing to invest in unique and differentiated services, we had announced the -- we are going to implement three new lounges, which adds again to more value for our travelling Platinum card members. We have also added to the Platinum card merchant funded value offers from Sacks, and so that adds more value, and it shows the power of the integrated model. We are able to take our merchant relationships that we have and marry those up with our high spending card members, and it works for our card members, and it obviously works for our merchants as well. But just -- the other point that I did make, and that may have caused a little bit of a confusion is, in addition to -- obviously, we refresh the Platinum card products in the United States, we did in the second quarter, refresh the Platinum card products that we have in Hong Kong and in Mexico, and those cards are of smaller footprint, obviously, than our U.S. -- both U.S. platinum cards. But I think it is important to show that, as we think about the premium segment, you tend to focus on the premium segment as the U.S. There is a large premium segment outside the United States, and it is really important for us to continue to refresh the product line on a global basis.\nChris Brendler: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Steve, good to have you on and hi Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, as you mentioned, your top line expectations are now better than expected, and your EPS guidance didn't really change. Should we assume all of the incremental revenues are being spent, and that the marketing and business development line, that was up quite considerably, and you mentioned several reasons why. Should we expect that to continue to grow at the rate it is going forward, and maybe you could just talk about the payback on those returns? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Let me make a couple of comments, and then I will ask Jeff to jump in. Again, I think we try to be as transparent as we can from an EPS perspective. We have adjusted at the end of the first quarter, as we looked out, we said, obviously $6.90 to $7.30, we said we'd be to the high end. But we feel really good about 25% EPS growth this quarter and 38% growth in the first quarter. Adjusted revenue growth of at least 8% for five consecutive quarters. And I think what's important to think about when you think about customer engagement, is that, you know, we are making investments not only to drive results this year, but we are looking to drive results in the moderate to long term. And so, our objective is, is really to make sure that our revenue growth levels are sustainable, and our objective is also to make sure we are taking advantage of those opportunities, as they present ourselves. And Jeff has just made his point. I mean, we don't want to have opportunities go by the board. So that's how we think about it.\nJeff Campbell: I don't really have a lot to add. I think Sanjay, the second quarter marketing and promotion was a particular spike, because we only launch a new brand campaign every couple of years. But to Steve's point, that is also the line -- where a lot of the things we do that, we think are about driving longer term growth though. So we feel good about the fact that we are hitting the high end of the guidance range we started out with, and we feel really good about the revenue growth sustainability we are building.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good evening. It looks like the contribution of your discount revenue as a percentage of revenues, net of rewards expense increased to 50% this quarter from 48% last quarter, while your net interest income contribution actually decreased. That seems to mark a reversal in the trend that we have been seeing. So you know, my question is, as we look ahead, is it reasonable to expect that we will continue to see a growing mix of your revenues coming from spend versus lend? And if I may just tack on to that, there has been some focus on the other operating expenses being better and part of that being from like reserve releases and perhaps, could you comment on, whether, consistent with your philosophy of reinvesting gains in the business, that perhaps part of the reason for the increase in marketing and promotion was the opportunistic reinvestment of some of those releases? Appreciate that.\nJeff Campbell: Well let me see if I get all, if I miss one, you can come back. First, I guess I'd make a couple of points on the net interest income discount rate mix. And that, on the discount revenue side, look, you do have a couple of things like OptBlue, like the immediacy of the regulation in Australia, and Europe, like some of the big strategic partner renegotiations we had last year, that are causing a little bit more reduction in the discount rate this year, than we would probably expect on a run-rate basis. So by definition, that tells you over time, discount revenues should move up a little bit in the mix. On the opposite side, we have had a really good run on net interest income, of doing a lot of really good stuff on the pricing side. But, I have been pointing out for a few quarters, that is an end to that, and so, I do expect the growth in net interest income to moderate down more to where loan growth is. So I do think those two things in the absence of other changes in the business will cause a continuation of the trend that you called out. In terms of reserve releases, I guess I am, Bill, a little puzzled by that. There is nothing in particular that's unusual going on in our operating expense line. We are just, as we always will be and as we have been for many years, very focused on the aspect of our business model, that is we can grow and pump a lot of revenue through our fixed cost infrastructure without adding a lot of cost, and technology helps us do that more efficiently every year, and that's really what you see happening on the operating expense side. When you hear Steve and I talk about investing a little bit opportunistically this year, it really comes from the revenue upside.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah, just one other point that I will make, is as you look at sort of the shift I guess, the little bit of the shift mix, and it's a slight shift mix this particular quarter, we are really focused on driving spend, right? So and if you dig within the numbers, and if you go to the slide that showed sort of the breakout of billings, you see across every single one, whether it's SME, SME international, U.S. consumer, and consumer international, these are all double digit growth numbers, and when you look -- if you net out GNS, we had 12% proprietary billings growth in the second quarter. And you know, we had that GNS drag due to regulatory issues in Europe and in Australia. Well that spending is obviously driving the discount rate revenue, but that's the spending as well, where the lending comes in. We drive spend, and from that spend, we get -- we look to get whatever lend we can get from our existing customers. And again, and Jeff mentioned this in his remarks as well, 60% of our AR growth this particular quarter came from existing card members. So we feel good about how the model is working, right? I mean, the whole thing works together. We are -- the discount rate is working for us as well. It's driving more spend. That spend drives more lend with existing customers, hence, drives, what we believe, is very good revenue growth at 9%.\nBill Carcache: Thank you very much.\nSteve Squeri: Thank Bill.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSteve Squeri: Hey Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Good evening guys. How are you doing? Jeff, I wanted to ask a question on capital; you talked about the 10% to 11% CET1 as the binding constraint as you shift from CCAR to the rating agencies. I guess, given the lower risk and less NII dependency of your model, like why is that the right number, given that your model is less lend centric and a lot of the other traditional card lenders will be running at 10% to 11%? And I guess, what do you think is the right level of capital to actually run the business, relative to what the rating agencies are telling you? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: You know Ryan, maybe I should bring you with us on our next round of meetings with the rating agencies. You are correctly pointing out that, as I think about what the Fed has said publicly about where they are likely be taking this CCAR process, I think the Fed sees this [ph] to be the constraint on our capital, and I do think it's about the rating agencies. We are very comfortable with the way we are rated today, but we think the ratings we have are important to sustain, and the reality of the way we work with the rating agencies today, is that's going to require us to stay at that tier-1 common equity ratio in the 10% to 11% range. And certainly, we have lots and lots of discussions with them about this unique strength of our business model, about how strongly we performed in economic downturns and that's probably [ph] something you see in the Fed's modeling of the latest round of CCAR results. But I am trying to be very transparent. 10% to 11% isn't where we are today, unless we succeed in further -- working with the rating agencies. So I will give you a call to tell you when the next meeting is, and you can join us.\nRyan Nash: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much. Just pulling up on the top line discussion. It seemed that, except for the impact from regulation on discount revenue; discount revenue would have continued to accelerate year-over-year. And so, what did your sense about some of the underlying drivers, such as the benefits of corporate tax reform on commercial C&E growth and that kind of thing to the extent that these can continue to maintain accelerating discount revenue, as the comps begin to get a little bit tougher, relative to the back half of last year?\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me start Steve, maybe then you can continue. So it's a good question Eric. When you think about sustainability, I'd make a few comments. We can look at the acceleration in revenue growth we have seen over the last few years, and very-very much link it to changes we have made in the business, and that really builds confidence as to the sustainability. Couple of things around the edges though, that I would say, go a little bit beyond that, that's clearly in this calendar year, we are benefitting a little bit from buying the Hilton portfolio. So that goes away next year, and the other thing is, last quarter, I brought up the fact that we had seen a modest acceleration in organic growth that began very late last year. It has now sustained itself for the first half 2018, and that clearly is indicative of the fact that at least for the demographic of customers we serve, there is clearly some increased level of confidence. So that could strengthen, it could weaken, we will have to see where the economy goes. But other than those two pieces, I think, we feel pretty good about the things we have done that are driving the revenue growth and their sustainability.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. And I think two of those things that we are doing, that are really driving the revenue growth, it's really the coverage initiatives. I mean, when there is more and more places that use the card. I mean, last year, we signed over 1 million merchants in the United States, and what happens is, that gives us an opportunity to go after a higher share of wallet with our existing card members, and it's also, a very good way to attract new card members. And we are doing a really good job from an acquisition perspective, both in the United States and in our international markets, of gaining new card members, both from a commercial perspective, and from a consumer perspective. I mean, just to put a highlight on, so that the volume growth, when you look at the second quarter, 25% SME international growth and 18% consumer growth in international, and that shows us that the investments that we have made and we are going to continue to go do well on those same investments, because they are truly working for us. And look, the SME business in the U.S. and the consumer business in the U.S. are obviously more mature than the businesses that we have, and a little bit more competitive than -- from an international perspective. But again, double digit growth in both of those portfolios as well. So again, really a lot of focus on our card member acquisition efforts. Coverage is really helping, and then, we also do, is the journeys we take our card members through, to get more and more of their spend from a trigger marketing perspective, we continue to do that, and will continue to do that, as we look to get more and more pockets of their spend.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks. And if I can just follow-up on one question? You indicated that there is some increase in investment coming from the top line strength. I think previously Jeff, you had indicated that might be something around $200 million in the second, third and fourth quarters. Is that still the same investment level?\nJeff Campbell: Well, to be clear, so the $200 million, Eric, is what -- when the Tax Act passed in December. We actually made a very conscious choice. Even we had the plan done for the year, to add another $200 million, because we didn't made that choice till the beginning of January, we couldn't thoughtfully spend it in the first quarter. What we are telling you on this call is above and beyond that $200 million, our revenue strength is allowing us to both get to the high end of our guidance range, but also put some additional money to work, making sure we are doing all the kinds of things, Steve, you just talked about, that are going to really sustain the sort of revenue growth we are getting.\nEric Wasserstrom: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a question from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yeah thanks. Was hoping to better understand kind of strategically, why you decided to add this new Shop Saks benefit to the Platinum card, at a time, I think where you'd indicated you are already very pleased with kind of the reengagement and the customer acquisitions you are getting from that card. What was the need to do that? And also, could you give us a sense of the cost? To you, I mean, presumably, you are not paying your merchant partner a hundred cents on the dollar for the benefit. I assume, the same goes for the benefit you provide through Uber. If you could just give us a sense of what the costs might be, relative to how the --\nJeff Campbell: I am going to give you a sense of what the cost is for Saks, zero. It's fully funded by the merchant partner. So as we -- look, we are in a big -- one of the unique advantages of our model is, we manage a lot of our merchants, and as we manage them, what the objective is, is to help them drive and grow their business, and in conversation with Saks, they are very interested in our Platinum card holders. Our Platinum cardholders tend to spend money at Saks, and/or merchants like Saks. And so, in working with Saks, we came up with $100 annual credit on Saks purchases. And so, the real question is, why wouldn't you? Someone is handing you $100 and it fits from a premium perspective, it fits from a demographic perspective, it's going to help drive value to Saks and it helps drive value to our customers as well. So that's why we added the benefit. And I think, we will continue to add merchant funded benefits when they make sense. And what happens also with the Platinum card, this is an offer that sticks with the whole year. What we will do from time-to-time, is do time based offers for our Platinum card holders and for our Centurion card holders, because merchants want access to those customers, so that's why we did it.\nMark DeVries: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nSteve Squeri: Hey Don.\nJeff Campbell: Hey Don.\nDon Fandetti: Steve, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the commercial segment? The bill business is obviously performing well. You got the Amazon co-brand. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive intensity in commercial, maybe contrast it with consumer, and do you think there is more upside to the growth rates that you are seeing today?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. So it's different, right? I mean, so let's talk about international. In international, from an SME perspective, it's really an open playing field. I mean, when you look at the penetration, I think the market is a couple of percent penetrated. So we have, not only replicated what we have been doing in the United States from a sales force perspective, but a talent perspective, and really engaging from a digital perspective, and that's why you are seeing these growth rates. And so, I am sure, over time, it will become competitive as well, as it's -- we believe it's a huge opportunity, which is why we continue to invest and why we continue to see large growth rates. When you look at the SME segment in United States, it's competitive regionally, and different banks through different banks, because customers mean different things to them. And so we compete regionally. So you will compete with Capital Ones and we will compete with Wells and we will compete with Citi and JPMorgan and so forth. But I would say is that, it is probably not as intense as the competition that we traditionally see in the U.S. consumer business. The other thing is, is that we are truly leveraging scale here. We are leveraging the assets that we have from a large and middle market, and global corporate card perspective, we are leveraging that global footprint, and that's really helping us out. And so, we will continue to do that. I think, if you look at Amazon, you look at Marriott, I will just pick those two out in particular, because they truly had a choice. With the split portfolio with Marriott; Marriott could have gone either with us or with Chase or could have split it and what they like was our assets, our ability to reach small businesses, and so we won that part of the portfolio, and Amazon obviously looked at it the same way. So we are excited about not only the growth opportunities here, but the new partnerships that we really just engaged with. So we are going to continue to aggressively compete in these segments. And the large segment, 9% growth. And so, that's what I have always talked about, when we have had the one-on-one analyst meetings, I have talked about how our value is to really help companies control their spending and reduce their spending. But as Jeff said, we are seeing an uptick in T&E, we are seeing an uptick in sort of airline spending, and we are winning more accounts. So we believe, our -- we play really well in this space, and we are going to continue to compete very vigorously, as we move forward.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. So maybe, could you talk a little about how we should think about the provision and reserve build over the course of the next year? Just given, you have still got 30% plus growth in losses on both the charge and the credit portfolios, and this quarter is a fairly small build. But if the double digit loan growth continues, like how should we think about that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so if you think about it, Moshe, we went into this year with a very clear expectation. We communicated publicly that we thought provision would grow 30%, given the growth we have seen and the -- very importantly, as you would understand, the accelerating growth that you have seen over the last few years, as we go through a seasoning process on some of the vintages from the last couple of years, and that's playing out actually a little better than we thought. So our loan growth is a little higher than we expected. Provision is coming in right where we thought this year, and so we feel very comfortable and good about the trends, and we feel good about the overall economics. I'd also make the point that, I think you can kind of see this, if you look at the provision slide. When you think about 38% for the year, in 2017, the first two quarters were much lower than you had kind of a step up, as we started building reserves. So that factors into a little bit of the trend I would expect for the next two quarters. Now once you get beyond 2018, look, we will have to see at what rate loan growth continues to perform. I mean, I don't want to govern our team, I want to pursue as much really good, really economic, through the cycle loan growth, as we can achieve, particularly with the focus we have on our existing customers. So depending on if that happens to be in 2019, we will have to see exactly what it means for provision. And what we feel comfortable with is, we are getting really good, through the cycle economics, even net of the provisions that -- when you are accelerating growth, you have to billed.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks very much.\nJeff Campbell: Thanks Moshe.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I wanted to ask one question on Australia of all places. Just because I am trying to understand the dynamic there. I thought you said that billed business was up 20% year-on-year in Australia. But then you got the headwinds from GNS. Is there something in the dynamic or we are going to lap a pricing?\nJeff Campbell: Chris, I should probably clarify that. So to remind everyone, what's going on in Australia, is with the latest round of regulatory changes, we are in the process of shutting down our network business. So we had some great bank partnerships that are slowly going away, and so that's why, when you look at the GNS business, it is shrinking in Australia, and will eventually shrink to essentially zero. But that very fact is creating some really interesting growth opportunities for us on what -- the term we use as, our proprietary side, where we are the card issuer, including a co-brand, that we have launched with one of our former network bank partners, WestPac. So that is fuelling really-really high growth rates for us in Australia, over 20% is the number I cited. And I'd just remind everyone, that when you replace a dollar of network billings with a dollar of proprietary billings, that is a really-really good trade economically. So in some ways, this is just a commentary on the flexibility of our business model, as the world changes competitively or from a regulatory perspective. But I'd say, we feel good about the overall trends in Australia.\nChris Donat: Okay. And that you got a decent runway to grow the business, as you move more proprietary in Australia; because there had been, I think in the past, you disclosed that Australia was, I want to say like 4% to 5% of revenues, or when you did sort of FX exposure, it was in one of your larger markets at least?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. You know, Australia is one of the five or six markets that are very significant to us outside. When you look at our non-U.S. results, you can pick eight or 10 markets and that's most of the economics in Australia would be near the top of that list.\nChris Donat: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will be from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Campbell: Hey Craig.\nCraig Maurer: Hi. How are you?\nJeff Campbell: Good.\nCraig Maurer: Wanted to drill down if I can, a little bit on what you are seeing in the U.S., from our vantage point, we have seen deceleration in all your competitors in U.S. and their U.S. purchase volume. You guys have done an amazing job sustaining growth. So I guess, the question begs, who are you taking share from and in what categories in the U.S.?\nSteve Squeri: From an SME perspective, we continue to grow and even large market customers are even growing, because if you look at sort of large market global results in the U.S., just look at it sort of a year ago, these were sort of stagnant numbers for us. And our consumer business, we feel really good. I mean, we feel really good about the U.S. consumer business. Double digit growth two quarters in a row, and we feel good about the co-brand partnerships that we just announced and launched obviously, two of them. So look, with the network to report, I guess, next week, we will find out sort of where we are from a share perspective, at least, directionally. And look, you have seen Citi and JPM and U.S. Bank and so forth reports. So you can sort of look at their results and our results and you can make your own assertion of just where it may be coming from.\nCraig Maurer: All right. Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Okay. So anyway, thank you everybody for participating today, and let me just give a couple of closing thoughts. Hopefully, what you have seen as a globally integrated payments company here, our business model and we hope that the commentary did this today, does set us apart from the card issuing and merchant acquiring competitors. I think Saks is a really great example of just what we can do, with relationships on both parts. It's different in the networks and it's certainly different in the pure Fintechs, which really don't have either relationships, the brand or the scale to do some of the things that we have been doing. We operate, we believe in an industry that has a long runway for growth, and we think that differentiated business model that we had, will provide us with many ways to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead. We feel good about the results we have generated, by focusing on the four strategic imperatives that Jeff and I discussed, not only in our prepared remarks, but certainly through the questions. And again, just once again, thanks for all of you for joining us today and for your continued interest in American Express.\nEdmund Reese: With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Jeff and Steve, and thank you to those of you on the phone. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions. Operator, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T executive teleconference service.

The discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the Company\u2019s reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to the comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2018 earnings release and presentation slides as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some key points related to the quarter\u2019s results through the series of presentation slides. Once Jeff completes his remarks, we\u2019ll move to a Q&A session. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well thanks, Toby, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we published our first quarter results and we are up to a solid start to the year 2018. Our FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the first quarter and earnings per share was $1.86. At our Investor Day in March, we took you through our plans to build on our strengths and to continue to invest across our four key focus areas to drive growth and capture opportunities across our business. When you look at our first quarter results, you see our focus and these investments paying off. We are expanding our leadership in the premium consumer segment, showing strong growth globally. We are building on our position in commercial payments, particularly with SMEs across the globe. Our digital efforts are accelerating as we integrate recently acquired digital capabilities and make steady progress on digital engagement with our customers. And our network is bringing it all together, powering revenue growth across our many customer segments and geographies. So with this context, let me turn to the financial performance on Slide 2. First quarter revenues of $9.7 billion grew 10% adjusted for FX and reflected solid growth across billings, loans, and fee income. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 31% from a year-ago. Earnings per share was $1.86 for the quarter, up 38% from the prior year. I\u2019d remind you that our first quarter results reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in a significant reduction in our tax provision. And like many U.S. companies, we expect to see some modest adjustments related to the Tax Act throughout the year. However, if you take a step back from the tax impact and we're to just simply apply our lower Q1 2018 effective tax rate to the prior year, adjusted EPS growth would still have been in the double digits. I'd also point out that despite the suspension of our share repurchases for the first half of 2018, our EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in shares outstanding, stemming from the $3.5 billion in share repurchases we have done over the last four quarters. Looking at the details behind our performance, I'll start with Billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 3 through 5. In total, worldwide Billed business growth accelerated sequentially to 10% on an FX adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 4, the growth continues to be solid across all of our segments. To get more specific on Slide 5, you see a view of billings by customer segment. This slide also serves as a helpful reminder that our global commercial and global consumer segments are roughly the same size comprising 41% and 42% of Q1 billings respectively, while global network services makes up the remaining 17% of billings. Starting on the left, our small and mid-sized enterprise customers or SMEs continue to represent some of our highest growth opportunities. U.S. SME billings growth was 10%, up sequentially from last quarter's 9%, and international SME billings growth was 20% for a second consecutive quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The large and global customer segment growth rate was up to 8% on an FX adjusted basis this quarter compared to 6% last quarter. On a related note, you can see in our earnings tables that for the Company overall both our global airline volumes and U.S. T&E spending were up sequentially compared to Q4. We also saw continued growth in B2B payments. Moving to U.S. Consumer, which makes up 30% of the Company's billings, growth was 11% up from 8% in the prior quarter. This quarter we completed the acquisition of the portion of the Hilton portfolio that we did not already own, which contributed around 80 basis points to U.S. Consumer billings growth in the first quarter. We also continue to see strong growth in our U.S. Platinum franchise, but I would remind you that we will fully lap the value proposition changes we made in 2017 beginning with the next quarter. More broadly, we saw acceleration in spend by our existing customers this quarter, reflecting both our continued focus on customer engagement and an increase in consumer spending and confidence within our premium customer base in the U.S. and around the globe. In fact, moving to the right, you do also see an uptick in sequential growth at international proprietary consumer which is up 16% on an FX adjusted basis compared to 14% in Q4. We continue to have robust proprietary growth in key markets, such as, Australia up 27%, the UK up 20%, and Japan up 15% all on an FX adjusted basis. Global network services is the one place where billings growth rates declined sequentially as they were up 3% on an FX adjusted basis in Q1 versus 6% in Q4. As we have said for some time, we expect the regulation in Europe and Australia to continue to impact volume in this business. Outside of these two markets, our GNS business experienced double-digit growth. Overall, we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 6. Our total loan growth accelerated 16% in Q1. Here again, I would point to the acquisition of the remaining Hilton portfolio as a contributor to the sequential acceleration. This acquisition contributed about 140 basis points to our total loan growth this quarter. On the right hand side of the slide, net interest yield was 10.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially. As you know, we typically see a seasonal increase in yield in the first quarter compared to the prior year yield was up 50 basis points. As we've been saying for some time, we expect net interest yield, which has been steadily growing sequentially to stabilize somewhat. As a result, we expect the year-over-year growth in net interest income to slow from current levels as we progress through the year. Now before we turn to credit, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our interest expense and funding costs in more detail than I usually do as we have been getting some questions in this area. You all know that we are liability sensitive given that our asset mix includes charge card receivables that are not interest-bearing. Our funding strategy is to be active in three markets; deposits, asset backed securities, and unsecured debt. We have about $67 billion of deposits with about $32 billion coming from sweep accounts and CDs, which tend to move in line with market rates. The remaining $35 billion in deposits is coming from our online personal savings program. In a rising rate environment, this is generally our least expensive source of funding. We expect to continue to grow our online savings program steadily over the next few years facilitated by the recent consolidation of our two U.S. banks. In terms of rate sensitivity, since the Fed started raising rates back in mid-2016, our beta has been about 0.45, but trending up. Of late, our beta is closer to 0.6 roughly in line with the 0.7 that we are using for our own internal planning. When you look at our other floating rate debt, we have recently seen some compression in the spread between our funding rates and prime, which is putting more pressure on net interest yields than we had originally anticipated in our planning. Here, I would remind you of the sensitivity communicated in our 10-K that a 10 basis point change in the spread between prime and one-month LIBOR will have about a $33 million impact on our net interest income over the following 12 months. Stepping back, I would just remind you that a rising rate environment generally represents a modest headwind for us usually mitigated in part by a stronger economic environment. As I think about the balance of 2018, the latest consensus for steady rate hikes by the Fed represents the modest, but growing challenge as we go through the year. So let\u2019s move on to credit metrics, which you see on Slide 7. Starting on the left with the lending portfolio, the loss rate for the quarter was 2.0%, up about 30 basis points from last year, and as you know from a sequential perspective, there is usually a seasonal increase in the first quarter. We have been saying for some time that we expect an increase in lending write-off rates primarily due to the mix shift of our portfolio over time towards non-cobrand products and the seasoning of loans. On the right side, you can see loss rates in our charge portfolio as well as the global corporate payments loss ratio. Our loss rate on charge was 1.6%. Now we often look at our charge performance as one useful indicator, the macroeconomic environment given the short duration of these assets. While there is a movement from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonality, the charge write-off rate is in fact down from a year-ago, which we see as a positive reflection on the broader status of our tenured premium customer base. Given these credit metrics and moving to Slide 8, provision was $775 million and we built reserves of $124 million in the first quarter. We have said that we expect provision growth for the full-year 2018 to be in the mid-30% range, which is exactly where we were this quarter at 35%. The provision growth reflects the acceleration in loan growth and the increase in lending credit metrics, all of which were within our expectations. We remain focused on capturing more of our customers borrowing activities on attractive economic terms and believe that our provision outlook remains appropriate for the year. So we may have some variability in the growth rate from quarter-to-quarter. Turning now to revenues on Slide 9. FX adjusted revenue growth was 10% in the first quarter. I would remind you that this is the first quarter in which we are reporting under the new revenue recognition standard. As we said at Investor Day, for us the new standard drives changes in P&L geography with minimal change to revenue growth rates or earnings. To be clear, all of our historical numbers that we are discussing today have been recast, so that they are on a comparable basis to our Q1 2018 numbers. I\u2019ll spend a little time on the areas most impacted by the change in a few minutes. Moving to Slide 10 for the revenue drivers, we see solid performance across all components of revenue. I would point out that we are benefiting from FX in our reported numbers across many of these lines. Our total reported revenue growth was 12%, 200 basis points higher than the FX adjusted growth rate of 10%. Discount revenue was up 9%, which I'll come back to in a minute. Net card fees growth was 11% driven by key international markets as well as Platinum and Delta in the U.S. Others fees and commissions were up 10%. Other revenue was up 4%, returning to positive growth this quarter as we have now lapped the sale of a small business in Q4, 2016. And net interest income was up 23% driven by the growth in loans and yield that I just mentioned a few moments ago. Now knowing that many of you have been focused on our discount revenue trends, I wanted to provide a bit more color around them on Slide 11, as this is our largest revenue source. I\u2019ll start by noting that the new revenue recognition standard moves certain items from contra-discount revenue down to expenses. While this impacts the absolute levels of several of the numbers on the page, it does not materially change trends or themes. Starting on the left, discount rate in Q1 was 2.37%, down 6 basis points from a year-ago, right in line with the expectations that we shared at our Investor Day. As you may recall from our Investor Day discussion, we are focused on driving discount revenue growth not on maximizing the discount rate, which has led us to selectively adjust the rate in order to drive higher volume growth and overall economics. The results of this strategy are illustrated on the right side of Slide 10 where you see the benefits of such trade offs. In the last three quarters, our discount revenue growth has accelerated even as discount rate has declined with discount revenue reaching 8% FX adjusted growth in Q1. We believe that our decisions to selectively adjust the rate to drive volumes by expanding merchant coverage and deepening relationships with key strategic partners have been important to achieving such strong discount revenue momentum. And more broadly, we are particularly pleased in Q1 to see that roughly 6 of the 10 points of FX adjusted revenue growth came from spend and fee portions of our business model. If you think about this in the context of the total P&L, 81% of our revenue in Q1 was driven by card spending and fee income illustrating the spend in fee centric nature of our business model. Turning now to expenses on Slide 12. I\u2019ll cover the components of Customer Engagement, Marketing and Business Development, Card Member Rewards and Card Member Services on the next slide. Now let me cover our operating expenses first. Operating expenses were up 5% on a reported basis, but only up approximately 2% on an FX adjusted basis in the quarter. The quarter contained a number of discrete items, such as the loss on a transaction involving our prepaid operations that we were expecting and that we first discussed last year. These recharges were partially offset by valuation gains on our Amex ventures investment portfolio, stemming from the implementation of the new accounting guidance for financial instruments. Most importantly, we expect full-year growth in operating expenses to be consistent with our historical ability to drive operating expense leverage. So now let's turn to Customer Engagement where you can see on Slide 13 that a $4.1 billion in the first quarter, it is up 12% from the prior year. As I talk you through the components, I\u2019d remind you that there are several impacts to these numbers from the new revenue recognition standard. Starting at the bottom, we have the new Marketing and Business Development line. As we covered at Investor Day, it has two components. Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses and then payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks, and cobrand partners. This line in total is up 5% versus the prior year. Our traditional marketing however is actually down a bit year-over-year as we continue to make great progress underwriting steady acquisition efficiencies as we highlighted at Investor Day. Even with this spend down a bit; we acquired 3.5 million new cards during the quarter compared to 2.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Now obviously this quarter\u2019s number includes cards coming from the recent Hilton portfolio acquisition. But even excluding Hilton, we still saw double-digit year-over-year card acquisition growth despite the lower marketing spending. So the increase in the overall marketing and business development line is driven by partner payments, primarily related to investments in our recent cobrand agreements as well as growth in our corporate business. Moving up to Rewards. As I said at Investor Day, rewards are expected to grow roughly in line with billings which you saw during Q1 as rewards expense was up 14% from the prior year just slightly higher than the 13% growth in our proprietary billings. As a reminder, as a result of revenue recognition changes, our rewards line now includes all our rewards costs including those for cashback reward. Moving then to the top of the Slide, Card Member services costs were up 29% driven by engagement with our premium services, such as airport lounge access and first bag free on our Delta cobrand. As I said in Investor Day, I expect card member services to continue to be the fastest growing expense line on a percentage basis, given our focus on providing differentiated services for our customers and others would find difficult to replicate. Looking forward to the balance of the year, I do see Q1 as the low point for marketing and business development spend primarily for two reasons. First, as we talked about on our Q4 earnings call in January, we increased investments for 2018 by $200 million for the full-year as a result of the impact of the Tax Act. Given the late timing of that decision, we chose to allocate all of that spending to the latter three quarters of the year. Second, I hope that all of you have by now seen that we have launched a new global brand campaign this month. We are excited about the long-term prospects of this campaign. But as you would expect, as a result we will spend significantly more on media and brand in the balance of the year than we did in Q1. Turning last to capital on Slide 14. As we announced on our January earnings call given the $2.6 billion charge we took in Q4 related to the Tax Act, we suspended share repurchases for the first half of 2018. We are rebuilding capital and our common equity Tier 1 ratio has increased to 9.4% at the end of the first quarter. Looking forward, we have now made our CCAR 2018 submission. Our CCAR ask is consistent with our aim to restore capital to our target levels and distribute capital to shareholders while supporting business growth. Over time, we plan to move back to a steady state common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10% to 11%. We will hear back from the Fed on our CCAR submission in June. We expect to continue deploying capital to support our organic asset growth and feel good about our ability to generate capital well in excess of those business needs. Based on what I know today, I would conclude by saying that we feel confident that we will resume share repurchases in the second half of the year. So that brings us to our outlook and then I will take your questions. You have by now read in our press release that we now expect full-year revenue growth of at least 8%. Given our solid performance in the first quarter, we now expect full-year EPS to be at the high end of our EPS guidance range of $6.90 to $7.30. To put this into context, let me make a few comments. First, we are only 90 days into the year, it is still early. Second, as we've said before, moving forward on the revenue side we well over time lapse the impact of our U.S. Platinum refreshes see a moderation of the year-over-year increases in net yield and face the likely modest headwind of a steadily rising interest rate environment. On the expense side, you will see higher marketing in business development spend as we go through the year for the reasons I just went through a few minutes ago. So we feel good about our plans for the year and believe that as always they will allow us to balance the short and long-term growth goals of the Company while meeting our commitments to shareholders. We have a differentiated business model that positions us to win and we are focused on delivering steady and consistent revenue and EPS growth. One final point, which relates to our Investor Relations team here at American Express, after three years leading Investor Relations, Toby Willard is moving to a new role within Amex as the CFO of our Global Merchant and Network Services Business. I'd like to thank Toby for leading the IR function during a pivotal time for the Company. The last few years have been particularly challenging and Toby has faced them with an impressive show of steady and calm insights, wisdom and advice that we have all come to value. He has also picked a good time to take on his new role given the solid momentum that we have built as a Company and that you see in our first quarter results. I'd also like to welcome Edmund Reese, our new Head of Investor Relations. Edmund was most recently the CFO of our U.S. Consumer and Global Consumer Lending Business and has had a number of key finance positions over his nine years with the Company. Edmund knows a tremendous amount about our business and brings towards every day a passion for making sure we succeed. I know I will enjoy working with Edmund, as I\u2019m sure will all of you. With that, let me turn it back to Toby one last time.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Jeff and thanks for those kind words. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask everybody in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. And with that, I'll turn it back over to you David. You can open up the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. And congrats Toby, and welcome Edmund. Jeff, it seems like you think that you can get the type of leverage you saw in Card Member acquisition cost as we saw this quarter going forward because of the cobrand renewal impacts and a slightly maybe more benign competitive environment relative to the past. Is that a fair statement? And then maybe just on the T&E spending, you mentioned the higher airline and T&E. Is that a function of businesses reinvesting money as a result of tax reform or do you think it's just improved sentiments?\nJeffrey Campbell: Let me take those in order Sanjay. On the acquisition side, really the biggest thing I would point to are the themes that Doug Buckminster in particular spend a lot of time on at Investor Day and that is our relentless focus over the last couple of years on constantly driving more efficiency into our new Card Member acquisition efforts particularly by getting better every quarter, every year in terms of our digital acquisition efforts. And that is really the largest most important and most sustainable aspect of what is allowing us to moderate marketing and promotional spend while still getting really terrific results in terms of acquiring new Card Members, and I really look to that as opposed to any particular change in the broader competitive environment, and as you know we believe we have a long run, we have continued improvement in those areas. On the subject of T&E spend, certainly in many areas we saw a tick-up sequentially in what we would call internally organic spend growth, so the rate of growth amongst our existing customers. We saw that in U.S. consumer. We saw it in consumers spending outside the U.S. and you see it when you look at the airline volumes as well as the T&E spending. So there's clearly something going on amongst our more premium oriented customer base. The only thing I'm reluctant, Sanjay, to go further on is, it\u2019s difficult for us. We can type lots of anecdotes from discussions with individual consumers or individual corporate clients. It's harder for us to comment on what's going on in all of their minds that\u2019s driving this increased confidence. As you know, when you look at the broader external economic indicators right now, it's hard to see a big inflection point in economic growth or confidence. What I will tell you though is what we see in our numbers is when you consider the nature of our consumer and commercial Card Member base is not necessarily broadly representative, but it\u2019s more premium oriented. There is clearly something going on with increased confidence and increased spending.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks Sanjay.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hi, Eric.\nEric Wasserstrom: Hi. And Toby thanks very much for all the help over the years. I really appreciate it.\nToby Willard: Great.\nEric Wasserstrom: Jeff, thanks very much for the explanation on the cost of funds, but would you mind maybe just going back through for this period maybe doing an attribution in terms of how much of the increase was attributable to change in yields or what was occurring in terms of the asset side and maybe what was occurring on the deposit side more specifically intra quarter?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well let me take a stab, and if I\u2019m not answering exactly what you are after maybe we\u2019ll let you stay on and follow-up, even though we\u2019re trying to follow Toby\u2019s rule of one question. Most simplistically if you think about this at start at the top, we had 23% growth in net interest income on 16% growth low. So you've obviously got a 7% added lift there from what's happening on yield, net interest yield was up 50 basis points. When you look at that net interest yield increase of net 50 basis points in the quarter year-over-year for us, the impact of rising rates was fairly close to neutral. So the 50 basis point increase in rates is really coming for us in this quarter from the evolving mix, so we have fewer people on introductory rates, more people who are paying full rates, as well as the continued effect of various pricing actions that we've been talking about for over a year now as we more thoughtfully price for risk and as we more thoughtfully price competitively. So that's really what drove the 50 basis points and the effect of interest rates in this particular quarter was pretty neutral. Is that helpful and is that what you're after?\nEric Wasserstrom: Yes. That's very helpful. And just if I can just clarify one component of that. So as we think about the dynamics around deposit beta, which you\u2019ve underscored and this \u2013 the issue of higher rates starting to take effect beginning presumably this quarter. Do I understand your guidance to be about a net-net year-over-year improvement over the course of 2018 in terms of net yield or is there some risk of a compression year-over-year?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well let me be clear on what I said. So certainly if the Fed in fact raises rates as the current consensuses would call for, the pure interest rate component given where betas have been most recently is likely to become a modest headwind for us. So that then leaves you with the impact of the pricing actions, we will continue to be thoughtful about as well as evolving mix. Now I clearly expect the 50 basis point year-over-year increase to begin to moderate. Our job Eric is to do everything we can to manage the Company in the way that the moderation is as small as possible and that\u2019s what we're seeking to do as a team. So we'll have to see just how successful we are making the moderation very small versus large.\nToby Willard: So operator, maybe we'll go to the next question. Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hey, Mark.\nMark DeVries: Hey, thanks. So my question has to do with \u2013 I just want to think through the pace of the moderation in the business growth that was \u2013 we should see a couple things there to deconstruct. I think you've alluded to several times, Jeff, the lapping of Platinum. But I'm assuming that's not going to be \u2013 that's going to be kind of a gradual thing, right because you've probably had ramping engagement, you also had the delay and the imposition of the increased fee for certain customers. And then you also in response to Sanjay\u2019s question, alluded to obviously some change in the organic growth. Are you seeing that continue to accelerate and potentially providing a bit of a tailwind to that lapping effect?\nJeffrey Campbell: So good questions, Mark. First off, look on Platinum, I'm just being factual in that value proposition changes we made on the consumer side, we're all in by March of last year. So next quarter will be the first quarter where you completely lap them. The changes we made on the business Platinum side we've already begun to lap. So look we've had tremendous performance in our Platinum portfolio and on the consumer side, where you saw us put a lot more value into the card and price for that value. We are now well over six months into applying the new fee to people as they renew the card and I will tell you the attrition rates have not moved at all. So we feel really good and I think our customers feel really good about the value proposition. Now certainly as you fully lap all the changes, we would expect some moderation in some ways I'm going to give you an answer a little bit like I just gave Eric. We're doing everything we can to try to make that moderation in growth rates as we fully lap the value proposition changes as modest as possible, but there will certainly be some moderation. We\u2019ll just have to see how great it is as we get into next quarter. The other thing I would flag is I think at this point have been pretty clear that there was clearly something going on with organic spend growth across our customer base as you look at this quarter. And here I guess I just point you back to my \u2013 we're only 90 days into the year. If there's one thing that probably surprised us a little bit in this quarter's results, Mark it would be that increase while we have been steadily seeing that number increase for many quarters now due to the things we've been doing. There seem to be almost a little bit of an inflection point this quarter that well I\u2019d like to take credit for it I think it's probably a little greater than anything being driven by our steady continuous effort. So 90 days into the year, I'm a little cautious about exactly what's driving that, is it going to sustain itself, we\u2019ll just have to see. So those are probably the two biggest uncertainties I would say in our minds as I sit here on April 18 and think about the billings and volumes trends that we might see in the coming couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hey, Craig.\nCraig Maurer: Hey, good evening and let me add my congratulations for Toby. Just forward to the long-term question, if memory serves correctly, a few years ago you talked about in a steady state 6% revenue growth environment, OpEx \u2013 you felt you could hold the line on OpEx growth at 2% or less. Is that still something we should be thinking about with revenue growth higher; right now does that change, so just your long-term thinking on OpEx would be helpful? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, Craig I\u2019ll make a few comments. First off, our number one focus is driving steady and consistent revenue and earnings per share growth and we have lots of levers to achieve that. Second thing I would say is as you know we have a tremendous 10-year track record of steadily getting leverage on the operating expense side. And in many forums we will talk about the fact that if you look at the last 10 years, you've seen our operating expenses grow at a CAGR of 1% or 2% when volumes were growing at tremendous rates. And I'd also point out to you that Steve Squeri in addition to his many other areas of focus and strength has always been a particular believer in the power of our integrated model and our ability to build scale economies given the nature of our integrated business model. So we are very confident in our ability to get steady operating expense leverage. All I'm going to resist a little bit is being real precise about the exact number in any given year because there will be times when it will make sense to put more money into things like our digital capabilities, into things like the many, many sales forces that we run in many of our businesses across the globe. At times those are things that will cause us to increase operating expenses frankly and allow us to pull down things like marketing expenses and get a better result. So I'm going to be cautious about giving you an exact number Craig. But under any circumstances, you should expect to see us continue to get steady operating expense leverage.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hey, Don.\nDonald Fandetti: Yes, Jeff. I was curious if you saw any benefit this quarter delinquencies from the consumer tax reform? I think at the Investor Day, there was some commentary about possibly seeing some benefit? And then secondarily on credit, you've been growing an SME international consumer? How do you sort of compare and contrast the forecasting a rescue of those areas versus U.S. consumer?\nJeffrey Campbell: Don, just sorry, can you give me a little more color on your second question and just what you're after and then I'll hit them both?\nDonald Fandetti: Sure. So you've been growing the SME small business has been growing pretty rapidly on the lending side, also international consumer and as you sort of think about forecasting credit and variability, how do you sort of think about those areas versus U.S. consumer and are they tracking in line with your projected loss curves as well?\nJeffrey Campbell: Good. So let me start with the tax reform. It\u2019s always a little careless, I think, Don, for us to speculate on what drives particular consumer behavior. Certainly the facts are that we saw in the U.S., a clear sequential uptick in spending by consumers and you can speculate on whether that's confidence or greater economic growth or something to do with the Tax Act. When I look at the provision, I would tell you that relative to our expectations, while the provision on a percentage basis came in about exactly like we would have expected year-over-year. In fact the rate \u2013 the delinquencies, the rates were probably a tiny bit better than we\u2019ve expected in our lending volumes were a little bit higher and they netted out to give you a provision that was right in line with what we expected. So those are the facts. I guess I'd be a little reluctant to try to draw direct lines between the Tax Act and any of those specifics. Now you are correct. We're getting nice to grow in both our international consumer lending portfolio as well as our corporate lending, which mostly mean small and mid-size enterprise lending portfolios. I would point out to everyone remind you all that the U.S. consumer business is still the predominant portion of our lending. But the SME lending is also still predominately in the U.S. and I\u2019d say we really feel we have the same exact insights in handle there that we do on the consumer side. The only things I make on international consumer is that of course is done in multiple markets, which have very different characteristics. So there are some markets we operate in that are extremely attractive, but have by nature higher write-off rates and generally much higher yields that compensate for that and produce really good economics. And so within any given market, obviously we feel we have a very good handle on the risks in the forecast and where we're going. When you look at that aggregate international number, I will say of the average of a lot of very different things. So it's a little tougher to generalize about it. So that's probably the way I would take you through the landscape.\nDonald Fandetti: Thanks Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks Don.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks guys for taking my questions. And Toby, it's really been a pleasure over the years. So thank you very much.\nToby Willard: Thanks, Rick.\nRichard Shane: Jeff, I\u2019d love to ask sort of \u2013 a little bit of a strategic question. Our view is that the reduction in tax rates is probably likely going to change the competitive landscape to some of those excess returns or completed the lag. One of the places is that at least historically and more recently we've seen that is on the reward side, which frankly when rewards raise really heated up, I think it adversely affected American Express. How do you see this evolving over the next year if the rewards will raise really picks up again?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, Rick, I guess I'd say a few things. We are focused on driving steady revenue and earnings per share growth for our shareholders. We\u2019re focused on providing tremendous value propositions for our Card Members, and we think we have a lot of tremendous value propositions out in the marketplace today. As I said here today, I feel really good about our value propositions. I don't feel the need to do anything dramatic in response to what else is out there. We feel fabulous about the progress we've made on Platinum and when you look at our growth rates in every customer and geographic segment this quarter, I think you have to conclude that we have great value propositions. We have also really focused the last couple years on evolving our value propositions in ways that try to leverage the unique differentiated assets we have. And the growth you see in the Card Member services line is a part of that, but our global scale, the size of our premium customer base, our brand, we closely model, all of those things allow us to do things with a variety of partners and to do things like our global lounge program that are we believe difficult for others to match. And as an aside, Rick I'd say it's often difficult for people to quantify in the many reward comparisons that people sometimes do. So our job is to do provide great value propositions to Card Members to produce steady returns for shareholders. Frankly, I don't see anything about the Tax Act that should change strategies we are implying to do either of those two things. Obviously we'll have to see how the environment evolves, but we feel good about where we are today and we feel good about the results we just posted.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Congrats to Toby and maybe some condolences over to Edmund. I guess maybe just following up on that point, in the last couple days we saw some new info both from yourselves and from Chase on the Marriott and Starwood\u2019s programs, and I mean I guess the way it looked is that Chase is going to have kind of a head start of a few months and it's kind of going out with \u2013 back with 100,000 points which certainly something that grab some headlines. Can you talk about how you think about the competitive dynamics in that context both for that specific portfolio and whether that might kind of ignite a trend over the course of the next year?\nJeffrey Campbell: I\u2019d say couple things Moshe. First, we feel great about our relationship with Marriott, which is a broad multifaceted relationship cuts across our travel business, our cobrands, our merchant acceptance relationships, things we do with MR, very broad relationship produces a lot of value for us. We believe it produces a lot of value for Marriott and we believe it offers some great value to Card Members. We\u2019ve run the company for the long-term in the grand scheme of things. We don't worry too much about a couple months in the marketplace one way or another. Next thing I\u2019d say is really broadly speaking; we have more different value propositions in the marketplace by far than any of our competitors. And we do that very thoughtfully because we believe that every Card Member has a little different set of things that they value and so that's why we have different tiers whether you want to look at our proprietary charge products, whether you want to look at our different proprietary credit products, that\u2019s why when you look at many of our largest cobrand partnerships you see us offering multiple products because people do not all issue the same things. And in particular with all of those products, our ability to offer a differentiated set of assets meaning on our brand, meaning on our global scale, meaning on some of the unique assets we can bring to bear, we think make our value propositions tremendously strong. So the particular competitor you mentioned certainly made a lot of noise in the marketplace with some offers that lot of people thought were pretty extreme about two years ago, we just finished the year 2017 with the highest number of Platinum card members we've ever had with the most spending by those Card Members despite raising the fees if we paid for that card. So we feel really good about our value proposition. We feel really good about the partnership we have with Marriott and we think that the marketplace over time will really recognize the value that we're putting into our Marriott value propositions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you, and Toby, thanks for all your help, and Edmund, look forward to working with you, really appreciated Toby. On the international business and international small business, and consumers getting close to 20% of your business in the growth rates are \u2013 I popping in some regards, I mean Australia 27%, UK 20%, SME 20%? Can you just talk a little bit more about what you expect for those businesses, obviously you not those types of growth rates? Are you benefiting from regulation and not being you know having American Express regulated or is it merchant coverage? What do you think \u2013 what do your expectations for those businesses over the long-term, other growing very fast just still relatively small relative to the TAM that's out there?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, let me maybe take those one at a time and let me starts Bob with the small and mid-sized enterprise business. We have as you know in the U.S. a tremendously valuable franchise with small businesses. We see ourselves as being the first into that marketplace. We're very focused on providing all the kinds of specialized services and products that are value in that marketplace and that\u2019s been tremendous thing for us. I would say over the years, we probably haven\u2019t replicated that level of focus outside the U.S. in that marketplace, until we made that decision as part of the many things we did to help reposition the company over the last few years to combine under one leader at the time, it was Steve, all of our global small and large commercial businesses. And it's really at that point that we began to refocus on taking all the learnings frankly that we have from the U.S. and bring them to the SME market in many other countries around the globe. And outside the U.S., I would say we view this is still a pretty underdeveloped market, where \u2013 well in varies and each country that we're in, the competitive environment is probably not quite as developed as it is in the U.S. So we feel great about the 20% growth you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters and we would see a very long runway even focus we now have in this area to continue it. Now on the proprietary consumer side, the bottom line as we also see a long runway to continue to grow above the market. If you look at the most recent quarter, it's too early to have all the comparative data. But I would suspect that in probably all of our top 10 markets now we are growing faster in the industry we're still small - those markets though and we actually put those two things together and say that's part of our gives us a long runway to continue to grow a little faster than the market and it's our ability to offer really differentiated value propositions versus the competition in all of those markets. Now, I will say Australia you have some dynamics because Australia we are in the process of shutting down our network business and that is helping to create opportunities for us to find people who really value the American Express brand and what we can offer and put great proprietary products into their hand. But we more broadly see a long runway to grow outside the U.S. both with small businesses as well as in a consumer marketplace. So thanks Bob.\nToby Willard: David, do you have any other question?\nOperator: Okay, I believe if we have time for one more question. We'll take one from the line of Ken Bruce from Bank of America.\nKenneth Bruce: Thank you for sliding me in here before the end of the call. Toby, good luck. Thank you very much for all your help over the years. I am going to pick up really where you left off, Jeff, if I may. As I look at the proprietary businesses, you've had some fantastic growth rates. And obviously, the reorienting of the strategy back towards proprietary has had a lot of success and I think that's got momentum to it. As we look at GNS, it looks like it's about to go into negative growth, you\u2019ve pointed out Europe and Australia. I remember back when we first got into the network business and more size, it was always pointed out as to be a very high ROE business. And I'm interested in what you think the terminal size of that business may ultimately look like and what the impact will be on the overall ROE of the business or you think it\u2019s just gets lost in the numbers at some point?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes. Well, Ken the real answer is what you just said, which is that we are focused on driving steady returns, no matter where we find them across the business. The GNS business, because of regulation in Europe and Australia will be a little smaller year from now than it is now that will not have any material impact on the overall companies ROE. And as I just pointed out in response to Bob\u2019s question, there are some really great growth opportunities that we're pursuing in light of the shrinking of that network business in a few places. So GNS is an important part of our broader long-term strategy and plays a critical role in many, many places around the globe, but it will continue to evolve. And we will not get locked into any one strategy, but we will always be looking for where we can find the best opportunities to deploy capital efficiency and produce great differentiated returns. End of Q&A\nToby Willard: Great. Thanks Jeff, and thank you everybody for joining tonight's call. David, we will wrap it up there.\nOperator: All right. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you again for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "AXP", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-24 13:38:07", "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the American Express Q4 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that the instructions for entering the queue have changed. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please go ahead.\nRosie Perez: Thank you, Liya, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the Company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the Company's progress and results. And then, Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our performance. After that, we'll move to Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Rosie. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to report that our 2019 fourth quarter and full-year results continued the steady consistent performance that we've delivered over the past two years. Our strong top-line growth continued with revenues growing 9% in the quarter. This marks our 10th straight quarter of FX-adjusted revenue growth at or above 8%. Once again, our revenue growth was broad-based, driven by well-balanced mix of fees, spend and lend. We added 11.5 million new proprietary cards in 2019, delivered solid billings growth, and continue to grow loans while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics. These results show that our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance is working. This strategy is the heart of our financial model and it gives us confidence that in today's economic environment, we can sustain high levels of revenue growth, which is the foundation for steady double-digit earnings growth. My confidence in our ability to generate consistent solid results over the longer term is based on several factors. The fundamental strengths we derive from our differentiated business model, the significant growth opportunities we see across our business, and our demonstrated success in executing our investment strategy against the four strategic imperatives I laid out two years ago. Let me take a few minutes to share some of the highlights of the progress we made on each of these strategic imperatives in 2019. We expanded our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing our disciplined strategic approach of refreshing our premium charge products and upgrading our co-brand portfolios globally. In all these cases, we've added features that our card members value. Acquisitions remain strong and approximately 70% of our new card members are choosing fee-based products, which help to drive 17% growth in subscription-like fee revenues for the year. Our new card members are skewing younger and are more digitally engaged. Our refreshed products are also enabling us to reengage with our existing customer base, where we are seeing increased organic spend, all-time high net promoter scores and steady retention. In our commercial business, we've taken our successful approach to strategic product refreshes and applied it to our business card portfolio in the U.S. and select markets around the world. In addition to the refreshes, we've expanded our commercial card offerings with the introduction of several new products for business customers of all sizes. And to deepen our relationships with our business customers, we continued our focus on growing our non-card product offerings, by expanding our AP automation solutions, as well as offering a variety of lending and flexible payment programs to help our business customers manage cash flow and grow their businesses. In total, over the past two years, we've refreshed and launched over 50 proprietary products across both our commercial and consumer businesses around the world, resulting in greater customer engagement and strong new card acquisitions which are driving our revenue growth. Turning to the network business. In 2016, we set an ambitious goal of achieving virtual parity coverage in the United States by the end of 2019. Setting this goal was a recognition of the fundamental importance that our merchant network plays in driving growth across our businesses and to galvanize our organization\u2019s focus on achieving it. I'm very pleased to report that as of year-end 2019, based on our internal tracking and our understanding of the latest industry data, we have achieved virtual parity coverage with approximately 99% of credit card accepting merchants in the U.S. now able to accept the American Express card. Of course, we recognize that virtual parity coverage will always be a moving target. The merchant landscape is dynamic with hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses opening and closing every year. Therefore, we will continue to focus on maintaining virtual parity coverage in the U.S. in 2020 and beyond. We're also making good progress to increase coverage across our international markets, where our card members live, work and travel to the most. And this will continue to be a focus for us. Going forward, as we continue to grow our network, we\u2019ll work with our merchant partners in the U.S. and around the world to ensure that our card members are warmly welcomed and encourage to spend in a millions of places where their Amex cards are accepted. Finally, I'm also pleased to report that the People's Bank of China officially accepted our network application, an important next step in our plan to build the network business in China. On a digital front, we've been hard at work, integrating acquisitions we've made over the last few years into our mobile app to provide our card members with premium access and experiences across a wide range of travel, dining and lifestyle services that differentiate us from our competitors. We are also working with our partners and our internal development teams to deliver a wide range of new online and mobile features, capabilities and services to help our customers manage their life and their business, efficiently and securely. Our goal in these initiatives is to deepen the digital ties we have with our customers, so the American Express becomes an indispensable part of their lives. And we're seeing good results as customer engagement with our digital channels is strong and growing. Today, 81% of our active card members are digitally engaged with us via our app and the website, and we\u2019ve seen a 26% increase year-over-year in the customers who use our mobile app daily. Those are just some of the highlights of our accomplishments in 2019. As I\u2019ve reported each quarter for the past two years, the progress we've made in each of these areas is driving our performance and shows that our financial model and investment strategy has generated sustainable growth. That's why we\u2019ll continue the strategic approach and why we are confident that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term. With that in mind, we expect to deliver revenue growth in 2020 of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis and earnings of $8.85 to $9.25. Looking ahead, our business is strong and our focus is clear. We have incredibly talented team at all levels and strong relationships with a wide array of outstanding business partners from our co-brand and digital partners to our millions of merchant partners around the globe, all working together to deliver the best products and services for our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2020 and beyond, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter and what was a solid year for American Express and to layout our expectations for 2020. I\u2019ll discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning, since it is our year-end call, and since looking at our performance on an annual basis is both more in line with how we actually manage the business and also gives us a better sense of the underlying trends. Turning to our summary financials on slide three. Fourth quarter revenues of $11.4 billion grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis and full-year revenues of $43.6 billion, also grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth as it has been all year continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of growth in fee, spend and lend revenues and was consistent with the high levels of revenue growth we\u2019ve delivered for over two years. This strong topline performance drove net income of $6.8 billion for the full year and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter. In understanding our year-over-year results, we do need to spend a minute on some discrete impacts in our reported results this year and last year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2018 contained $0.58 of positive adjustments for discrete tax items related to the Tax Act of 2017 and certain tax audits. In addition, as you remember, in the first quarter of this year, we had a $0.21 charge from the resolution of certain merchant litigation. If you adjust for these two impacts as we have done on slide three, full-year 2019 adjusted EPS was $8.20, up $0.12 versus the prior year adjusted EPS of $7.33, including the $2.03 of EPS in the fourth quarter, which was up 17% versus the prior year. Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on slides four through six. Starting on slide four, total FX-adjusted billed business growth was up 6% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We do think it is important to continue to break out the business growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we continue to see the impact of exiting our network business in Europe and Australia due to regulatory change. The 13% of our overall billings that comes from our network business, GNS, was down 1% in the fourth quarter and down 2% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as a result of the market exit. We do expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in the latter part of 2020 and return to positive levels of growth. Our proprietary business, which makes up 87% of total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. Turning to slide five. As we have said throughout 2019, the proprietary billed business growth trends are consistent with the economic environment. Solid growth, but slower than the very robust growth we saw in 2018. You see this as you turn to slide six to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter. Starting with U.S. consumer, which made up 33% of the Company's billings in the fourth quarter and remains our largest customer segment. Billings were up 7%, in line with the 7% to 8% growth we have seen all year. This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers. These trends also highlight the relative strength of the consumer in the U.S. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the double digits at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In the fourth quarter, we saw growth moderate in Mexico and the UK sequentially, driven by external factors. The growth in the UK did remain in the mid-teens. And we continue to see strong growth in the mid-teens in our top markets across the European Union, as well as in Japan. Spending from our U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs, grew a solid 6% in the fourth quarter, in line with the third quarter. We continue to feel good about the steady acquisition results we're seeing in our U.S. SME customers and importantly as we think about 2020. We saw stabilization in this key customer segment in Q4. International SME remains our highest growing customer type, with 15% FX-adjusted billings growth in the fourth quarter. We feel great about the strong growth we saw throughout 2019 coming off of even higher levels of growth in 2018. Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we continue to believe we have a long runway to sustain strong growth going forward. And then for the relatively small part of our volumes, 9% this quarter, that come from large and global corporate card billings, we saw a decline of 1% on the fourth quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, similar to what we saw last quarter. As we\u2019ve said for years now, this is not a growth segment for us but is an important part of our merchant value development. Finally, on the far right, global network services was down 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven the market exits that I mentioned earlier. And if you were to adjust for those impacts, the remaining portion of GNS was up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with Q3. Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate. Turning now to loan performance on slide seven. Total loan growth was 8% in the fourth quarter with about 60% of our growth for the year coming from our existing customers. We continue to focus on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers borrowing. At the same time, as we\u2019ve been saying all year, we have increased our investments in premium products and that shift in portfolio mix coupled with some steady tightening we have done on the risk management side over the past couple of years has led to lower loan growth. The shift towards more premium products has also led to lower loan balances on promotional offers, which along with continued positive impacts from pricing for risk contributed to the 50 basis-point year-over-year increase in net interest yield in the fourth quarter, if you see on the right-hand side of slide seven. So, the combination of loan growth and yield increases drove the 12% growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter. Ultimately, we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth as the financial outcome of our lending strategy. And so, we are pleased with the stability in net interest income growth that we saw in 2019. Turning next to the credit metrics on slide eight, if you were to take an average for the year to smooth out the quarterly volatility, lending write-off rates were up 22 basis points and charge rates were up 14 basis points on average for the full year. This level of modest write-off rate increases in BAU environment is consistent with the expectations we have talked about for several years now. And as you can see on the bottom of the slide, delinquency rates have been relatively stable all year and the GCP loss ratio continued to actually be down year-over-year. These trends reflect both, the credit implications of our strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low unemployment rate. We continue to expect modest increases in our loss rates in 2020, consistent with the trends we've now seen for several years. Importantly, we still do not see anything in our portfolios that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios performed much better in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year. This brings us to provision expense, which grew 7% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The business decisions we made to shift more towards premium products along with tightening things a bit on the risk management side, both contributed to the loan growth, credit metrics and provision trends we saw in 2019. Moving forward, while there may be some variability in the monthly turns, we expect relatively steady loan growth in 2020. And as I mentioned a few moments ago from of credit perspective, we expect the kind of modest increases in loss rates year-over-year that we\u2019ve been seeing to continue. As a result of these dynamics, we do expect higher provision expense growth in 2020 than we saw in 2019. While we\u2019re on this subject of provision, yes, let me touch on CECL. As you know, the CECL accounting changes went into effect on January 1, 2020 for us as well as the rest of the industry. In our first quarter results, we\u2019ll report the implementation or day-one impact, which we estimate will increase credit reserves by about $1.2 billion. The increase will run net of tax through equity with no impact to earnings. I would remind you that a unique aspect of American Express is our charge card portfolio. So, although our card and other lending reserves will go up by approximately $1.7 billion, we will have an offset from the approximately $0.5 billion decrease in charge reserves, given the short life of those receivables. Now, as a reminder, this increase will not have a material impact on our capital ratios or our ability to return capital to shareholders, given our 30% plus return on equity in the multi-year phase-in period for regulatory capital purposes. Then, we get to the ongoing or as some would say, the day-two impact of accounting for CECL in our ongoing provision expense starting in the first quarter of 2020. Under our current outlook, we expect a relatively modest increase to our annual 2020 provision expense from the implementation of CECL. More significantly, I too expect that there will be more quarter-to-quarter volatility under CECL, compared to the previous methodology, though some of this volatility should net out over the course of the year, making our longstanding focus on annual results rather than quarterly results, even more pronounced in 2020. Now, let's get back to our results and turn to revenues on slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The focused execution of our strategy has delivered strong top-line revenue growth of 8% or more for the last 10 quarters on an FX-adjusted basis. This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both, the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019 and continues to be supported by a well-balanced mix of growth in fees, spend and lend revenues, as you see on slide 11. Net card fees remained the fastest growing revenue lineup, 17% for the full year and accelerating to 20% in the fourth quarter. We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers placed in our value propositions when they choose to pay the subscription-like fees. And we continue to see that the majority of our new card members, around 70%, are choosing our fee-based products as well. Supported by the continued execution of our product refreshment strategy and our focus on premium value proposition, we expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest-growing revenue line in 2020. We are confident in our ability to maintain strong card fee growth, given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and customer segments, as well as the high levels of engagement we see with new and existing card members. These high levels of engagement supported by the progress we've made around coverage, continue to drive steady growth in our largest and most important revenue line, discount revenue, which was up 6% for the full year and in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with billings. And net interest income grew at 12% for the full-year and in the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I mentioned a few moments ago. Looking ahead, I expect net interest income growth to continue to be a bit higher than loan growth, driven by continued benefits from pricing mix as well as the modest tailwind from 2019 rate cuts. Importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from fee and spend revenues remained at 80% for the full year and the fourth quarter, in line with history, and we expect that revenue composition to continue given our differentiated spend and fee-centric model. Moving on to expenses. On slide 13, overall expenses grew 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. There are three important items though impacting the quarter here that more or less offset, but are important to understand. First, there were a few positive income tax and other tax related developments in the quarter that show up in the low effective tax rate, as well as in the operating expense line. We then, as we often do, took the opportunity to reinvest the upside we saw relative to our original plans to do two important things for the long-term health of the business. First, we accelerated the funding of some incremental business growth initiatives, similar to what we did in last year's fourth quarter. And second, we accelerated some of the things we are doing to evolve our organizations for the future and improve operating efficiencies. And as a result, we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, which is included in the salary and benefits line in the tables that accompany our earnings release. As I mentioned before, the impact of these three items roughly offset one another. And you see the impacts across OpEx, marketing and business development, and the lower effective tax rates at the bottom of the page.  Looking at the full year, our OpEx growth of 8% was also impacted by the litigation-related charge we took in the first quarter of 2019 that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. And as I\u2019ve said previously, some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth, growth in sales force, growth in premium servicing and enhancements in digital capabilities caused us in 2019 to see more growth in operating expenses than we have seen in recent years, or importantly than we expect to see going forward. We have a long track record of generating operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. Going forward, we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so. Turning now to slide 14 to look at the trend in customer engagement expenses. Overall, customer engagement expenses for the full year grew 10% as a result of our investment strategy. Starting at the bottom, marketing and business development costs were up 10% for the full year, due to our continued focus on funding growth initiatives and in part the incremental impact of the 11-year extension of our longstanding partnership with Delta that we signed earlier this year. Moving on to rewards expense, you can see that it grew 8% and was broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth for the full year. And as we continue to evolve our value propositions and see high engagement with our premium benefits, card member services grew 25% for the full year. While there were some adjustments that caused slower growth in card member services in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products. Going forward, we continue to expect total customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues as we continue to invest in share, scale and relevance. Turning to capital on slide 15. We ended the year with a CET1 of 10.7%, near the top of our 10% to 11% target range. During the year, we increased our dividend by 10% and returned $6 billion of capital to our shareholders. This outcome is a testament to the 30%-plus return on equity that our financial model generates, as well as our focus on maintaining capital strength while consistently returning excess capital to our shareholders. As we\u2019ve said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans, and we do not believe that CECL will have a material impact on those plans. To sum up, we feel really good about our steady and consistent performance throughout 2019. Looking ahead, we see a long runway to sustain high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth in today's economic environment. That brings me for our outlook for 2020. And then, we'll open the call for your questions. Our guidance for 2020 is consistent with our financial growth algorithm. As Steve mentioned at the start of our call, we are introducing our 2020 earnings per share guidance at a range of $8.85 to $9.25. Our guidance does assume an economy that looks somewhat similar to 2019 and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. Consistent with the performance we've been delivering for over two years, this guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. And at current exchange rates, we'd expect a more modest headwind from FX in our reported growth than we saw in 2019. And as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest to drive those high levels of revenue growth. And so, we expect customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues, again in 2020. And we are committed to generating operating expense leverage by growing our 2020 OpEx at a slower pace than revenues and slower than the pace we saw in 2019. Looking at the drivers of our financial results, there are a few other key planning assumptions I'd highlight. As I mentioned earlier, we expect provision growth to be higher in 2020 than it was in 2019, including a relatively modest increase from CECL. We do expect CECL to drive more volatility quarter-to-quarter. And so, focusing on the full year results will be even more critical in 2020. In addition, we expect that our effective tax rate will be around 21% next year. In summary, we remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today's environment, double-digit EPS growth. As I look at our performance over the past two years and our expectations for 2020, they clearly demonstrate consistent execution against our strategy, as well as our financial growth algorithm. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rosie. Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thanks for your cooperation. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Good to see the solid guide for \u201820. Jeff, I wanted to confirm, does the EPS guidance include the negative impact of CECL?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, absolutely. So, when you think about the range we provided this year, Don, I would say, the normal thing of -- you have to think about a little stronger economy pushes us towards the higher end of the weaker economy which is why a lower end of range is there, and CECL is the other uncertainty. But absolutely, we are contemplating what I call the relatively modest impact of CECL in there. So, you should go with that as full GAAP guidance.\nDon Fandetti: And are you -- in your guidance, I mean, I assume we are sort of at the kind of trough of billed business here as you\u2019re lapping some tougher comps. Do you have an acceleration built in? And could you talk about the discount rate, [LDR] [ph] knowing that you are sort of willing to scale that up and down?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think what I would actually point you to is the remarks Steve started with. We had 10 straight quarters now, Don, of revenue growth, which is ultimately what we're focused on, in the 8% to 10% range. And the fourth quarter was another strong quarter of revenue growth. So, actually, when we look at that metric, which ultimately is the end goal of the mixture of everything we're doing with card fees, with pricing, loan growth, the billings, the discount rate, we actually see a lot of stability in the momentum that we\u2019re entering in terms of revenue growth.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. I think, the other point is that if you look over these 10 quarters, we've shown that there is an elasticity to our billed business that still continues to drive the high revenue growth. And so, given the high card fees, higher growth in card fees, the consistent performance we\u2019ve had from a net interest income perspective, billings can fluctuate up and down. The other thing I would point out is not all billings are created equally. So, we feel really comfortable with where we wound up and how we ended the year from a billings perspective.\nOperator: Next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. Steve, I have a question for you just on what inning you guys are in, in this kind of product launch and refresh cycle. And I'm assuming given you've done 50 already, but it's pretty late innings. And the reason I'm asking is, as you pointed out, it's been a big contributor to adding new customers, reengaging with existing ones, and presumably been really helpful in generating that strong revenue growth. And if we are in kind of later innings, what are you looking to as kind of the levers to continue to sustain that revenue growth?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. The interesting thing is, I wouldn't equate this to innings. I would equate this to baseball seasons, because the way you got to think about this is that, product refreshes can happen on a three to four-year basis. And so, we got to play a season all over again. And so, if you look at 50 refreshes over the last two years, there are still more to do within the existing portfolio. And by the time you get done, guess what? Some of your products are three and four years old now. So, I wouldn't think about this as a one-time thing. And I think, you have to think about this as continuous refreshment, because look, the reality is our customer base constantly changes. We're looking to appeal to new customers at all aspect. If you look at Platinum before we did the refresh, Platinum was not as attractive to millennials as is today. And if you look at the value and the benefits that we put on it, it\u2019s become a much more attractive product and most of our growth has come from millennial update. Look, we have -- since the refresh, we have 60% more Platinum cards than we did prior to that refresh, and over 50% of the new cards acquired to millennials. So, I wouldn\u2019t think about this as an innings game. I think about this as we constantly play the baseball season. And there is going to be another season and another season and another season. It's just going to be different. It's just going to be different card products. And when you look at our portfolio of card products, it's in hundreds. So, we have a ways to go.\nOperator: Next, we go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the network opportunities outside the U.S. I know you mentioned, Steve, that you\u2019ve essentially achieved parity in the U.S. now. And maybe you could give us a sense, because I know that was a three-year outlook that you gave I think last year. And where are we there? And should we expect acceleration? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, look, from an outside the U.S. perspective, obviously we\u2019re nowhere near where we are in the U.S. We identify the strategy that we wanted to increase overall coverage internationally by 20% over a three-year period. We talked about that at investor day. I say without giving specific metrics on this, we\u2019ve made progress. We expect to hit that 20% growth target over that three-year period. It's a very focused strategy and that we\u2019re looking at key cities, we\u2019re looking at the key cities that our card members travel to and that we have large card bases in. And we\u2019re also working with our network partners in markets that we do not have proprietary businesses to continue to grow that. And let's not forget our efforts in China. We are -- our license has been accepted, we are waiting for the final approval, and hopefully sometime this year, we will launch the network. And that will increase not only coverage in China, but what it will do is it will put more cards on the network as we engage with the Chinese banks to have more Chinese travelers as they go into -- and the reality is, they are going to go into a lot our European and Asian cities, which is going to put more demand and will actually then help drive more coverage. So, we're still committed to it and we continue to invest in it. And the other point I would make out is the U.S. is not done. From a U.S. perspective, as I said in my remarks, it is a moving feast. And so, what we need to do is to continue to sign those merchants that commence the business. And what we also need to do is to continue our efforts to have warm acceptance. And from a warm acceptance perspective, what we mean is decals on the doors. We put up over 1 million decals this year, just in the United States alone. And it\u2019s an education process as well, it's an education process for the merchants, and it's an education process for our card members that in fact the card is accepted. So, what we\u2019ve laid what we would call technical acceptance, there is some more work to be done from a warm acceptance perspective and our card members realizing that the coverage is there. So, you will see a lot of work in those areas as well.\nOperator: Next, we go to Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Good morning. Thank you, Steve, Jeff and Rosie, I appreciate it. Your competitors have been making some significant acquisitions, Visa acquiring Plaid; MasterCard, several acquisitions; I mean, PayPal buying Honey. American Express has done some interesting tuck-in acquisitions. But first of all, is there any concern about some of the acquisitions from a competitive perspective, like a Visa-Plaid. And is -- Amex, seems like there are so many opportunities to leverage your brand and your network with all of this innovation in the fintech and software space. Is there areas that you would like to leverage or invest more into, whether it's security or other areas?\nSteve Squeri: Look, I mean, we're not getting into obviously specific acquisitions. But, what you've seen our focus over the last sort of 24 months has really been from some of our digital capabilities, whether that be Mezi or Resy or Cake and obviously, LoungeBuddy and we did acompay. And so, what we're trying to do is build out the organic footprint that we have with our existing card members, we're trying to engage with them more digitally. And look, I think that our competitors, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal -- PayPal is really a partner, more than a competitor. When you look at what they're doing, they're doing things that are smart for them. They're run by really smart people, and they've got their strategies. And their main focus is connectivity and bringing more and more different types of transactions across those rails. And I think that the acquisitions that they've done to build out from a network perspective are smart acquisitions for them. When we look at what we're trying to do from a card member and merchant perspective, we feel really comfortable what we've done. And I think, just looking at the Plaid acquisition, which I think is a good acquisition by Visa, it allows them to provide connectivity from their bank partners into fintechs. In fact, we use Plaid today. We have an investment in Plaid. And we'll make a little bit on that as well. And so, that's a more sensible acquisition for them than it would be for us, not only from an economic perspective, but certainly from a strategic perspective, and I think just a customer perspective. So, we look at everything. We have our own target list of things that we want to do and things that quite honestly just don't make sense for us. We're positioned with our model.\nOperator: Next, we go to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: You guys highlighted the -- being with -- between that 8% and 10% revenue growth kind of for a long string of quarters and pretty much right in the middle of that over the course of 2019. As you look into 2020, you talked a little bit -- maybe a little bit of slowdown on the net interest income. Are there any other things that you'd be looking at to accelerate from where they were here?\nJeff Campbell: Well, Moshe, I guess, I -- we look at the stability we've seen overall in revenue growth, 10 quarters of 8 to 10, and see tremendous momentum to continue to meet that same target in 2020. When you look at acceleration, I would actually point you to card fee growth. So, card fee growth has been our fastest growing revenue line and actually accelerated in Q4. And for all the reasons Steve described, we're pretty bullish in our ability to keep that as our fastest growing revenue line. I\u2019d also point out to everyone that of course, you have a large -- because of the way we do the accounting for this, as you would know most, we have a large portion of next year's card fees just sitting on the balance sheet waiting to be amortized. So, we feel really good about that line. And net interest income, I would point out actually has been very steady sequentially, Moshe. Because while our booked loan growth rate has moderated a little bit, part of that is just us being a little bit tighter about things like promotional offers and that's why your yield is going up and net interest income growth has actually been pretty flat. So, gosh, we would look at the 2020 revenue guidance and say, it\u2019s a continuation of what we've been putting up for about two-and-half years. And we feel pretty good about the stability we see in the economy, the stability we see in our credit performance and the tremendous strength, frankly, of the U.S. consumer.\nOperator: Next, we go to a question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Sounds like the guidance ranges are more related to execution than anything else. But, last year, Jeff, you guys have talked about a scenario where there was macroeconomic weakening. To the extent that there was any weakness, how should we think about this guidance, especially on the EPS side? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, look, I think the results we posted, Sanjay, in 2019, demonstrate that we've got a model that produced steady results in the really robust economic environment of 2018 and continued to produce those same results in the more modest growth environment in 2019. So, there is clearly a range of economic outcomes around where we are, where our model is flexible enough or resistant enough to change. I'll go back to the card fee point I just made to Moshe where our card fee growth is actually pretty resilient in different economic environments. So, we feel good about our guidance across any reasonable range of economic outcomes than anyone is forecasting right now. Now, there is a sudden dramatic shift upwards or downwards. That's the kind of thing that it would take to probably cause us to move off that range.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. So, I just wanted to start on the enterprise commercial side. I know it\u2019s still only 9% of billings. But, I think last quarter, we were expecting maybe a little bit of an uptick. We got instead a little bit of a downtick there on a constant currency basis. So, I was just wondering, I know last quarter you had a couple of specific customers that were callouts as driving some of the softness, were those continuing to be headwinds in Q4 and was there more of a malaise in corporate T&E? Do you still think we get back to low-single-digit in our 2020? And then, just on a quick side note, can you size that restructuring charge for us in the quarter? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: So, let me quickly do the facts on the two, and then Steve will probably add a little bit of color. On the large and global, I guess we look at it and we say, sequentially it\u2019s about the same as it was last quarter. Yes, you do have the same two large customers where there is some things unique to those customers going on. But, look, we\u2019ve said for a long time, this isn\u2019t a growth segment for us. This is big companies doing T&E. It's an important part of the franchise. So, we're not frankly particularly overly focused on that rate. We\u2019re focused on other parts of commercial. On the restructuring charge, the point I would make to everyone is, this just an example of what we've done for many, many years, which is we had some very good developments on the tax side. We use that to accelerate some spending around a range of growth initiatives. We see some of that in the marketing line, some of that in some of the other customer engagement lines. And yes, we did take a restructuring charge; it\u2019s a little bit more than $100 million. Look, we've been growing expenses, we've added over 5,000 colleagues in the last year. We will continue to grow expenses in 2020. Frankly, we're going to continue that to add colleagues. But, we got to make sure we have the right people in the right place, so that we can continue as we have for many, many years to scale our Company as we grow our volumes.\nSteve Squeri: And so, as far as restructuring, I think Jeff hit all that. Look, I think with the large and global, it\u2019s -- from a company perspective, not a lot of companies are looking to grow their T&E. So, you don't have sort of the organic growth that you would have. And then, you have a couple of companies that pull back or you have a loss here or there. And you feel that in the numbers. But, it is 9% of the overall billings. But, from a profit perspective, it's a lot less than that. This is an important part of our business from a network perspective, and it allows us to utilize our scale and infrastructure to really support our middle market business and our small business. And so, it plays an important role. And I think where that -- where we are from a perspective of overall billings we're comfortable with. Yes, it\u2019d be great if it would grow. But, if it grows, it's not going to make that much of a difference from a profitability perspective, which gets back to my point about not all billings are created equally. Some billings have a lot more profitability than others. And so, I think you'll probably see this sort of flatness continue as we move in -- as we move into next year. And it's something that we're doing in our own company as well. I mean, we're not looking to grow our T&A expenses. It's not -- I don't sit around my staff and say, let's see how we can grow more T&A. I wouldn't mind sitting around with a lot of my customers\u2019 staffs and saying that. But, we don't do that. And so, I think companies are doing that. They are looking at T&E, looking at some more video conferencing and things like that and reducing some of the travel, and you see that in the numbers.\nOperator: Next, we go to Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Look, given the maturity of the business and it's really impressive to see your U.S. consumer business, which is a third of your business growing at the rate that it is. I'm curious to sort of understand what you think is driving that. Is there an increase in discretionary spending among your legacy customers, or when cite particularly the growth of millennials in the portfolio is the ramp in their spending? \nSteve Squeri: Well, Rick, the interesting thing about our business is, it's probably not mature yet. And I think, one of the reasons after the financial crisis, everybody jumped into this business, especially the banks in a big way, is because this is a business that just continues to grow. When you look at the consumer business in the United States, it's sort 8%, 8%, 8%, 8%, and you see that -- you'll see that continuing. And I think when we look at our business and from maturity perspective, look, it's a mix of new customers, it's a mix of -- or what we would call same store sales, if you\u2019re thinking about this from a retail perspective, it's a mix of organic spending as well. But, we're bringing in new customers to the franchise. And our brand is playing a lot more with millennials, which is over half of our customers that we're acquiring at this particular point in time. And the reach that we're getting with some of our co-brand partners is getting us new customers as well. So, I don't really look at this business as really mature. I look at this business as having a lot -- and I'm not just talking about our business. I'm talking about the card business in general. I think about this as a business that still has a lot of legs and a lot of growth. And you see a lot of the technological changes, whether it's sort of tap and go and making it easy to buy online and so forth. I mean, just with contact list, you're going to see more and more smaller dollar transactions coming on to card products, whether that be vending machines transactions, which is the next thing that's going to happen; you're seeing this with transit; obviously, now in New York City, you can use tap and go through the New York City transit system. So, we don't really look at this as a mature business at all. And we think there is expansion opportunities for us not only with new customers but also with our existing customers, as we have less than half their share of wallet and we have, as we said for a long time, we only have about 23% of their share of lending. So, we think there's still a lot of upside in this business.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: International consumer and international SME continue to be your fastest growth businesses. And particularly, you've called out strength in the UK and the European Continent. Given the regulatory changes with Payment Services Directive 2 in Europe and UK, Visa and MasterCard have both acquired fast ACH trails, both to address PSD2, consumer ACH payments, and also to complement their B2B payment capability. So, my question really is, does fast ACH need to play a role in American Express' future? And if so, where would you have an interest geographically, potentially to acquire fast ACH rails?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, couple of things. Number one, I think from a consumer perspective, we see this sort of fast payments, we see as really looking to cannibalize some debit, looking to cannibalize some ACH, some check in and things like that. So, from a consumer perspective -- and we have an open banking test right now from a consumer perspective ourselves, where we're offering some of our non-customers the ability to pay out of their bank account. So, that could be an opportunity for us. But, I don't see that really impacting credit and charge growth. Look, I think, what's interesting for fast payments ACH from a B2B perspective, and I've said this multiple times on calls like this and in meetings, it will play a role in B2B payments and it will play a role in procurement spending as well. The reality is that we believe we can achieve the same things with the network that we have today and the connectivity that we have as we are -- we have the flexibility in pricing. Look, I don't -- I'm not constrained by interchange. I could price from a transaction perspective. And one of the advantages we do have in Europe in particular is we\u2019re a three-party and not a four-party system. And so, the relationships that we have with card members and merchants, which with that direct connectivity, we believe we can accomplish the same things without acquiring either a Vocalink or an Earthport or something like that. But, make no mistake, it will play a role in procurement. The other thing that I've said on these calls before is from a procurement perspective, fast ACH is really not sort of the be all, end all, given that most of these payments occur in 60 to 90 days. The bigger opportunity is really integrating the payment process within the procurement process and marrying the procure to pay. And so -- and that takes a long, long time. And that's why you do partnerships with people like SAP and people like Ariba to try and integrate the payment in. Companies are much -- look from my perspective, having our own procurement here as well, companies are much more focused on how you merge the two than sort of paying a vendor in 20 minutes. The last thing I want to do is really pay a vendor in 20 minutes. But what I really want to do is integrate the two together. So, I think there's a place for these acquisitions for -- again for reason Visa MasterCard, it goes back I think, a little bit to Plaid acquisition. But, I think we can accomplish the same thing with the capabilities that we have at the current moment.\nOperator: Next, we go to James Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJames Friedman: So, Steve, I did -- and follow-up to the previous question and the previous before that. I did want to ask about the large and global corporate again. And I know it's a little like playing twister. But I'm looking at the appendix in terms of the volumes from T&E, and the T&E actually grew 6%. So, that seems pretty good and consistent with the way that it's been. But, I realized not all T&Es lands in large and corporate. I assume some of that's in -- so anyway, any context about how to the T&E could grow but the large and global was down?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. Well, T&E -- think about our consumer travel business and think about -- just think about the expansion that we've had in small business international and the expansion that we've had in consumer international. And when you think about small business international, it's not as mature as small businesses in the United States. And so, if you go back in history, what happened from a small business perspective in the United States, that started as a T&E card and now has morphed much more into a B2B card, and so the mix of volume that we have. And the reality is, when you think about sort of the T&E aspects as it relates outside the U.S., small business international that we have, there's a higher percentage of T&E that occurs on that card. So, that's the first thing that small businesses will put on internationally. And then, obviously, our consumer business is growing in leaps and bounds internationally. And again, that has a much more T&E focus than it does retail focus.\nJeff Campbell: The only math point I would add is, in our tables that stat is the U.S. stat but it just goes to the point that the large and global segment is a small part of our total billing. So, the T&E trends get dwarfed in terms of the global company by what consumers and small business are doing.\nOperator: Next we go to a question from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Steve, I want to ask kind of a longer term history question about your card fee strategy. Because when you go back a few years, there really wasn't that much growth or low single digit growth in card fees. And I'm wondering if your view is -- what's changed more Amex\u2019s approach or more of the consumer appetite for fee-based cards?\nSteve Squeri: No, it's been our approach that has changed, which is why if you go back to the last couple of years, we have started to refresh products. We were not in the business of refreshing products. If you do not refresh the product, it is really hard to increase the fee. Adding value enables you to increase the fee. If you're not adding value, you can't do that. We had a fundamental shift in sort of how we've approached the business over the last few years. You've seen a lot more focus on coverage; you've seen a lot more focus on -- you've seen a lot more focus on a focused international strategy, and you've also seen a major focus on card refreshment. And card refreshment, remember is -- it's not just about fees, it's to get people to spend, which then gets people to revolve that spend. So, it really is more about engagement. And the fees come along as you add value.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to get a little clarity on your thoughts for billed business growth trends in 2020. With comps getting easier and we're starting to lap some of the issues in corporate and certainly GNS, could we see an inflection point in 2020 where billed business growth starts to reaccelerate? And just a housekeeping item. Are there going to be any unique quarterly trends in marketing spend this year due to the 2020 Olympics? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think the short answer on the second one, Craig, is no. Obviously, the Olympics is an important event from a lot of perspectives, and we have a fabulous franchise in Japan. And it's benefiting from the Prime Minister's incentives that he's providing in the country to encourage more card use, all good stuff for us, but, but not big enough for you to see in our global results. On the inflection point on billed business, I\u2019d really go back Craig to the theme Steve and I both talked a lot about over the last hour, which is our revenue momentum has been very stable for 10 quarters. And that's because of the breath of sources, it\u2019s because of the way we're focused on being thoughtful about things like card fees, which Steve just touched on, or how we're pricing for risk in our lending portfolio. And so, we feel good about the trends on billed business, but we -- but more importantly, we're focused on the trends and stability on revenue that make us very comfortable with the guidance we've provided for another year of 8% to 10% revenue growth. And it is not counting on a big inflection upwards on billed business. If that happens, great, but that is not a planning assumption, if you will, that underlies the guidance we\u2019ve provided.\nRosie Perez: With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve.

With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks Rosie. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our release earlier today, our third quarter results are a continuation of the consistent steady performance we've been delivering over the last few years. We had strong FX-adjusted revenue growth of 9% in the quarter and our EPS of $2.08 was 11% higher than last year. Consistently high levels of revenue growth we are delivering is the result of the focused approach we've taken in executing our strategy and the strength of our differentiated business model. This was the 9th straight quarter where FX-adjusted revenue growth was 8% or higher. I'm especially pleased that our revenue growth continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of spend, loans, and fees. Card fee revenues were particularly strong, growing 19% and exceeding $1 billion this quarter for the first time. Nearly 70% of the cards we've acquired this year are fee-based products, providing us recurring subscription-like revenues. The trends we saw in the business remain consistent with an economy that continues to expand, albeit at a more modest pace than last year. Our FX-adjusted proprietary billings grew 7%, led by strong growth in our U.S. and international consumer businesses. We continue to deliver healthy loan growth, and our credit performance remained at industry-leading levels. In fact, better than the expectations we had at the beginning of the year. So, as you can see, even with some uncertainty in the global economic and political environment, our strategy of investing in share, scale, and relevance is enabling us to deliver steady solid results. With that in mind, I'd like to discuss our progress on the three company-wide initiatives I laid out at Investor Day. As a reminder, these cut across all of our strategic imperatives. They are focusing on our customer as a platform for growth, expanding and leveraging our network of strategic partners, and prioritizing our investments in international to drive growth. Let's start with customers as a platform for growth. Our global diverse customer base has become a major source of growth for us. One of the ways we're deepening relationships with existing customers is through the disciplined strategic approach we've taken to continuously refresh our products. These refreshes are not just cosmetic changes. We're redefining membership by adding innovative, experiential, and rational value that our customers respond well to, and we're pricing for that additional value. In the third quarter, we continued the refresh of our Platinum Card portfolio across several international markets, and we're following a similar playbook with our Gold Cards. Now, we're updating our iconic Green Card. A few weeks ago, we introduced a new Ocean Plastic design; and later this month, we'll announce an array of changes to the product, including new benefits, broader payment flexibility, and a digital focus. And just yesterday, we announced the major refresh of our Corporate Card program, which includes a number of new features, including newer enhanced benefits with Uber, Hilton, and CLEAR, which is the biometric identification system that expedites the airport security process. As part of that announcement, we introduced an extension of our Corporate Card program designed to meet the needs of start-ups with features that include corporate liability and dynamic spending capacity. As I've said on prior occasions, we typically see a significant increase in spending, when our customers add an additional Amex product to their wallets, and our Corporate Card members represent a great opportunity here. For many of our customers, the Corporate Card is their first American Express product. To encourage them to add a personal card, we're creating ways that provide benefits for carrying both, such as a new program that offers an incentive for Corporate Card members to obtain one of our select consumer cards. These initiatives are proving to be a terrific platform for growth. We're seeing a lift in spending and engagement on our refreshed products. Over 60% of our total loan growth is coming from existing card members, and we're earning a steady stream of revenues as more customers move to fee-based products, which are priced to the additional value we're delivering. Our customers have also become one of the best and most efficient ways to bring new card members into the franchise. Through our Member-Get-Member referral program, we've acquired over 250,000 new customers this year so far. In addition, successful referrals have increased 35% compared to last year's third quarter. Turning to partnerships. The third quarter continued to demonstrate the benefits of our powerful network of partners who help us deliver enhanced value across the enterprise. As I've said before, partnerships are essential to each of our strategic imperatives, and they take many forms from the over 50 co-brand relationships we have around the world to our recent digital partnerships to expanding our merchant network. When we talk about partnerships, we have to start with Delta, our largest, deepest, and longest-running relationship. At the end of September, we announced seven refreshed Delta SkyMiles co-brand cards as part of our renewed 11-year agreement with the airline. The new cards, which will be available in January in the U.S., will feature a range of customized travel benefits for both consumers and small business card members. Also in the third quarter, we launched a new small business credit card in the U.K. with British Airways and one in Singapore with Singapore Airlines, and we announced refreshed consumer cards in Canada with AIR MILES and Scotiabank. In addition to co-brands, we've been expanding our digital partnerships. Earlier this week, we announced two new offerings with PayPal and Venmo for U.S. consumer card members. First is the ability to pay for purchases made through PayPal with membership rewards points. And we're also introducing with the bill functionality within the Amex mobile app. On the merchant side, with the help of our OptBlue partnerships, we remain on track to achieve virtual parity coverage in the U.S. by the end of the year. In international, our strategy of selectively increasing our investments to drive share, scale, and relevance through a country-by-country approach is delivering strong results. Despite political and economic uncertainty in some regions, international remains the highest growth area of our business. Third quarter results showed continued strong growth across both consumer and small business segments, driven by results in our top strategic countries where we've allocated incremental investments. Since the beginning of the year, we've launched 18 new or refreshed proprietary cards, three co-brand cards, and 30 network cards across international. As a result, we're taking share and generating strong billings growth in most of our proprietary countries, with overall FX-adjusted Consumer Proprietary Billings, up 14% in the quarter, and FX-adjusted SME billings up 18%. And finally, we're making good progress on expanding merchant coverage, which is key to our overall international growth strategy. As you can see, we've made a lot of progress in each of our three priority areas since March and there's more to come. In summary, I feel very good about our performance in the quarter and year-to-date. As we look ahead, I expect the consistent trends we've seen to continue into Q4, translating into revenue growth of 8% to 10% in the quarter and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of adjusted EPS between $7.85 and $8.35. Our performance reinforces my confidence in our ability in today's environment to sustain high levels of revenue growth and consistent double-digit EPS growth, which creates value for our shareholders. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about yet another solid quarter of steady and consistent performance. Let's get right to our summary financials on Slide 3. Third quarter revenues of $11 billion, grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, with this growth driven again by a well-balanced mix of spend, lend and fee revenues. We continue to see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and FX-adjusted revenue growth of 9%. Although the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, the spread between our reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth has lessened slightly relative to Q2. As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar began in the third quarter of last year. Assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX-adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the fourth quarter 2019. Our strong topline revenue performance drove net income of $1.8 billion, up 6% from a year ago, and earnings per share was $2.08, representing EPS growth of 11% in the third quarter. This EPS growth was supported by the 4% reduction in our share count enabled by our continued prudent management of the capital generating capabilities of our business model as we returned $5.5 billion in excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last four quarters. Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, our FX-adjusted total billings growth for the third quarter was 6%. We think it is important, though, to continue to breakout the billings growth between our proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we exit our network business in Europe and Australia. We expect to fully lap the billings impact from these exits in 2020. Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings, which comes from our network business, GNS was down 2% in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Turning to our proprietary billed business growth on Slide 5. The trends this quarter continue to be consistent with the economic tone. The U.S. consumer continues to show solid growth with even some modest acceleration as we have gone through 2019. The international consumer shows even higher levels of growth and our commercial customers are lapping a particularly strong 2018 with spending trends that have diverged a bit from the consumer segment. You see this as you turn to Slide 6. We first spoke last quarter about potential signs of caution in commercial spending trends relative to the strong and steady growth we see in consumer. Over the last few months, the headlines and macro data, which suggests that these trends continue, particularly among the larger corporations within our customer base. We see these dynamics in our large and global corporate card trends, where we had a 1% decline in billed business on an FX-adjusted basis in the third quarter. So, adjusting for the reduction in spending from just two large customers, where we saw some client-specific decreases, the growth rate would have been a bit above 1% this quarter. In contrast, spending from our U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs grew a solid 6% in the third quarter with importantly relatively stable growth throughout the three months of the quarter. We continue to feel great about the long-term opportunities with both of these customer types. And as Steve highlighted a few minutes ago, we are making investments that leverage our strong leadership position and differentiated business model to take advantage of these opportunities. International SME remains our highest growing customer type with 18% FX-adjusted billings growth in the third quarter. Given our focus on this segment and the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products, we believe we have a long runway to sustain this strong growth. Moving to U.S. consumer, which made up 33% of the company's billings in the third quarter, billings were up 8%. And taking the number out of decimal, actually a bit stronger than Q1 and Q2. This growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers. These trends also highlight the continued strength of the consumer in the U.S. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the teens at 14% on an FX-adjusted basis. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key markets, despite the mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While growth in Australia and Mexico moderated to the high-single digits this quarter, we continued to see strong growth of 19% in both the U.K. and Japan as well as double-digit growth in our top markets across the EU, all on an FX-adjusted basis. Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia, where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 3% on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall then, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. Total loan growth was 9% in the third quarter, with over 60% of that growth again coming from our existing customers. We feel good about our lending strategy, which is focused on taking advantage of the unique opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customers borrowing. We believe we have a long runway to continue this strategy. Moving to the right-hand side of Slide 7. Net interest yield was 11.1% in the third quarter, up 30 basis points relative to the prior year, reflecting continued positive impacts from mix and pricing for risk. We remain focused on optimizing our lending capabilities and pricing constructs, and we have seen lower loan balances on promotional offers, as we have shifted towards more premium products. The combination of loan growth and yield increases are contributing to the 12% growth in net interest income that we delivered this quarter. Slide 8 then shows the credit implications of our strategy. As you can see, the trends on both write-off rates and delinquencies continued to be stable and benign, reflecting in part the low unemployment rate in relatively stable economy. We see these trends across both our consumer and commercial segments. The GCP net loss ratio remains lower than last year. And as you've seen in the tables that accompany our earnings release, both consumer and small business credit trends also remained steady. These trends lead to the same conclusion we have reached in each quarter so far this year. We do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing much better than we expected at the beginning of the year. This brings us to provision expense. In the third quarter, provision expense growth was 8%, reflecting the greater stability in our credit trends that began in the second half of 2018. Clearly, as we've gone through the year, credit performance for us as well as for others in the industry has been better than expected. That's what we saw again in the third quarter and as a result, we now expect full-year provision growth of around 10%. While we are on the subject of provision though, let me take a few minutes to talk about CECL. We are making good progress on our efforts to prepare for implementation on January 1, 2020. We stick with our comments last quarter, based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL today, our current total reserves of $2.8 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve, given the extremely short life of a charge receivable. Stepping back, there are three important takeaways on CECL that I would like to leave you with. First, we believe that the capital impact of the one-time implementation increase in reserves will likely be very manageable, given our strong balance sheet, 30% plus ROE and spend-centric model. Next, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. Although the ultimate impact will be heavily dependent on many factors, we will likely have higher provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology, as we continue to grow our loan book. Since we are currently finalizing our CECL models and working on our 2020 plan, we'll provide more color on the expected 2020 impact from CECL on next quarter's call. Finally, CECL is merely an accounting-driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk profile, or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios. Given this as well as our strategy of investing for growth, we do not intend to change our investment plans because of the impact CECL will have on provision expense growth in 2020. Now, let's get back to our results and turn to the strong revenue growth of 9% on an FX-adjusted basis that you see on Slide 10. The consistent execution of our strategies and our focus on investing in share, scale and relevance has driven topline revenue growth of 8% or more for over two years. This consistent revenue performance has occurred in both the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019. And despite the modest sequential deceleration in volume growth we saw this quarter, our revenue growth of 9.4% in the third quarter was relatively flat to the 9.6% growth we delivered last quarter. This revenue growth was again driven by broad-based growth across spend, lend and fee revenues as you can see on Slide 11. And importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from spend and fee revenues remained at 80% in the third quarter, in line with those both recent history and a much longer view of our history. Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fee growth accelerated to 19% and as Steve said surpassed $1 billion in the third quarter for the first time. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment and our unique value propositions that Steve also talked about in his opening remarks. We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when they choose to pay these subscription-like fees. And as Steve mentioned earlier, but I think it bears repeating, we continue to see that the majority of our new card members, around 70% so far this year, are choosing our fee-based products as well. Going forward, we feel good about our ability to maintain strong growth in these membership revenues, given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum across geographies and across customer segments. Net interest income grew 12% in the third quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I just mentioned a few moments ago. So let's come back now to the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue, on Slide 12. On the right, you see the discount revenue grew 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with the last two quarters, making this the eighth consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue, not the average discount rate, is working. Moving on now to the things we are investing in to drive our strong revenue growth. Let's start with our customer engagement costs, which you can see on Slide 13, were $5 billion in the third quarter, up 11% versus last year. Starting at the bottom, marketing and business development costs were up 11% in the third quarter and were in line with Q2. Remember that this line has two components, our traditional marketing and promotion expenses and then payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Also remember that this is the second quarter, where we are seeing the impact of our renewed agreement with Delta, which increased our marketing and business development costs by $200 million relative to our original outlook for the full year. Continuing on to rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year, a bit higher than our billing trends, given our evolving value propositions. Moving then to the top of the slide, Card Member services costs were up 22% in the third quarter. We continue to expect this line to be our fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value propositions such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products. Moving on then to operating expenses on Slide 14. We saw a 5% increase in the third quarter, consistent with a long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. I would offer two comments here. First, as I mentioned last quarter, some of the investments we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth, growth in sales force, premium servicing, digital capabilities, these will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years. Second, as a reminder, through our Amex Ventures group, we have a strategic investment portfolio of over 40 investments. This quarter's OpEx included a net benefit of roughly $0.05 related to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our strategic investment portfolio, which is somewhat higher than the benefit we saw last year. Altogether, I would just sum up by saying that we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to grow our operating expenses more slowly than our revenues. Turning to capital on Slide 15. Our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11%, at the top end of our 10% to 11% target range and we returned $1.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we've said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plan. We've historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength, while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders and we will continue with that philosophy going forward. So that brings us to our outlook, and then we'll open the call for your questions. With each quarter of this year, we've demonstrated consistent progress against our objectives of delivering high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. Now looking ahead, given today's economic environment, we see a long runway to sustain this performance. In the near term, to give you a bit more color on the fourth quarter, we expect revenue growth to continue with the strong levels we have seen and to be within our 8% to 10% guidance range for the quarter. And if FX rates stay where they are, the headwind from the strong dollar should lessen in the fourth quarter. We expect the stability we have seen in our credit trends to continue; the full-year provision growth of around 10%. And given the consistent operating performance trends we have seen throughout the first three quarters of the year, we expect our Q4 EPS results will be very much in line with our year-to-date results, excluding the $0.05 mark-to-market benefit our investment portfolio that we saw in the third quarter and of course, any other contingencies that may occur in the fourth quarter, which would bring us to reaffirm our adjusted earnings guidance of $7.85 to $8.35 for the full year. In addition, we are working towards having a 2020 plan showing high revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth off of the middle part of our 2019 EPS guidance range. Of course, this assumes we do not see a material deterioration in the economic environment versus where we are today and given my earlier comments around CECL, it does not factor in any potential impacts from CECL in 2020. To close, our year-to-date performance and expectations for the full year demonstrate consistent execution against our strategies as well as the financial growth algorithm I shared with you at our last Investor Day. We remain focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today's environment double-digit EPS growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rosie.\nRosie Perez: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I'll ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the lines for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please.\nCraig Maurer: I have a question on net card fees that basically what I'm trying to get as you showed some acceleration in net card fee growth, cards in the U.S., basic cards-in-force has been largely range-bound throughout the year. So, can net card fees continue to accelerate if cards remain somewhat flattish and should card growth in the U.S. accelerate again or how should we think about that?\nJeffrey Campbell: Craig, as you recall, we tend to discourage people a little bit from looking at that gross cards-in-force number because what's really important here is the quality of the cards you have and the quality of the cards you're bringing in. Both Steve and I talked about the fact that 70% of the new card members we're bringing in are on fee-based products. We've talked for a couple of quarters now about bringing in generally more premium oriented mix of card members and that cards-in-force number is also influenced by our periodic efforts, frankly, to go back and cancel some inactive card members. So, we feel tremendously strong about the breadth of the products that are driving card fee growth and I think there is a long runway to continue.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. And I think just to add one other point, I think the other thing that's really important is the recent strategy of consistently refreshing our products is critically important to not only growing card fees, but it's also what we've seen is we see an uptick in spending even from existing cardholders. So again, I think the number is a little bit deceptive, because you've got a clean out and you also have a switch, you've got a lot of upgrades in there as well. So we feel really confident about the strategy we're on.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Bob Napoli from William Blair. Go ahead, please.\nBob Napoli: A question on your B2B payment strategy. You acquired ACOM Pay during the quarter, and it does automated AP. You have a lot of different partnerships there and so it's an area that massive market TAM, it could move the needle I would think for American Express. Can you update your thoughts on your investments in the B2B payment space in AP and AR automation and if that can move the needle materially for Amex over the long term?\nStephen Squeri: Yes, I think, look, Bob, I think as we've said, and we said this at Investor Day as well, our belief is this is a long-term opportunity. Having said that, we are - we've entered into partnerships with people like bill.com at the real small end of the market. We've done MineralTree and WEX in sort of mid-space, we've done Tradeshift, we've done Ariba. We have now an investment in ACOM to help sort of automate those processes. But one thing I will point out is, while it is a long-term play, most of our spending in an SME segment today is B2B spending and that continues to grow. So we feel really confident about what we're doing, but as I've said before, the integration into the procurement process, it's a tough integration and it takes time and that's why we do these partnerships, that's why we make these investments and that's why we still believe it's a long-term play. But we are seeing value just from a B2B perspective, especially in SME, where the majority of our spending is B2B, not C&E.\nOperator: Our next question, we'll go to the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\nRick Shane: Just want to sort of delve into the divergence between acceleration of billed business on an account basis at the consumer level and a deceleration on the commercial business. Historically, has that provided any signal that we should be paying attention to?\nStephen Squeri: No, not necessarily. I think if you look at the last recession, you would have seen sort of the reverse, you would have seen consumer coming down first and then commercial. So, I don't think that is a signal at all. As Jeff pointed out, our consumer business has grown slightly in the U.S. quarter-over-quarter, really strong across all segments as it relates to international, whether it's SME or whether it's consumer, mid-teen double-digit growth. Let me comment on where you may be seeing some softness as we look at the numbers. You've seen a 1% decline as it relates to global. A couple of adjustments in there with maybe some jet fuel or things like that, but you also have to realize, we're coming off a high. It was almost 10% growth in the third quarter of last year. So, to me that's almost stable and when I think about large and global, I haven't been involved with this for real long time, I'm pretty comfortable about that. When you look at our SME in the U.S. and we're about 6% up year-over-year, again, off of a double-digit high. You got to delve into it and when we look at it, we look at sort of three components of that billing. We look at are we continuing to acquire and that has been steady for us, are we losing accounts either from a competitive perspective or from the perspective of losses account to just go out of business and that has been steady, where we're seeing sort of a softening a little bit is in the organic spend. If you think about it from a retail perspective, you would think of same-store sales. But even that, again, we came off a high in the third quarter of last year, and that's still a positive trend.  So, what would concern me is if that same account spending had gone down, it is not, it is still in positive territory, albeit, not in the same sort of significant growth that we saw. And to be honest, that was growth that we had not seen before. So, the sustainability of that was questionable on our minds anyway. And so, we feel pretty good about it. And again, as Jeff mentioned, the credit quality, credit quality is still pristine.\nOperator: We'll next go to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead, please.\nBill Carcache: I had a follow-up question on your fee-based products. Some innovative fintech players like Square are enjoying some success in targeting the unbanked and underbanked customer segment, for example, with their Cash App and goal of getting customers to use it as their primary bank account through direct deposit. You guys were well ahead of this trend years ago when you identified an opportunity to generate fee-based income in the segment with products like Bluebird and Serve. Can you give us some general color on how you guys are thinking about those products today? Do you still see the growth opportunity there as attractive? How focused are you on growing those products as continued innovation and enhancement of the underlying app, something that you guys are investing in? And just in general, are you seeing some customers use Bluebird and Serve for direct deposit? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: We're not focused on it at all. In fact, we sold that last year to InComm. That's not a segment that we see as an opportunity for us. We took a run at it and the theory of the case was that you would be able to upgrade those customers into our product - into our traditional product set. The reality is that was a bridge too far to cross. And so we sold off that portfolio of Bluebird, [indiscernible] and Gift Cards to InComm last year. And I think InComm's really happy with that transaction, and we are really happy with that transaction. We do not see that as a growth opportunity for us at all.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Recognizing that credit, no sign of deterioration, in fact, actually is probably improved over the course of the year. Any sense as to how to think about just the impact of CECL on ongoing provisions relative to that kind of 50-ish percent increase on the credit piece as we think about the growth of provisions into next year?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, obviously, Moshe. That's a very fair question that we're still not ready to quantify. I do think the range we've given for the one-time impact, you can sort of do some back of the envelope math off of that, but there are so many complex pieces to CECL. Obviously, CECL will also require us to incorporate into our accounting provision forward-looking economic forecast amongst the over 100 other variables that will be part of the 150-plus customer segments and models that drive this. So directionally, I am very comfortable saying there is some - given our levels of growth, some higher provision expense you would expect in a normal economic environment under CECL. I'm just not ready to give an exact number. I really want to emphasize though what I said in my earlier remarks, which are that from our perspective, this is pure accounting-driven acceleration of losses that ultimately would have run through our financial statements anyway. It has zero impact on real economics. It has zero impact on our view of risk and that is why as we think about 2020, we think we are going to make a series of decisions about what we're willing and what we think is prudent to invest in continuing to drive the business for the long term, and then we'll let the CECL changes to the region fall where they will.\nOperator: We'll go now to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\nBetsy Graseck: So I just wanted to dig in a little bit, Steve, to the comment that you were making earlier around the opportunity to penetrate your corporate card customers with personal card. And the reason I ask the question is, I would have thought this was something that was well done and already was maxed out but your comments suggest it's not. So I wanted to understand is this - is the go-to-market strategy different and what kind of opportunity set you could get? And then, Jeff, if you could just reiterate the mark-to-market benefit that you had and where we're supposed to strip that out? I'm getting a couple of questions in on exactly where we're supposed to strip that $0.05 out of. Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. The reality is we really have not focused on penetrating our corporate card base with our personal cards for pretty much forever. We did some test last year. Part of it was a reluctance in our - with our corporate card customers for us to access the base, but the tide has changed. The tide has changed, we've had companies come to us and ask us as they look to bring more value to their employees, can we do that. And so, this is a welcome opportunity for us. So I would say it is absolutely new territory for us. So it's not been maxed out at all. Let's not to say that our corporate card holders do not have personal cards, but it is to say that we never utilized our corporate card distribution opportunities within the corporate card - companies that have our corporate card. So we're excited about the opportunity and think that it's going to provide another opportunity to lift our overall cards.\nJeffrey Campbell: On the mark-to-market, Betsy, I'll make two points. Just to remind everyone beginning last January, we and all companies began to have to mark-to-market various investments for us that really means the 40 or so investments we have through our Amex Ventures Fund. In general those margins have not been material. This quarter they were a little bit more materially it netted to about $0.05 positive. We see that as an ongoing part of our business. My only reference to the $0.05 in terms of, to use your phrase Betsy not mine stripping out. Was that when I talked about Q4, I made the observation that we feel really good about the \u2013 consistent operating performance of the company. And we expect Q4 to look very similar to the first three quarters. So as you think about the pure operating performance of the company in the first three quarters. In Q1, I take the merchant litigation charge out. So that puts you $2 a share. In Q2 it's $2.07 a share and again going back to this operating performance concept in Q3 that takes you to the about $2.03 level. So that's the only context in which I was trying to bring up the $0.05. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: We will move on to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: I don't imagine you've gotten this question in a while just given how strong your revenue growth has been and it sounds like you're pretty confident. And the outlook for 2020 as well around revenue growth, but I have been getting some questions from investors asking how much room you guys have to control and further growth of OpEx should revenue growth. So Steve, I guess is the guy who is responsible for getting those OpEx under control when revenue is weak and mentioned here in your comments \u2013 on thoughts there?\nStephen Squeri: Yes I mean, look I think if you look at sort of how we've controlled OpEx over the last eight years. I think it was an aggregate growth probably about 6% or so. As we look at it as we've sort of changed philosophy a little bit to look at, high revenue growth. It made sense to not walk away from some of these OpEx opportunities that we had. As Jeff said, I don't think this is a consistent playbook that we're going to run, but I have all the confidence in the world in our ability to control to control OpEx. We're still providing operating leverage when you think about sort of nine to five here, which is what we've done. The problem is when you're growing revenue at four and you're growing revenue of five if you want that leverage, you got to grow OpEx at about one. So the Delta is really \u2013 relatively similar to what we've been doing. And we're looking good investment opportunities, but you're right. I was known as the OpEx guy here for \u2013 a lot of years and still am. I still drive people crazy about it. And I will continue to do that, but we're not going to make any foolish decisions. And I believe that we still have operating leverage opportunities as it relates to OpEx and revenue.\nOperator: We have a question from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead.\nStephen Squeri: David, you there.\nJeffrey Campbell: David?\nOperator: Please check your mute feature on your phone.\nStephen Squeri: All right.\nOperator: We will move on to the line of Chris Donat with Sandler & O'Neill.\nChris Donat: I had a question about marketing spend \u2013 as I think about this year and even last year you had some elevated marketing spend with the brand refresh in 2018 that's built into 2019. And then you had the Delta agreement, which also led to the 200 million of elevated spending. And then you got all these product refreshes. I'm just wondering as we think about 2020 do you come up against some easier comps on spending or are there things in the pipeline that will likely absorb marketing spend in 2020. Just think about how to compare 2020 to 2019?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes in many ways Chris, I think the examples you cite are wonderful illustration of why a few years ago. We began to encourage people to focus on broadly what we call our customer engagement costs, right. Because we pull different levers at different times in the rewards category or to your point, in the traditional marketing category around brand spending or and spending we do in the payments department partner area with Delta. And at other times we use to put resources into Card Member services. So the trends in anyone of those lines may vary a little bit from year-to-year or from quarter-to-quarter. The broad group of all of them however, is what we're using to drive high levels of revenue growth. And we've been very consistent for some years now Chris. In saying, we do expect that collectively those costs are going to grow a little bit faster than revenue. But that's what's going to enable us to drive in today's environment 8% to 10% revenue growth. It's why the OpEx leverage Steve just talked about is so important to help mitigate that margin compression, you get from customer engagement because OpEx to grow more slowly than our revenues. You combine that with our strong balance sheet and that's how we have a model that is consistently producing double-digit EPS.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of [Dominic Gabriel] with Oppenheimer. Go ahead please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. Look, the diversity of the revenue growth is really strong. For sure, and I think one thing that is taking some investors by surprise is not only the fee for card or the NIM expanding this quarter. But to some extent, but really the discount rate has been on quite a nice trajectory. And I know that you talked about not managing to the discount rate. But your strategy has shown at least over the last number of quarters that the discount rate is moving up as well and that's a nice benefit as well. Can you just talk about what you've lapped and what's going into the discount rate expanding just as a natural piece of the puzzle here? Thanks so much.\nStephen Squeri: Yes and as you know and I always say this, I really don't focus on the discount rate all that much. Yes it's been, it's been consistent. It's a little bit up, but I think you've got a couple of things going on. I mean you've got there some strategic and renegotiations that we lapped there was activity in Europe. There was activity in Australia, in any given quarter, there is a mix of business and so all those things contribute. What I really focused in on is that consistent discount revenue growth. And if you want to project this out \u2013 reality is, is that as you expand into B2B, you're not going to have the same kind of discount rate in B2B. But again there, what I'd like to focus on is what the margin is right and so, if you look at a lower discount rate. You\u2019ll also look at lower rewards cost and things like that. And so, ultimately what we really focused in is the margin between the discount rate and the costs that go along with those billings. But we're really pleased with the way discount revenue has gone. And when all the numbers come in the discount rate is \u2013 it\u2019s flattish to up and that's okay, too.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna for your question. Go ahead please.\nJames Friedman: I just wanted to ask Jeff with regard to the GNS Slide 6 up 3% adjusted. I think you made \u2013 in your prepared remarks you said that we were lapping that in 2020. It might be, this might be over meaning like the tough compares. Is 3% what we should be thinking about as kind of the new norm when we contact business?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, so couple of questions or couple of comments James first. Remember in many ways the most important aspect of our GNS network these days is driving coverage in 170 or so countries around the globe. And we rely on a network of great partners to do that for us in many countries and that's priority one. Second thing is that not all GNS billings at the same. In general, as you know, the financial contribution from GNS itself is more modest than its billing contribution. That contribution also varies a lot from country-to-country and we have a few large countries to drive a whole lot of billings, much more modest economics and those billings can be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarter. So I don't \u2013 I wouldn't take the 3% as a mark of what you will consistently see once we finish lapping, Europe and Australia. I think you'll see it probably trend back up a little bit from there. But the most important thing to keep in mind is the GNS network around the globe is really about coverage.\nOperator: We have a question in queue from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nJason Kupferberg: And Jeff just wanted to put a finer point on your EPS math there, because I know you didn't formally narrow the full year EPS range. But it sounds like you're pointing us to around two or three or so for Q4, which I think would get us to around 819 or so for the full year. So I just wanted to clarify that. And then do you think that we've troughed in terms of large enterprise volume growth, just the down one this quarter. I know there were some moving parts there but...\nJeffrey Campbell: Let me make a few comments on guidance, maybe including philosophy, Jason. And Steve, you can comment on the large and global customers. Look our philosophy, which we have tried to be true to this year as we come out at the beginning of the year and we tell you here is our expectation for the full year and we give you some color around that. And then our expectation is, as we report our results each quarter we're going to tell you if something is happened so dramatically that it takes us out of that original range. But beyond that, we're just going to give you some color about how things are going. We also really want to emphasize that we are running the company for the long term. We're certainly not running it to produce quarter-by-quarter results, but we will be true to our annual kinds of earnings commitments. So, that's just I think important background. As to the specific math, look, I think, Jason, due to your math, I'm not going to confirm or not confirm your specific math, but I think I was trying to be very clear that our operating performance has been really consistent across the first three quarters. You can measure that at $2 a share, $2.07 a share, probably two or three for this quarter and we expect the fourth quarter to look, something like that.\nStephen Squeri: As far as global and large accounts, global and large accounts in 2018 had a really terrific, terrific year. And so going into this year, our expectations weren't the same expectations as they were last year. As we think about sort of planning forward, I would think about sort of the 0% range for the fourth quarter for global and large accounts. And then I think it gets back to historical levels for us, which is anywhere between 1% and 4%. I think it's just because a lot of that is T&E. As we start to penetrate more into the B2B space, then I think you'll see that go up, but as I've said, traditionally I met with CFOs and so forth they are not driving to move their T&E spend up what you're looking for us to do is actually to help them manage their T&E spend down. And so it's a very interesting business in that our value proposition is, we help you manage your cost down. And we do that through benchmarking. We do that through helping them negotiate and we do that by providing insights and so it's an interesting business where the retained count - to retain accounts you actually help them shrink a little bit. And so, then you need to go get some more account. So we're very comfortable with sort of the traditional levels, I think what you saw last year was just people getting out a lot more including ourselves actually and just spending a little bit more on T&E, but I think it's fair to think about this in sort of the 0% to 3% range going forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.\nDon Fandetti: So I wanted to dig in a little bit on the small business, year-over-year spend growth rate, I mean, there's a couple of factors, obviously, you've got potentially like weaker or more caution on the core business front. But I assume you're still getting that secular penetration, I want to know if that's still happening at the same rate. And then also your position in small business is remarkably higher than your peers. Is there any change in competition, are you holding share or is this all just sort of normal caution and tougher comps. And then lastly around that same thing, when does B2B kick in as the small businesses automated accounts payable accounts receivable. I think you had said you get a 42% uplift in spend as that happens. I mean is it just so early in that process. What we see in 2020, 2021? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. So, Don. The last question first, I think it's still early in the process. You know, automating, automating that spend and what you do with someone like ACOM or what you do with some of the other providers, these are interfaces to whatever sort of accounts receivable procurement systems that they have and it's not always their priority to do that. So that takes a little bit of time. So you'll see a little bit uptick in 2020, 2021, so forth and so on. Look, I think that - let's just talk about sort of secular penetration. I think we are still acquiring counts and we don't look at so much of accounts as we look at acquired bill business. We're acquiring billed business at pretty much the same rate we've been acquiring it. As I mentioned before, we're not losing accounts at any higher level or lower level than we've had probably for the last eight quarters. We're pretty consistent on that. As far as our overall position in the market, I think it's really, really consistent and hasn't really changed. I think I'll point you back to what I said before, I think the downturn that we've seen in our growth rate here is really around what we would call organic. And not that it's not growing, it's just not growing fast enough or is not growing at the same rate it did last year when it had a lot of momentum, especially from the Tax Act. Having said all that, there is more competition in this space, than we've seen in a long, long time because much like banks found after sort of the great recession that the consumer credit card business was an attractive area banks have now found that this area is attractive as well. Having said that, if you added the next five largest issuers up in the small business space, I have the same refrain that I've had for the last two years we're bigger than them all put together. So we're really comfortable where we are, we don't see anything from a competitive perspective that is any different other than it keeps to step up the competition. But, and we continue to add to our rate of products, whether it's working capital terms, whether it's merchant financing, cross border and obviously the continued enhancements to our small business products. So we still feel really good about where we are in this small business perspective.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Maybe just to follow up with some of the lines of questioning previously. When you guys think about your comfort in delivering the high levels of revenue growth next year, which I assume is within the range of what we saw in 2019, how possible is it to hit those numbers with some more moderation and build business volumes? Is your level of comfort because you feel like some of the investments you've made will sustain that type of build business growth or do you expect the high levels of fee income growth will persist. Given the Delta fees, come on in 2020. Any color would be helpful. Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yes, I mean look, I think you know when you're making - here's the issue right, so many investments that you make this year don't pay off this year, they pay off as it goes next year. And so you've hit the nail on the head. When you think about sort of what we've done from a delta perspective when you think about the cards that we've acquired, when you think about some of the investments that we've made in some of the digital properties. When you think about sort of the consistent high discount revenue that we've had, yes, even would to tick down in billings that still will be positive and yet our fee revenue due to our continued maniacal focus on Card refreshes. The other thing I would point out is that this is a growth story globally. This is not a growth story just in the United States. And so when you think about 14% billings growth in consumer internationally, 18% SME growth even a tick or two down there is not really going to hurt you all that much and we've been pretty consistent from an SME and consumer perspective. So I think when you think about the three-legged stool that we have from a revenue perspective of fees, interest income and discount revenue, we feel really comfortable, and that's why, as Jeff said in his sort of at the end of his remarks in this same economic environment we feel good about 8 to 10. Look the billings issue weren't exactly what we had projected and look where we are from a revenue perspective. So, yes, our comfort level is there.\nRosie Perez: With that, we'll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff.

Welcome to the American Express Q1 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Rosie Perez. Please go ahead.\nRosie Perez: Thank you, Alan. Good morning. Appreciate all of you joining us for today\u2019s call. The discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future financial performance and business prospects, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today\u2019s presentation slides and in the company\u2019s reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2019 earnings release and presentation slides, as well as the earnings material for prior periods that may be discussed, all of which are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today\u2019s discussion. Today\u2019s discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company\u2019s progress and results, and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remark, we\u2019ll move to a Q&A session on the financial results, with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks, Rosie. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. As our second quarter results showed, we continue to build on the broad based momentum we entered the year with. FX adjusted revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 10% and earnings per share of $2.07 was 13% higher than last year. I feel good about these results, as well as the breadth and consistency of our performance. This is the eighth straight quarter we posted FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% [ph] or better. And our growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of spending, fees and loans spread across geographies and customer segments. We continue to see solid trends in Card Member spending led by consumers. This spending is occurring as the backdrop of an economy that is growing at a steady, with more modest pace relative to 2018. FX adjusted proprietary billings grew 8% on a consolidated basis and loan growth remained strong with over 60% of that growth coming from existing customers. Credit continued to perform at industry leading levels, driven by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk management capabilities and the opportunity we have to increase our share of our customers lending wallets. The consistent growth we're seeing speaks to the strength of our differentiated business model and the success of our focus on our four strategic imperatives. It\u2019s been a busy first half of the year and I thought it would be good to take a step back and reflect on some of the progress we\u2019re making in each of our priority areas. In the Consumer space, we\u2019re continuing our disciplined approach globally to upgrade our premium card products, enhancing our unique value propositions and pricing for the additional value that we\u2019re delivering to our card members. In the second quarter, we launched new and refreshed Platinum Cards in the UK, Italy, Finland, Norway and Sweden. And in early July, we launched an enhanced Platinum Card in Germany. We also made several additional enhancements to the Gold Card in the US and earlier in the year, we launched the new suite of co-branded Marriott Bonvoy cards. In each case, we\u2019re leveraging our differentiated business model to offer unique benefits, services and experiences to our card members in categories of travel, dining, and access to popular events and experiences. These are some of the aspects of our products that are more difficult for others to replicate, and they are the ones that our card members most value and are willing to pay for. In fact, nearly 70% of the new consumer cards we acquired this quarter carry an annual fee, and card fee revenue grew 17% year-over-year and accelerated sequentially quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we\u2019re seeing strong results in attracting next-generation consumers to the franchise, with our most recent US consumer product refreshes more than 50% of our new card members are millennials or Gen Zers. I believe we have a long runway to continue this growth. Turning to Commercial Payments, scaling our B2B payment offerings is one of our key growth strategies. Expanding our network of strategic partnerships is a key enabler here and we\u2019re making great progress. Our commercial customers increasingly want payments integrated into their Procure to Pay infrastructure, and we\u2019re developing a range of solutions, which do that for businesses of all sizes and complexities. For example, we\u2019re partnering with providers like Amazon Business, Tradeshift, and most recently SAP Ariba to help large and global companies track and reconcile payments within their ERP systems. For our larger SME customers who are looking for ways to increase efficiency and cash flow. We're working with companies like Wax and MineralTree on payment solutions by integrating their accounting and procurement systems. And for our small business customers, who are offering an AP Automation solution with Bill.com that makes it easier for them to pay their suppliers using our cards. Our objective is to provide payment capabilities and financing solutions that help our customers manage and grow their business. We want them to view American Express as an essential partner, whether they\u2019re single proprietorship or a Fortune 500 company. We're still in a relatively early stage of this journey, but we\u2019re making good progress in building out our B2B offerings, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in this area going forward. Moving on to our third imperative of strengthening our global integrated network. We\u2019re on track to achieve our goal of virtual parity coverage in the US by year end. We\u2019re also making good progress on expanding merchant coverage internationally and building our network in China. In the second quarter, we announced that card members can now tap and pay with their contactless-enabled American Express Cards or digital wallets for subway and bus rides in New York City, as part of the MTA's new pilot program. This is just another example of the vast array of opportunities in the payment space, as contactless will convert more cash transactions to mobile and plastic. Once consumers have experienced the speed, convenience and security of contactless payments in public transit, they are more likely to tap and pay at other establishments, such as quick service restaurants, retailers and more. We\u2019ll continue to expand our contactless capabilities in the US and internationally both through third party mobile providers and through the issuance of contactless enabled cards. We're also working with merchants to expand contactless acceptance in order to give our card members more options for easy and efficient ways to pay. Our fourth imperative, making American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives, cuts across all of our lines of business. We know that our card members spend much of their time online, particularly on their mobile devices. We want to help them manage more aspects of their lives by integrating more content, capabilities, experiences and benefits into all of the ways we interact digitally with them. We\u2019re making good progress on this front, and to accelerate our efforts we\u2019ve acquired a number of digital companies over the past 18 months including Mezi, LoungeBuddy, Cake Technologies, Pocket Concierge and our newest acquisition Resy, the US restaurant booking and management platform, which we announced in May. These acquisitions along with new digital features and contents we\u2019re continually building in-house, will enable our card members to do more with their American Express membership directly from their mobile device, whether it\u2019s getting a recommendation for a new restaurant, finding tickets to popular events, reserving a spot at the nearest airport lounge, redeeming rewards points for a wide variety of merchandise and experiences, saving money at some of their favorite merchants or booking travel. Today our card members are engaging with our app more frequently and on a wider range of activities in addition to performing traditional transactions by checking their spending and paying their bills. We expect this to increase as we work to integrate more new capabilities and benefits. In summary, I feel good about the quarter and I like where we stand at the halfway point of the year. Our strategy of investing in share, scale and relevance and leveraging the power of our differentiated business model is paying off across the enterprise. This strategy is driving growth in spending, lending, customer acquisitions and engagement across businesses and geographies. Our results give us confidence that we\u2019re on the right track to delivering on our goal of consistent revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance for the full year of delivering revenue in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted earnings per share of between $7.85 and $8.35. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jeff with detailed discussion about our second quarter results and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, thanks Steve. And good morning, everyone. And yes we are having our call in the morning instead of our historical evening timeslot after trying it in the morning last quarter due to the holiday calendar, we felt the timing worked a bit better for us from a process standpoint, and from feedback from many of you, it sounds like many of you prefer a morning call as well. With that, it\u2019s good to be here today. Let\u2019s talk about another solid quarter in 2019 and about another quarterly example of the consistent performance we have been delivering for some time now. Let\u2019s get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Second quarter revenues of $10.8 billion grew 10% on an FX adjusted basis. As Steve mentioned, I think it bears repeating this is the eighth straight quarter of having FX adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better. And importantly for the future, this growth continues to be driven by a well balanced mix of growth and spend lend and fee revenues, across geographies and across customer segments. I would point out that we continue to see a stronger US dollar relative to last year against most of the major currencies in which we operate. So you again see a spread between our reported revenue growth of 8% and our FX adjusted revenue growth of 10%. As you recall, the year-over-year strengthening of the US dollar against the major currencies in which we operate began in the third quarter of last year. So assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, you should see reported and FX adjusted revenue growth levels more similar to each other in the second half of 2019. Our strong topline performance drove net income of $1.8 million, up 9% from a year ago and then aided by our assumption of a more typical level of share repurchases over the last four quarters, our EPS was $2.07, representing double-digit EPS growth of 13% in the second quarter. Looking now at the details of our performance, I\u2019ll start with billed business, which you\u2019ve seen several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, our FX adjusted total billings growth for the second quarter was 7% in line with Q1. As we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes, we think it's important to continue to break out our billings growth trends between our proprietary and network businesses. Our proprietary business which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was up 8% in the second quarter on an FX adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which come from our network business, GNS, was down 2% in the quarter and an FX adjusted basis. This is less of a decline than prior quarters as we are getting closer to lapping the impact of exiting our network partnerships in the European Union and Australia. Turning to Slide 5, you will recall that during our last earnings call in April, we saw the full impact of lapping a step up in the growth in spending from our existing customers that began in the late Q4 of 2017 and became even more evident in Q1 of 2018. We attributed that acceleration which occurred across geographies and customer segments to an increase in confidence in our customer base. To bring this comment up to date, our Q2 2019 results show a continuation of the Q1 2019 trends, solid and steady growth though at a more modest pace relative to 2018. If you then turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer-type for the second quarter, starting on the left with a large and global commercial customers, we saw a 5% growth on an FX adjusted basis for the second quarter, in line with Q1 and our small and mid-sized enterprise card members or SMEs in the US grew 7% in the second quarter. We feel good about our continued leadership position with both of these customer types. I would suggest that the growth levels here are reflective of the economic tones Steve discussed, stable and growing, though at more modest levels than the very robust growth we saw in 2018. But also note that we will continue to watch these two commercial customer types closely to determine whether we are seeing perhaps a bit of caution in our commercial spending trends which we are not seeing in the consumer segment at this time. International SME, however, remains our highest growth customer type with 17% FX adjusted growth in the second quarter. During Investor Day, we highlighted the long-term growth opportunity in this segment, given the low penetration we have in the top countries where we operate international small business products and we continue to believe we have a long runway for higher levels of growth in this segment. Moving to US consumer which made up of 32% of the company\u2019s billings in the second quarter, billings were up 8%, reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers, and in general, solid growth on the part of consumers. Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the teens at 15% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth in our proprietary business across key countries with double-digit growth in Mexico and Australia and growth of 20% and 18% for the UK and Japan, respectively. Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 2% on an FX adjusted basis, driven by the impact of regulation in the European Union and Australia where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 6% on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate. Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. We continued, as we have for years now, to grow a little faster than the industry by taking advantage of the unique opportunity that our historical under penetration of our own customer\u2019s card-based borrowing behaviors creates. Total loan growth was 11% in the second quarter, with over 60% of that growth coming from our existing customers. And on the right hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.8%, up 20 basis points relative to the prior year. While we\u2019ve been saying for some time that these yield increases were going to moderate, we are pleased that our yield is still increasing year-over-year from continued impacts from mix and pricing for risk. Slide 8 then shows you the credit implications of our strategy. On the left you can see that the lending write-off rate was 2.3% in the second quarter, up 20 basis points from the prior year and in line with the first quarter. On the right, you can see that the charged write-off rate, excluding GCP was 1.7%, down 10 basis points for the prior year, as well as the prior quarter. You\u2019ll also see the delinquency and GCP net loss ratio trends. All of these lead to the same conclusion we have reached in recent quarters. We still do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment, both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these portfolios are performing better than we expected so far this year. So given these credit metric and loan volume trends, you can see on Slide 9 the provision expense was $861 million in the second quarter, up just 7%, while loans, as I said earlier, were up 11%. As you think about this relationship, I would remind you that we have talked in a few forums [ph] about how we have been evolving over the past year a number of the things we\u2019re doing on the risk management side, to create a greater margin of safety and position us well for any potential future downturn. These changes, coupled with the stable economic environment and the fact that we are acquiring a higher percentage of new accounts on premium fee-based products, are driving our provision cost to be below our original expectations. As you think about the full year, during our first quarter earnings call we said we expected provision growth in the mid-20% range in 2019. Given the positive underlying trends we have seen in the first half of the year, I would now expect to do better than this, with provision growth below 20% for the full year. While we\u2019re on the subject of provision, let me take a few minutes to step away from our results and talk about CECL. We've made good progress on our implementation efforts, though there is a lot of work left before implementation on January 1 of next year. Based on our work so far, we estimate that if we implemented CECL this quarter, our current total reserves of $2.9 billion would increase by roughly 25% to 40%. This estimate includes a roughly 55% to 70% increase in lending card reserves, somewhat offset by a significantly lower charge card reserve, due to the extremely short life of charge receivable. To be clear, the ultimate impact will depend on the loan and receivable portfolio compositions, macroeconomic conditions and forecast of the adoption date, as well as other factors including the remaining management judgments as we finish off our modeling. I would leave you on CECL though with three important takeaways. First, remember that CECL represents an accounting driven acceleration of estimated losses. There is no change to the underlying economics, our view of the risk portfolio or the ultimate expected losses in our portfolios. Second for us given our strong balance sheet, 30% plus return on equity and spend-centric model, the capital impact of the one-time implementation increase in reserves will likely very be manageable. Third, while the impact of implementation is getting the majority of the attention to date, it is important to keep in mind that CECL will have an impact on our provision expense going forward. The ultimate impact will of course be heavily [Technical Difficulty] However, the growth in our lending portfolio, which has been higher than the industry, coupled with the increased reserve requirement for loans, will very likely result in incremental provision expense under CECL relative to the current accounting methodology. So now let\u2019s get back to our results. In terms of the strong revenue growth of 10% on an FX adjusted basis that you see on Slide 10, we see our eighth straight quarters of FX adjusted revenue growth being at least 8%, as evidence that our focus on investing in share scale and relevance is working. And this growth is driven by broad-based growth across spend lend and fee revenues as you can see on Slide 11. Importantly, the portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained at roughly 80% in the second quarter, in line with the recent history. Discount revenue was up 6% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX adjusted basis, which I\u2019ll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees growth accelerated to 17% in the second quarter. This is the financial outcome of the disciplined approach to product refreshment, our unique value propositions, and our focus on fee-based products that Steve talked about in his opening remarks. And we feel good about our ability to maintain this strong growth in net card fees given the breadth of products that are driving our momentum. Net interest income grew at 13% in the second quarter driven by growth in loans and net yield. Now I know that many of you are focused on the outlook for interest rates, and what that means for various financial companies, given that the latest rate projections are a bit lower than they were at the beginning of the year. I would remind you that for us, the impact of modest changes in rates is fairly muted. Our sizable charge portfolio does mean that our balance sheet is a bit liability sensitive, but we manage our funding stack to keep that sensitivity in a range. If you look at our latest 10-Q - excuse me, 10-K disclosures, it implies that a 25 basis point increase in rates would cost us about $0.01 of EPS a quarter on a run rate basis over the ensuing year. All else equal, including a beta on our deposit account in line with recent history, the impact of a 25 basis point decrease would be similar in size. Keep in mind as well of course, that today\u2019s modestly lower rate outlook is caused by a view that the economy is a bit weaker, which would tend to move our overall results in the opposite direction of the rate impact itself. Putting this all together, I don\u2019t expect current changes in interest rate expectations to have a material impact on our 2019 results. Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. On the right you see that discount revenue grew in line with billings in the second quarter at 7% on an FX adjusted basis, making this the seventh consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%. We see this as continued strong evidence that our strategy of focusing on driving discount revenue not the average discount rate is working. Moving on now to the things we are doing to drive our strong revenue growth, let\u2019s start with our customer engagement cost, which you can see on Slide 13 were $5 billion in the second quarter, up 11% versus last year, a bit more than revenue. Turning at the bottom with marketing and business development, I\u2019d remind you that this line has two components, our traditional marketing and promotional expenses, as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Marketing and business development costs were up 7% in Q2. There are two offsetting impacts to mention on this slide. First, our marketing spending will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters in 2019, driving lower growth in marketing and business development in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, as we grow over the launch of our global brand campaign in the second quarter of last year. Offsetting this impact this quarter is the expected $200 million increase in 29 [ph] marketing and business development, driven by the extension we signed in Q1 of our enterprise-wide Delta partnership. This impact will be spread across three quarters beginning with our second quarter results. Moving onto rewards expense, you can see that it was up 9% relative to the prior year broadly in line with proprietary billed business growth. Continuing on to Card Member services, as you have seen for sometime and as we continue to expect Card Member services costs were our fastest growing expense line up 35% in the second quarter, as this line includes many components of our differentiated value propositions, which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based product. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the level of customer engagement we see with our premium benefits and services. That then brings us to the operating expense line on Slide 14, which was up 7% in the quarter. While there is always some variability in OpEx quarter-to-quarter, I would say that some of the drivers of our strong revenue performance, growth in sales force, premium servicing and digital capabilities will cause us for this year to see more growth in this line than we have seen in recent years. That said, we have a long track record of getting operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues, and we are confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so. Turning to capital. On Slide 15 our CET1 ratio in the second quarter was 11% at the top end of our 10% to 11% of target range and we returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders. As you know in previous years, we\u2019ve issued a press release at the end of the CCAR process announcing our capital plan. Since we were not subject to the CCAR process this year we chose not to issue a press release in June. As we\u2019ve said, the reality is going forward our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 capital ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the governor of our capital distribution plans. Now we\u2019ve historically been very focused on maintaining capital strength, while aggressively returning excess capital to our shareholders, and you should expect us to continue that philosophy. In terms of what this means going forward, I\u2019d reiterate the same philosophy we have talked about all this year. First, remember that our industry leading ROE, which was 32% this quarter, means we generate a tremendous amount of capital each year. In deploying this capital our philosophy is straightforward. You can expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings as it has historically. Consistent with this, you may have noticed in our press release today that we intend to increase our dividend from $0.39 to $0.43 subject to board approval, beginning with the declaration in Q3, \u201819 and payable in Q4, \u201819. We\u2019ll then use a modest portion of our capital generated to continue to support our organic growth and if you look at the last 18 months, the occasional small acquisition. And we will return the remainder of our capital to our shareholders, while managing within the 10% to 11% CET1 target range. To sum up before we open the call for your questions, our solid performance in the first half of the year reflects our investment strategy focused on share scale and relevance, delivering high levels of revenue growth and steady and consistent EPS growth. For the full year 2019, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and having our adjusted earnings per share to be between $7.85 and $8.35. During our earnings call in January and Investor Day in March, we said that the lower end of the EPS range is there, if there is some more significant economic slowdown relative to 2018. Halfway through 2019 we continue to see a stable and growing economy, though not quite at the robust levels of growth we saw in 2018 as we put our 2019 plan together. In addition we've had a few changes relative to our regional outlook for the year. Most significantly, we have a $200 million increase to marketing and business development from the Delta renewal, which you saw beginning in our results for the second quarter and going in the other direction, we have more favorable credit performance relative to our initial expectation. Given where we are today, I would expect our full year EPS results to be more in line with the middle part of our original guidance range. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rosie.\nRosie Perez: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I\u2019ll ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I\u2019ll start off with where you ended Jeff on the guidance. You mentioned the middle part of the range and thinking through the $200 million and the favorable provision, it would seem to me like the provision given the credit trajectory has been trending better roughly in the $200 million. Perhaps you can just reconcile that for me? And then as far as the CECL numbers you gave in terms of the quantification, I was just doing the back of the envelope on the percentage you mentioned. And if we were to assume a sort of similar environment to this year, it would seem like the provision might go up low single digits percentage wise. I know there is a lot of assumptions. Can you just help us think through that? Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: So two good questions Sanjay. Thank you for them. First, on the guidance. I\u2019d really say there is three things going on all of which I talked about in my remarks. You\u2019re correct, U.K. added $200 million of costs this year due to the tremendous new long-term agreement we have with Delta. It\u2019s a great thing for shareholders long-term. Offsetting that provision is clearly much better than we had expected. And I\u2019d say you're right that benefit is probably a little bit bigger than the $200 million. But I think the third thing to recall is if you go back Sanjay to the January call when we first talked about guidance, I said at the time that in the world where 2019 turns out to look kind of like 2018 in terms of the economy, you should expect us to be in the middle or upper part of the range. You know, in fact, while the economy is stable, it is clearly growing at a more modest level than it was in 2019 - 2018 when we put our plan together based on the more robust growth you saw in 2018. So, it's a little bit of softness in volume relative to our expectation. And so that\u2019s really the missing third piece. All that said, eight straight quarters of revenue growth above 8%, 10% revenue growth this quarter we feel tremendous about the momentum. On the CECL side, boy, predicting the ongoing P&L impact of CECL Sanjay has so many moving parts right now, I am reluctant to give you a number. All I was trying to do on the call at this point is begin to focus people a little bit on the fact that for us the one time increase in reserves given the strength of our balance sheet and ROE, it doesn\u2019t have any material impact I think in our capital returns. But the ongoing provision costs depending on the environment is something that you will probably hear us continue to talk about and I think your back of the envelope is as good as any. I just cautioned that there could be lots of different factors that affect it going forward. So thanks for the question Sanjay.\nOperator: And for our next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Jeff I think most financial institutions have put out a buyback discussion. I know you provided some general background. Is there any reason why you're not talking specifically about that? And then secondarily, what is your general thought on operating leverage or lack thereof? Obviously, your OpEx expense is growing at a more rapid pace. But if you sort of layer in engagement cost, are your expenses going to grow faster than your revenues?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes. So, two things. First, on capital, Don, we said for a while now that the governor of how we manage our share repurchase is that we intend to keep that CET1 ratio in the 10% to 11% range and that is actually more important than where we are with the Fed. And so depending on our earnings, depending on our levels of organic growth, that\u2019s how you should expect us to move the share repurchase up and down. Now, all that said, that means share repurchase have leveled very similar to what you\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve rebuilt the balance sheet post the Tax Act charge. But that\u2019s really the way I encourage everyone to think about our capital return not \u2013 that we are no longer in this world where the CCAR outcomes are governing what we\u2019re doing on capital and so we\u2019re going to return exactly that amount of capital. On leverage, boy, I think we\u2019re just executing Don on the financial and business model that we\u2019ve been talking about ever since Steve became CEO last February, which is, we\u2019re generating industry\u2019s leading levels of revenue growth. We think that\u2019s the best way to create value for our shareholders long term. Customer engagement cost has been and, I expect, will continue to grow a little faster than our revenues and so that creates a little bit of margin compression. That\u2019s mitigated by the fact that we expect operating expenses to grow less than revenue, they have for a decade, we\u2019re highly confident that they will continue to. And then you add a little bit of share repurchase to all that and you get a double-digit EPS growth. Now, that does mean that PTI, in any given period may grow a little faster or a little slower than revenue. But we think this is the right strategy, focused on share, scale and relevance for creating the most value for our shareholders in the long term.\nOperator: For our next question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yeah. Thank you. It seemed like the US consumer might have been the biggest source of strength in the quarter. I think you guys \u2013 you had proprietary billables and it's actually declined modestly Q-over-Q, but your discount revenue growth accelerated. Was that due to the acceleration in the US consumer where presumably you have higher discount rate revenue? And then also, just higher level, what are you seeing from the US consumer? Are they being more resilient for some of the uncertainties we\u2019re seeing around things like the China trade issues that they may be having maybe a bigger impact on the corporate side?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, maybe I\u2019ll start Mark on the math and, Steve, you might add a little bit of color. Look, I think, when you look sequentially, sure as you\u2019ve heard from many people, the consumer is strong and you did see in the US Consumer business a little bit of a modest uptick in billings sequentially. You know, all that said, I think, we see overall stability, but at more modest levels than last year. Commercial spending is still at a good level, but I exercise - I noted a little bit of caution. We just have our eye on that a little bit more than the consumer. So I don\u2019t know, Steve, maybe you want to add a little bit of color.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. I mean, look, I think that international is still strong as well. I mean, you had 17% international SME growth, you have 15% international consumer growth. But just a comment in US SME. I think when we dig into the numbers in US SME, what I always look at is, how are we bringing on new booked business. So that\u2019s from new signings and that\u2019s been stable for a long time. How are we looking at the attrition and that\u2019s also been very stable. What you see and I think this is to Jeff's point, what you see is maybe a little less confidence that the consumer from an SME perspective where there is been organic decline from what we would say, pretty much all time highs from what we\u2019re growing over, but it\u2019s still positive. So that's US SME. And I think large corporate, you know, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with large corporate, especially when we had such a breakout year, I think, last year from large and global corporate accounts. So I think the commercial side of the business is being slightly more cautious than the consumer side. And I think you\u2019ve heard that as you listen to other earnings calls this week as well. So - but still strong, I mean, still strong growth. \nOperator: And our next question will be from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just to pick up on those comments with international SME. I know it\u2019s been on a little bit of a decelerating trend here 17% is still a very strong number, but it was - I believe 25% is recently the year ago. So you\u2019ve got some tough comps you\u2019re working through. I guess as those - trying to get easier for the next few quarters is it essentially and obviously you see some reacceleration in international SME? And then if you can just separately make a quick comment on the sustainability of the card fee growth which continues to be very impressive that would be great? Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yeah. So I think I got the question with a little bit of the background noise. But look, I mean, if you look at what was going on for international SME for pretty much like six quarters prior to this, you had sort of the long run of 20% growth, but often relatively smaller base. I am pretty happy where we are with 17% international SME growth. We continue to invest not only in the value propositions, but in the sales organizations, and our absolute numbers are actually getting bigger and bigger. So I am not really worried at all about 17% international SME growth. Our performance there has been, I think really outstanding. So we\u2019re going to - and we're going to continue to invest. I mean, that\u2019s one of the reasons why you saw a little bit of an uptick sort of an operating expenses is we\u2019re investing in sales organizations not only international SME, but we\u2019re investing in some sales resources as well as it relates to - international coverage. So you have some extra OpEx as it relates to that. As far as card \u2013 as far as card fees go, you know, card fees is all about adding value to the products and we will continue on our quest to continue to add differentiated value on an ongoing basis to all of our products around the globe. We have taken a very deliberate step to make sure that we are constantly looking at and refreshing these products on a very proactive basis. And by doing that, that enables us to continue to add tremendous pace that we\u2019ve been on in terms of card fee acceleration. I mean, you saw 17% card fee growth year-over-year, and you even saw a sequential uptick, and 70% of the cards that we acquired, our fee-based cards and people are paying for those cards because they are getting value out of those cards. And so it is how our model has been for decades, and we will continue to invest in those value propositions so that we can continue to generate card fees.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Go ahead.\nJames Friedman: Hi. Thank you. It's Jamie. Steve, I wanted to ask you about the M&A strategy. You had some activity year-to-date. How would you describe the themes in M&A, because some of it seems consumer oriented, but some of it seems merchant oriented like your last couple \u2013 if you could provide some instruction about how you\u2019re thinking about M&A would be helpful?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. So, look for every business, we have an opportunity to grow sort of three different ways, right? You grow from organic growth, you grow through partnerships, and you grow through acquisitions. I think, if you look at the last sort of five acquisitions or so, and I think you picked up on a really important point with Resy but I'll get to that in a minute. But if you really look at the last five acquisitions, while you can say they are consumer rated, consumer driven what they really are is all about embedding ourselves more in our customers digital lives. And those customers are not only consumers, but they are small business, and they're corporate card customers. So maybe for a business process perspective, we\u2019re not - we haven't done any M&A in that area. But when you think about what we've done, it first started out, and we started with some building blocks. We started out with Mezi which is digital based AI assist and now we\u2019ve roll that out in the UK and we\u2019re testing that in the US with some of our platinum cardholders. And then we went with Cake, which is really sort of middleware to help us sort of manage our restaurant reservation. We went with Pocket Concierge, which Japan is a really important market for us and that gave us access to some of the best restaurants in Japan. And then we went with LoungeBuddy because our focus has been on providing a great experience end-to-end for the travelers. And while I'm not going to be able to build hundreds of lounges, we\u2019ve got 12 right now and will continue to add them selectively as we go along. LoungeBuddy from a mobile perspective will show our customers exactly where other lounges are and we get access to lots of the lounges. And then the last one Resy, which is really sort of two-pronged and I think we probably not done a good enough job talking about the merchant side of this. But it will give us access to some of the what we believe is some of the finest restaurants and actually one of the more requested restaurants from our card members and be able to not only provide special Card Member offers, but to also be able to acquire new card members when they actually use the Resy app and seeing what our existing card members were getting. And for restaurants, the thing that we love Resy is they look at the fact that they have two customers. They have the card, they have the diner as a customer, and they have the restaurant and the customers, and restaurants are really important partners for us. And so what you\u2019re seeing is a concept - a continue to build out whether it be organically partnership or via acquisition. And remember we had a partnership with LoungeBuddy before this to constantly and consistently move more upstream or in-stream into our customers digital lives. So we\u2019ll be opportunistic. We\u2019ll continue to look for those companies either from a partnership perspective or an acquisition perspective that will continue to build-out our digital capabilities. And we\u2019ll continue to look on the commercial side, but I don't want you to think its all consumer, because small businesses can use this and our corporate card customers can use this as well.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go now to the line up David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. And good morning. You\u2019ve been repositioning American Express in Europe over the last year principally winding down GNS. With the next wave of payment regulation coming PSD2 on September 14th along with strong customer authentication requirements, is there more to do, you signaled on the last call you might introduce a debit card for example. I'd be curious for your updated thoughts?\nStephen Squeri: No. I don't know that we - yeah, well actually yes. Not necessarily a debit card, but access for sort of more real-time payments, but - with PSIP. But I think that we\u2019ll wind down Europe by the end of this year, and so you won't have that grow over. Our value propositions are very strong in Europe. We still - the reason we - just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, the reason we wound this done is, we wanted to stay as a three party scheme versus a four party scheme, which aspects of our business in Europe were four-party, which enables us to have a better, not only better value proposition, but in fact a higher discount rate as it relates to our transactions there. But I don\u2019t see us introducing a debit card per se, and I think we\u2019ll just continue on our path of increasing our value to our customers both from small business perspective and from a consumer perspective.\nJeffrey Campbell: And the only thing I\u2019d add, David on your specific question around September 14th deadline on merchants having better than authentication capabilities, we\u2019re working with our merchants. It\u2019s not a big cost for us. It\u2019s really a merchant question. We don\u2019t expect it to cause any significant inflection point. There is some talk about banks deferring a little bit because not all merchants were ready to launch. But I don\u2019t see it as a big issue.\nStephen Squeri: No actually and we\u2019ll leverage our safety technology to do that. But in fact it's really more about conversations and visits with merchants more than just technology and we\u2019ve been really ahead of the curve on that in educating merchants on how to interact. So not a cost issue for us at all.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go now to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. You started to kind of discuss some of the aspects of this. But could you talk a little bit about the - how would you expect the SME business to perform both in terms of kind of growth rate and in terms of credit as the economy looks to be a little more variable? Is it more or less kind of volatile than the consumer side?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, we feel really good about the breadth of our small business franchise. As you know Moshe we talk a lot about the fact that we are in the US larger than our next five competitors combined outside the US where we have some of the highest growth rates in the company. Our shares tend to be small and we think we have a very long run way to continue to grow. We are broadly speaking and I am actually going to take your question beyond just small business, one of the things you've heard me talk about in my prepared remarks is we actually have been making some changes in all of our risk management practices steadily across the last year. That\u2019s both a consumer and a small business issue because they are both so important to us. And in fact those changes are part along with a stable economic environment of what\u2019s driving stronger than expected credit performance for us provision actually being up less than loan. So all of those things we think help prepare us to continue to perform strongly in all economic environments. We always spend a lot of time thinking about how we manage the company through all aspects of an economic cycle. We make every economic decision around customers assuming through the cycle view of the economics. So we feel good about where we are in our preparation.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. The other point that I would make is when you look at international SME, it\u2019s predominantly if not 100% a charged business for us, and which has a lot less - obviously, a lot less volatility. And our small business portfolio is more heavily charge based than our - in fact our consumer portfolio as well.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Instinet. Go ahead please.\nJeffrey Campbell: Good morning, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Jeff, I wanted to follow up on some of your comments regarding the rate environment. I understand your point that there is a natural buffer in your business model based on the interplay between a stronger or weaker economy and higher or lower rates. But to the extent that the Fed is turning more accommodative in an effort to extend the cycle and not because economic conditions are deteriorating then wouldn\u2019t that be a scenario where lower rates would benefit you? And Steve if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on the digital investments that you guys are making, specifically on cloud you\u2019ve guys have talked about pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy versus a public cloud strategy that some of your competitors are pursuing. Is there any concern that you may be falling behind your competitors relative to the investments that they are making? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: So, let me - I'll answer the second one. No, I think look having been CIO of this company and spent 10 years running technology, I am really comfortable with where we are. From an economic perspective, the reason we have a hybrid strategy is we believe that on an ongoing basis, we have better economics by running our own private clouds. Now that may not be the case with everybody else. But when you go to one of the cloud providers, you have a situation where there is obviously just profit built in. So as we focused on our infrastructure and if you look at our technology cost over a long period of time, our run the - our run the company cost are best in class and they have been decreasing over time. So I am really comfortable with where we are from a hybrid strategy perspective. And what you do is you look to put workloads out there that are variable in nature. And so I think having a hybrid strategy really works well for us because it enables us not to have some of the fixed cost investment that you would just need to have on a variable basis. So, I don\u2019t see we\u2019re falling behind at all, and I think we might have been a little bit ahead with the hybrid strategy that we have deployed.\nJeffrey Campbell: And Bill on rates. Look I\u2019d just started by reminding everyone that 80% of our revenues come from spend and fee revenues. So just the math starts with the fact that relative to any other financial institution, we\u2019re just far less sensitive in terms of our overall economics to where our rates are going. Second, we do manage our funding stack in terms of our fixed floating mix to keep our exposure to changes in rates pretty modest and that\u2019s why in my prepared remarks I pointed out that when you think about a 25 basis point change, it\u2019s $0.01 a quarter. And then assuming quarters third, there is this economic offset, right? I think in response to Sanjay\u2019s first question, I did point out that the economy is growing slowly than it was last year as the rate environment or the rate outlook has come down a little bit, that\u2019s because people are worried about the economy. That provides a little bit of a natural offset to even a modest impact that rates do. So, look, we pay attention to rates. I am just making a general point that when you net it all out for us, I don\u2019t see modest changes in the rate environment up and down as something that\u2019s going to move the needle in our overall earnings. I think operator let\u2019s keep going and probably squeeze in one or two more here.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Hecht: Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Your discount rate has been very stable year-over-year and I know you\u2019ve taken specific guidance regarding the discount rate off the table. But I am wondering if you can tell us is there any trends whether you\u2019re looking by channel, by region, by product or mix shift? Is there any trends underlying that we should think about for the next couple of quarters?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I just remind you, yes, you are correct, we\u2019re focused on driving discount revenue which we feel great about not average discount rate. All of that said, we\u2019re also getting further from some of the things we\u2019ve talked about for a few years, the impact of regulation in Australia and the European Union. The impact about Blue, some big strategic deals we cut. And so those are having an impact on the average discount rate. But the thing that I just want to emphasize is, we feel good about the discount revenue trajectory. That's what we\u2019re focused on driving and the rate will average - discount rate will kind of go where it will. Operator?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead please.\nCraig Maurer: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the Blue Business Cash Card that you put a release out on yesterday. You talked about the invoicing product and that you were launching effectively what seems like a working capital program that will be paid over ACH. Curious is that a new offering? How are you marketing it, how big is it today if it's not a new offering? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: So actually the working capital product's been out there for a couple of years now, which - maybe you got sort of mixed up in this - in the Blue Cash announcement. But the working capital product has been out there for quite a long time, a couple of years. It is relatively small and it does ride over ACH rails. And what we want do is remember, what we wanted to do with small businesses is to help run their businesses and part - the role that the card plays is part of their overall working capital solution. And so there are suppliers and there are merchants that do not accept credit card payments of any type, not just American Express with Visa and MasterCard. And so to be able to provide, along with providing the card product, to be able to provide a working capital product as well to these customers, helps them manage their business and helps them manage their cash flow. And the reality is these are loans that are anywhere from 30 to 90 days.\nCraig Maurer: How big is it?\nStephen Squeri: It's very tiny.\nRosie Perez: Okay. With that, we\u2019ll bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you again for joining today\u2019s call and thank you for your continued interest in American Express.

Welcome to the American Express Q1 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Edmund Reese. Please go ahead.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Allen. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains a -- certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties.

Today's discussion will begin with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start the call with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our first quarter financial performance. Once Jeff completes his remark, we'll move to a Q&A session on the financial results with both Steve and Jeff.  With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks, Edmund. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As our first quarter results showed, we had a solid start to the year. FX-adjusted revenues grew 9%, which marked the seventh consecutive quarter with FX-adjusted revenues up by at least 8%. Once again, this growth was broad-based and well balanced across spend, lend and fee revenues, reflecting the benefits of our integrated business model. Our adjusted EPS of $2.01 reflected good progress against our strategic imperatives as well as our focus on consistently investing in share, scale and relevance to drive growth.  We added 3.1 million new proprietary cards in Q1, driven primarily by our digital acquisition efforts. We continue to expand our merchant network in the U.S. and internationally and billings growth remained solid across customer segments and geographies. Loan growth continued to be strong and credit quality remained at industry-leading levels.  As you'll recall, we started the year with mixed signals in the economic environment. Since then, we've seen the economy grow at a steady pace, although not quite as strong as the robust levels we saw in 2018. Consistent with what we said at our Investor Day last month, we are not seeing any broad signals in our business of a significant economic downturn.  Looking ahead, we continue to see a number of attractive growth opportunities across our businesses. And as you've heard me say on many occasions, we're continuing to invest to take advantage of those opportunities in order to drive revenue growth over the moderate to longer term.  At our Investor Day, I also discussed 3 company-wide initiatives we're focusing on to help accelerate progress on our strategic imperatives. All 3 will build on and strengthen aspects of our business model that differentiate us from our competitors. As a reminder, these initiatives are as follows: We're focusing on our customer base as a platform for growth; we're adopting a more focused international strategy which is guiding how we manage our business outside the U.S.; and we're expanding our network of strategic partners to bring additional value propositions to our customers.  There's good progress to report on each of these priorities. We're seeing steady increases in customer engagement and acquisitions from our Member Get Member referral program as well as through our innovative lending offerings such as Pay It Plan It for consumers and working capital loans for our SME customers. We're generating strong billings across international especially in our consumer and SME segments, and we are driving increased merchant coverage. And we made a number of announcements regarding strategic partnerships since the beginning of the year.  I want to spend a few minutes on that last item. During the quarter, we renewed our relationship with Air Canada and revamped our consumer and commercial cards with Marriott's Bonvoy travel program. We acquired 2 digital platforms that we've been partnering with: Pocket Concierge, which provides restaurant reservations in Japan; and LoungeBuddy, which enables travelers to discover, book and access airport lounges worldwide. We announced the new AP Automation solution for SMEs with our partner, Bill.com. And we also announced the strategic partnership with SAP Ariba. And in China, we're continuing to make progress in developing our network offerings with our partner, Lianlian.  The biggest news of course was Delta. As you know, we announced an extension of our partnership with Delta Airlines that will take us to 2030. This is a terrific step forward for both Delta and for us. Delta is our largest program partnership and it's one of the most valuable portfolios in the industry. Our 11-year extension is groundbreaking and perhaps unprecedented in terms of its length and breadth. And I wanted to give you a sense of how excited we are about the value-creation opportunity it represents for both our customers and our shareholders.  First as a reminder, I talked at Investor Day about how the Delta partnership broadly fits with the 4 strategic imperatives that we're focused on. Delta shares our strong focus on a premium consumer customer base. Delta has a large base of business customers which provides many attractive opportunities to build on our strong position in commercial payments. Delta's global reach and scale help strengthen our merchant network in the U.S. and in many countries around the world. And last, Delta shares our focus on using technology capabilities to deliver digital experiences that help us become an essential part of our customers' digital lives. These common values are what has driven Delta to drive 8% of our billings and 20% of our lending today.  So with that as background, Delta's CEO, Ed Bastian and I started meeting on a regular basis shortly after I became CEO. It became clear very quickly that we both appreciated the importance of this partnership to our respective companies. It was also clear that we had a shared interest in working more closely together to build something even bigger and better for both companies.  Our existing agreement had 4 more years to run, but toward the end of last year, we started talking about the benefits of an early renewal. Given the potential we both saw, we wanted to think and act for the long term and avoid the short-term distractions or disruptions that could come if there was any uncertainty about the next stage of our partnership. We went to work on a renewal agreement so that we could focus our respective teams on growing the portfolio with innovative products and services for our customers. I feel great about where we came out and where we're going.  The Delta relationship is now positioned to remain a key element in our strategy of growing our share, scale and relevance, producing great returns for our shareholders. Delta will continue to be one of the fastest-growing parts of our business as it has been for years. I would remind you that spending on our Delta co-brand products has grown by double digits annually for many years. And together, we've acquired more than 1 million new accounts in each of the past 2 years.  With the certainty of our relationship now locked in until 2030, we can work together even more closely to sustain this momentum, growing the value every year for our mutual customers and for both partners. This means becoming even more integrated in our customer value propositions, digital efforts and how we run our businesses. As Ed Bastian said during Delta's earnings call last week, Delta will be investing alongside us to grow the portfolio and strengthen the ways we work together. Given this kind of commitment by both partners for the next 11 years and all the opportunities we see, I believe the Delta relationship will remain a key cornerstone of our growth across every dimension, including billings, lending, revenue, scale and profitability. So all in all, this is a great partnership for the customers and shareholders of both companies.  In summary, I feel good about the progress we are making as a business, about our results this quarter and about our prospects as we look at the rest of 2019. As we stated at Investor Day and most recently when we announced the Delta renewal, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year of delivering revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and adjusted earnings per share between $7.85 and $8.35. I remain excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.  Let me now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here today to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2019. Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. First quarter revenues of $10.4 billion grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis, with this growth again driven by a well-balanced mix of growth across discount revenue, fee revenue and net interest income. As Steve mentioned, but it bears repeating, this is now the seventh consecutive quarter with FX-adjusted revenue growth of 8% or better.  I would point out that as we continue to see a stronger U.S. dollar relative to last year against most major currencies in which we operate, our reported revenue growth is around 200 basis points below our FX-adjusted revenue growth. Now as you know, FX rates tend to move over time, and so we focus on FX-adjusted revenue growth trends. In fact, you might remember that just a year ago on this call, I was talking about 200 basis points of FX going in the other direction with our reported revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018 up 12% versus our FX-adjusted revenue growth of 10%.  Moving down to net income. Our reported net income of $1.6 billion includes an increase to our legal reserves related to certain merchant litigation that was scheduled for trial in June and has now been resolved. Our reported EPS of $1.80 includes a $0.21 impact related to this matter. Given the discrete nature of this $0.21 charge, we are going to focus today on our adjusted Q1 EPS of $2.01, up 8% from the prior year, as we think it is a better reflection of our operating performance.  Looking now at the details of that performance. I'll start with billed business, which you see several views of on Slides 4 through 6. Starting on Slide 4, we have broken out our billings growth between AXP proprietary and Global Network Services, our network business. As we continue to exit the network business in Europe and Australia due to certain regulatory changes, we think it's important to show these 2 trends separately. Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 9% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which come from our network business, GNS, was down 4% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the prior few quarters.  Turning to Slide 5, you will recall that during our earnings call in January and again at our Investor Day in March, I noted the growth in spending from our existing customers showed a step-up beginning late in Q4 of 2017 that became even more evident in Q1 of 2018. We attributed this acceleration, which occurred across geographies and the customer segments, to an increase in confidence in our customer base. As we got to the end of 2018, we began to lap that step-up. And in the first quarter, we see the full impact of that lapping dynamic resulting in a sequential deceleration in growth.  Now to keep this in perspective, Steve noted in his opening remarks that we've been seeing the economy grow at a solid, steady pace this year. And though I don't want to get into the habit on commenting on intra-quarter trends, I think it is important to note that we did see relatively stable growth throughout the first quarter.  If you then turn to Slide 6 to look at the billings by customer type for the first quarter, I would start by reminding you that our Global Commercial and Global Consumer segments are roughly the same size, representing 42% and 44% of Q1 billings, respectively, while Global Network Services makes up the remaining 14% of billings.  Starting on the left with a large and global customer segment, we saw a 5% growth on an FX-adjusted basis in the first quarter. I've mentioned before that growth in this segment can vary a bit quarter-to-quarter due to the large volumes a few customers can drive and due to the fact that this segment remained heavily T&E-oriented. More broadly on T&E, you can see in our earnings tables that we had solid growth in U.S. T&E spend of 5% in the quarter.  Moving on to our small and mid-sized enterprise Card Members, or SMEs, U.S. SME grew 8% in the first quarter. We feel good about our continued leadership position in the U.S. SME space and the continued strong acquisition performance we are seeing in the segment.  International SME remains our highest-growth customer segment with 19% FX-adjusted growth in the first quarter. During Investor Day, we highlighted the long-term growth opportunity in this segment given the low penetration we have in the top countries where we offer international small business products. And we continue to feel good about our long runway for growth in this segment.  Moving to U.S. consumer, which made up 32% of the company's billings in the first quarter, billings were up 7%, reflecting continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing customers despite the lapping impact that we've repeatedly discussed now as well as the Hilton portfolio acquisition in the first quarter of last year.  Moving to the right, international consumer growth remained in the high teens as it was for all of 2018 at 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. We continue to have widespread growth across countries, with double-digit growth in Mexico and Australia and growth of 20% and 18% for the U.K. and Japan, respectively.  Finally, on the far right, as I mentioned earlier, Global Network Services was down 4% on an FX-adjusted basis driven by the impacts of regulation in the European Union and Australia, where we are in the process of exiting our network business. Although network billings are down in these regions, if you were to exclude the European Union and Australia, the remaining portion of GNS was up 6% on an FX-adjusted basis.  Overall then, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we operate.  Turning next to loan performance on Slide 7. Total loan growth was 12% in the first quarter with nearly 60% of that growth, again, coming from our existing customers. We have now lapped the impact of the Hilton portfolio acquisition that took place in the first quarter of last year and contributed 120 basis points to growth in the fourth quarter.  On the right-hand side of Slide 7, you see that net interest yield was 10.9%, up 10 basis points relative to the prior year. We've been saying for quite some time now that these increases were going to moderate, and so we are pleased that our yield is still increasing year-over-year.  Turning next to the credit metrics on Slide 8. On the left, you can see that in the first quarter, the lending write-off rate was 2.3%, up 30 basis points to the prior year; and on the right, you can see that the charge write-off rate, excluding GCP, was 1.8%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. You also see on the page the delinquency and GCP net loss ratio trends. All of these portfolios are performing in line with our expectations, subject to typical seasonal trends and the fact that there is typically a bit more quarterly volatility in the charge rates. More broadly, as we said last quarter, we still do not see anything in our portfolio that would suggest a significant change in the credit environment.  With these metric trends, you can then see on Slide 9 that provision expense was $809 million in the first quarter, up just 4%. Now as you know, the accounting for provision is complex, and as an aside, is about to become much more complex under CECL. And I've often said that even today's complexity can drive some significant quarterly volatility at times. That quarterly volatility is certainly evident in the provision growth trend for the first quarter.  The low growth in the quarter is primarily due to the lower level of reserve builds this year versus last year. As you will remember, we saw higher reserve builds in the first quarter of last year driven by acceleration in loan growth and the seasoning of our lending book. In addition, we are lapping the impact of a modest increase in lending reserves in the first quarter of 2018 from the Hilton portfolio acquisition.  In contrast, given the relative stability we see in our lending portfolio today, we are not building reserves at the same level this quarter relative to a year ago. More broadly though, stepping back, as you think about the full year during our fourth quarter earnings call, we said we expected provision growth of less than 30% in 2019. Given the positive underlying trends we saw in the first quarter, we now expect to do somewhat better than this with provision growth in the mid-20% range for the full year.  Turning now to revenues on Slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the first quarter driven by broad-based growth across spend, lend and fee revenues. As I mentioned earlier, the FX impact to our growth rates in the first quarter was significant due to the year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies in which we operate beginning in the third quarter of last year. Assuming the dollar stays roughly where it is today, that effect should lessen as we go through 2019. For those of you interested, I would remind you that we share our exposure to top currencies in the appendix of the earnings slides that you see on our website today.  Moving to Slide 11, you see the components of our total revenue. The portion of our revenue coming from discount revenue and fees remained at 80% in the first quarter, in line with 2018. Discount revenue was up 5% on a reported basis and was up 7% on an FX-adjusted basis, which I'll come back to on the next slide. Net card fees grew 14% in the first quarter which is in line with the momentum we saw exiting 2018.  We feel very good about our ability to maintain strong growth in net card fees given the breadth of products that drive this momentum and the high engagement that we see with new and existing customers. As just one example, this quarter, we saw 67% of our consumer new account acquisitions come on fee-based products.  Net interest income grew at 12% in the first quarter, more in line with loan growth as our yield growth moderates. I would remind you that rising rates do represent a modest headwind for us given the size and scale of our charge business, and we have higher funding cost this year due to the rise in interest rates relative to last year. This impact of rising rates on our funding cost is being partially mitigated though by the great growth we are seeing in our online personal savings deposit program which has increased by 25% over the past year. As we have said, we continue to expect this to be the fastest-growing part of our funding stack. Stepping back, I would point out that unlike many other financial institutions, the latest interest rate outlook for the rest of the year represents a modest upside for us relative to what we saw as we put together our original outlook for 2019.  Turning now to Slide 12 to cover the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. As Steve and I continue to say going forward, our focus will continue to be on driving discount revenue growth, not the average discount rate. And on the right, you see that discount revenue grew 7% in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, roughly following our billing strength, making this the sixth consecutive quarter with discount revenue growth above 6%.  Turning now to our expenses on Slide 13. Let me first point you to operating expenses, which were up 10% in the quarter. There are a few discrete items impacting the growth rate, including the increase to legal reserves in the quarter this year and a charge related to the sale of our prepaid operations in the first quarter of last year. Excluding these items, we continue to have well-controlled operating expenses. Our ability to generate steady OpEx leverage continues to be a key part of our financial model and one that we have confidence in sustaining over the long term.  We continue to invest in our customer engagement cost which you can see on Slide 14 in which we're up 12% in the first quarter. Starting at the bottom with marketing and business development, I'll remind you that this line has 2 components: Our traditional marketing and promotion expenses; as well as payments we make to certain partners, primarily corporate clients, GNS partner banks and co-brand partners. Marketing and business development costs were up 17% in Q1. Last year, you saw a little bit of back-end loading in the spending we did around customer engagement, specifically in the marketing and business development line.  As I mentioned during our Investor Day in March, we expect in 2019 that our marketing spending will be more even across the 4 quarters. As a result, you see a little higher year-over-year growth rate in these costs in Q1. Just for clarity, I would also point out that when we announced the partnership extension with Delta, we said there was no impact to our Q1 results from the new agreement, and we'll come back to Delta at the end of my remarks.  Moving on to rewards expense. You can see that it was up 4% relative to the prior year. We would typically expect to see rewards expense grow roughly in line with proprietary billing. However, there were a few discrete impacts this quarter that drove somewhat lower growth.  Continuing on to Card Member services. We're up 34% in the first quarter. As we've said for some time, we expect this line to be our fastest-growing expense category as it includes many components of our differentiated value propositions which we believe are difficult for others to replicate, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the level of customer engagement we see with our premium benefits and services.  Turning to capital on Slide 15. Our CET1 ratio in the first quarter was 10.8%, near the top end of our 10% to 11% target range, and we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders. Over the course of the last 5 quarters, we have built our CET1 ratio back to the high end of our 10% to 11% target range after absorbing the impact of the Tax Act. This is a real testament to our high-ROE financial model. Going forward, I'd remind you that next quarter will be the last quarter of our 2018 CCAR share repurchase authorization of $3.4 billion. After that, we will continue to focus on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range.  In terms of capital usage going forward, you should expect us to continue our past philosophy. This means that you can expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings as it has historically. We will use a modest portion of our capital to continue to support our organic growth and for the occasional acquisition. And we'll return the remainder of our capital to our shareholders while remaining within the 10% to 11% CET1 target range. Since we are focused on staying in our 10% to 11% CET1 target range, you will see some quarterly variability in the amount of our share repurchases due to seasonality. But our longer-term commitment remains unchanged.  Now let's talk about things moving forward and then we'll open the call for your questions. As Steve mentioned, the 11-year extension of our strategic partnership with Delta marks another key milestone in our highly successful long-standing relationship. Today, it's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business with many years of growth above the company average. We look forward to many more years of this strong growth which generates attractive economics for both companies.  Although there was no impact to our Q1 '19 results from the contract renewal, we do expect an increase in the marketing and business development line of approximately $200 million over the balance of the year relative to our original outlook under the previous contract terms. As you would expect in today's competitive co-brand environment, there is some margin compression when these partnerships are renewed. However, this agreement will continue to generate attractive economics for us each and every year of its term. We are excited about the opportunity to continue to grow the partnership and drive ongoing benefits for our customers, our partner and our shareholder.  So that brings us to our outlook. We are affirming again our guidance for the year of having revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and having our adjusted earnings per share be between $7.85 and $8.35. During our earnings call in January and at Investor Day in March, we said that the lower end of the EPS range is there if there is some more significant economic slowdown relative to 2018. As we sit here in April, we see a stable, growing economy, albeit not quite at the levels of growth we saw in 2018. As a result, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our outlook for 2019.  One final point which relates to our Investor Relations team here at American Express. Steve and I have decided to move Edmund Reese to a critical new role within the company as the CFO of our largest and most critical segment, our Global Consumer business, working closely with Doug Buckminster, who you all know. I'd like to thank Edmund for leading the IR function during a period of strong performance for the company. On a personal note, I will miss the passion and relentless drive for creating value for our shareholders that Edmund has brought to the IR role. I'll look forward to seeing the great things he will no doubt accomplish with Doug in our Global Consumer business.  I'd also then like to welcome Rosie Perez, our new Head of Investor Relations effective immediately. Rosie was most recently the CFO of the Global Consumer Products and U.S. marketing business and has had a number of key finance positions over her 11 years with the company. I'm sure you will all benefit from Rosie's keen insights about our business as you get to know her.  With that, let me turn it back to Edmund one last time.\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Jeff. [Operator Instructions]. We will be ending the call a few minutes before 9:30 am prior to the market opening. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.\nCraig Maurer: First, congrats, Edmund, and congrats, Rosie. My question is about Delta. I was hoping you could sort of couch the comments that were made both by Delta and you guys today to help us understand how much of this new agreement relies on enhanced economics for Delta versus just what would be standard kind of improvements in the contract for Delta as the portfolio grew.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, let me start, Craig, by making a few financial comments then I'll let Steve comment a little more broadly. So we have had tremendous growth over the years with Delta. And in fact, if you were to look at the things we said at the time of the last renewal in 2014, you would see tremendous growth between the numbers that both we and Delta talked about in 2014 and today. And in fact, if you look at some of the numbers that Delta has publicly talked about over the last few weeks, and you run that forward, you basically see about the same growth rates.  So this has been a tremendous part of our business model for many years, faster growing than the company average. And what this agreement does is lock in both of our commitments to keeping this as one of the fastest-growing parts of our company for many years. And that's the key source of economics for both of these things. Now sure, when you renew these agreements, as we talked about in 2008 and 2014 and today, as we talked about with Hilton and Marriott last year, there is always some update to market terms. But we have a long track record of growing right through those modest updates to market terms and this is really about the partnership growing and driving value for both of us.\nStephen Squeri: Right. So let me just make a couple other comments. When you -- when Ed and I sort of met for the first time and started talking about our partnership, we realized just how critical this was to both companies. And when we got to November, what we both had said was let's put this sort of off the table for not only the foreseeable future but potentially forever, and that's why we decided to do this 11-year deal. And when you think about sort of that comment that I just made about forever, our intent is to invest side-by-side, our intent is to integrate from a technological perspective, to continue to integrate and leverage the huge amount of assets that we both have from a travel perspective, both business and personal travel, lounges, technological app integration, so forth and so on. And my view is, and I think Ed would say the same thing, we're going to grow this thing so big and we'll be in each other's DNA so much that come renewal time in January 1st of 2030, it will probably be much more of a formality to renew this versus any protracted negotiation. In 2030 I'm sure that there will be some economics that we'll talk about. Maybe it won't be Ed and I talking about them, but somebody will be talking about them. And we're really excited about it.  The other thing I'll point out, and Jeff mentioned this, we're going to have a $200 million headwind this year. And that happens when you do this. But I think what's really important here is that will be the last time you hear us talk about this. We'll have this $200 million headwind this year and we're going to just continue to grow. And I'll refer to my remarks where I said this is about billings growth, it's about lending growth, it's about revenue growth and it's about profitability growth. And so I think this is a great deal for us, I think it's a great deal for Delta, but probably most importantly, it's a great deal for our existing customers, both of them, as they're going to get a better product and we're going to avoid that sort of dance that you tend to do two years before the deal is up and we're going to invest right through this. And so avoiding that, I think, is probably the biggest win for both companies and for our customers.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: And congratulations to Edmund. Can you hear me?\nEdmund Reese: Thank you, Sanjay.\nStephen Squeri: Yes, Absolutely.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Sorry about that. Yes. Congratulations to Edmund and Rosie and congratulations on renewing Delta and thank you for not having us talk about it for the next 3 years. I guess I wanted to drill down on the spending volume stats that Jeff mentioned and sort of the fact that they were even through the quarter. Jeff, could you just talk about how we expect that to continue as we move through the year? Because there were certain onetime items in the quarter related to holidays and such and gas prices. I mean, does that rebound as we move forward? And then as we think about the FX optics, too, I think those subside as well, right?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, so let me work backwards. On FX, of course, we don't try to predict FX rates. My comments earlier were just pointing out that if you take today's rates and you assume that they were to stay for the rest of the year, then you would see naturally just given what happened last year, the FX impact moderate as you go through the year.  Look, we absolutely did see stable growth throughout the course of the first quarter, so we feel good that we are at a steady-state level consistent with the growth we see in the economy. In terms of -- when we net out all the various kinds of onetime items you talk about, I don't think there is anything that particularly drove the first quarter differently than what I'd expect to see in the rest of the year. So we feel good about the trends.  I think perhaps more importantly, Sanjay, on the revenue growth side, which is ultimately what this is all about, we were right in the middle of our guidance of 8% to 10% for the year and we feel great about that start and we are very confident in our ability to sustain the kind of strong revenue growth that you've heard us talk about as our key first goal in terms of driving sustainable share, scale and relevance. So we feel good about the trends.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: I actually wanted to follow up on Craig's question. I want to commend you on renewing Delta. I think most people will recognize it's a valuable partnership for both you and for them. And clearly, they were pretty happy with the outcome. They had mentioned a contribution from Amex by 2023 of $7 billion, up from $3.4 billion this year. And that implies, if you just kind of straight-line that over the period, about $5 billion in 2021 versus their prior disclosure of $4 billion. So I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much of that is them and you feeling like the new partnership is going to help you expand the pie? And how -- or how much of that is them just getting a larger share of that pie?\nJeffrey Campbell: So let me start, Mark, but just maybe level-setting everyone with some numbers. And while I don't always like to quote numbers from other people, if you go back to when we last renewed with Delta, they do talk about what they call the overall remuneration, which I would remind people are payments we make to Delta for lots of things that we then use in our value propositions, as we buy miles from them, as we pay for lounge access, as we pay for things like free baggage, et cetera. So in 2014, they talked about a $2 billion number. If you run that forward to the numbers they've been talking about for this year, you're at a compound annual growth rate in the mid-teens. And if you look at the numbers they talked about for the future, you're pretty much at about the same growth rate.  So this -- what we keep coming back to is this has been a great partnership where we have had very high rates of growth for some number of years. And with the 11-year deal now locked in so we're both comfortable continuing to invest, we're both very confident we can continue to grow at these kind of great rates. And that's the source of the economics. It's not particularly an inflection point from the path we have been on. You can also triangulate, if you like, on this by just looking at the numbers we provided at our Investor Days the last 2 years talking about the size of Delta relative to our overall billings and volumes. And again, if you just triangulate on those numbers, you're going to see growth rates all in the same kind of range.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to talk a little bit about the loan growth. I know we've already talked about spend and how that trajected throughout the quarter. I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the demand from your customers. And do you expect that there's an incremental upside to the loan growth as we go through the next couple of quarters here as the economy the markets obviously have done better? Or do you feel that at pace with recent trend is more likely? And then if you could speak a little bit about the international component versus the U.S. component as well. Like to understand if there's any incentives going on in the international side for spurring a little bit more loan growth.\nJeffrey Campbell: Maybe I'll start, Betsy, and Steve can add some business color. Look, we feel great about the now 5 years of growth that we've had a little bit above the industry. And as, Betsy, you've heard me say many times, we see that as color -- or driven by the unique opportunity that we have to correct our historical under-penetration of our own customers' borrowing behaviors. And we feel pretty great about 5 years of growing a little faster than the industry while growing our net interest yield and while maintaining best-in-class credit metrics.  All that said, I don't particularly see an inflection point in the environment. I think the rates that we're at, and I'd remind you, most of our lending is still driven by U.S. consumer, we feel good about those rates. I don't know that we're particularly looking to accelerate. And in fact, if you look at some of the things I said at Investor Day, I talked a little bit about some of the risk actions we've taken over the past year. We are seeing really good growth outside the U.S. as we have only more recently begun to focus a little bit on capturing a greater share of our customers' card borrowing behaviors outside the U.S., that's still a pretty modest portion of the total. So while the growth rates are good, it's still not a particularly large driver of the overall growth in the portfolio.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. I would just go back to what I said in my remarks and what I said at Investor Day. I think this sort of the loan growth and offering more loans to our customers really focuses on the whole concept the customer is a platform for growth. And so if you even look at sort of how we're treading, we're even trending now even up even more with loans to our existing customers. So we're up almost 60%. So if you look at the 12% loan growth that we had in our consumer business, 60% of that growth has come from existing customers. And we're going to continue that. I mean, we're going to continue to focus on the product and services that our customers need. There's no reason to cede that to the competition. And we're looking at obviously working capital. And we continue to grow loans internationally for our consumer business as well, but it's a very, very small part of our overall loan book. So not much change going forward. It's steady as she goes, staying on course, and obviously looking at all the guide rails as we go along and managing the credit quality as it comes in. And you even saw at Investor Day how our overall FICO score has gone up to 740, which we talked about. So we feel good about where we are.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: So as we start getting closer to the end of 2019, can you provide any updates on where you are relative to your U.S. coverage parity goal? And on that same topic, are there an incremental -- is there any incremental spending you think you'll have to make to drive yourselves over the finish line there?\nStephen Squeri: So boy, you're coming up on the end of 2019. But my grandfather used to say that July 4th, that the summer's over. But I guess for you, the whole year's over in April, huh? But anyway, look, we're still right on track. Virtual parity coverage by the end of 2019 in the U.S. We don't anticipate spending any more money than we already have in our plan or that we've -- or have been articulating. And so we feel really good about where that is. Now having said that, let me just explain what virtual parity coverage is. It doesn't mean that we might not find the restaurant here or the small retail shop there, but we're looking at sort of maybe triple 9s, five 9s, 99.99%, coverage here. And we feel really good about it. And when we find those places that just opened and may not accept the card, we'll jump right on it with our partners, which is -- the reason we feel so good about what we can do in international now, as I talked about at Investor Day, because of what we've done in the United States. And why we're taking a country focus and a city focus in international, is to really drive that coverage up using a lot of the same tools that we've used here in the U.S. to drive coverage. So bottom line, we feel good about it and we feel we're right on track.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Jeff, your comments about spending during Q1, some economists have talked a little bit about the fact that people who are kind of higher income but not wealthy might see unexpected kind of tax payments in April. Have you seen in the first couple of weeks any impact from that? Is that something we should be thinking about in Q2?\nJeffrey Campbell: That is a -- Moshe, I will say, common question we get. And as we look every year at spending patterns, it's really hard to see them impacted all by the timing around tax payments. And while I don't want to get too much into intra-quarter trends, it is April 18 and I certainly see no evidence of any kind of impact from people suddenly looking at what their ultimate tax due was and being surprised. So I think we feel good about the trends we saw in the first quarter. As I said earlier in response to Sanjay, we feel good about the sustainability of those trends. And in the grand scheme of things, I don't think that tax payments have much of an impact.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.\nBill Carcache: I wanted to follow up on your comments about the benefit you're generating from lower-cost funding sources with a broad branding strategy question. So we've seen some of your issuing bank partners start offering enhanced credit card rewards to customers who also maintain balances with them. Is there a possibility that we could see Amex do something similar with enhanced Membership Rewards for customers who exceed certain deposit thresholds?  And then separately but still on the topic of funding strategies, Amex in the past has concluded that debit products, that the offering didn't really make sense for you. But do you think there -- with the digitization that's taking place in the industry, could there -- could the debit offering perhaps become a bit more viable today than you thought in the past, particularly when you factor in the Durbin exemption that I believe you would qualify for?\nStephen Squeri: So let me take this. When -- as we think about sort of debit and we think about enhanced Membership Rewards, we constantly look at sort of the marketplace and the product offerings that we have to determine whether they're the right offerings or not. So you never say never as it relates to debit. I think the point that you bring up as it relates to debit is that with digitization, and I think there's no greater example of what you can do from a digital perspective than what we've done with personal savings and just the 25% growth that we've seen. So could you see a world or a day when you attach a debit to one of those products or attached debit to the Amex product? Possibly. But we're constantly looking. At it at this particular point in time, we don't really have any plans to do anything. We think the products and services that we have right now work just great.  As far as sort of linking products together from a rewards perspective, let me take it up one level. And we look at the totality of the value proposition. And the totality of the value proposition encompasses not only the Membership Rewards, but investments that you might make in lounge, in co-funding benefits with partners. And you can go through across our product line and see just the various components, whether it's restaurant credits or airline credits or Uber credits and so forth and so on. And so as we look at it, we try and see what our customers really truly value. And if there comes a point in time where it makes sense to take more rewards and give rewards to personal savings, we'll certainly look at that as we look at things all the time.  But right now, we like the value propositions that we have, and we continue to invest in those value propositions. And I'd just point out 2 of the acquisitions that we just made with LoungeBuddy here and with Pocket Concierge in Japan, which provides -- is going to provide more restaurant access. It's going to build upon the Cake acquisition and the Mezi acquisition that we did. And LoungeBuddy builds upon our entire lounge strategy. And we've just decided to make more investments in those areas at this point in time. But we certainly don't have our eyes closed. We really like to sort of manage this business with an external perspective. And if we find that, that becomes either an Achilles' heel or an opportunity, we'll take a look at it.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: Jeff, I know you wanted some comments on CECL, but I don't want to use up my question on CECL. If you want -- because that's going to be some complications. But I did notice that you guys, on the B2B side, adding Ariba, SAP Ariba, and you have Bill.com. And I was just wondering some updated thoughts on the growth of B2B payments. And I guess you're using SAP Ariba for enterprise and Bill.com for SMB would be my thought.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. As far as -- like I say, I don't know if it was the fourth quarter you asked the question or the third quarter, I talked about how we sort of think about this market in sort of 3s from a B2B perspective. You think about sort of the real small businesses, and that's exactly where Bill.com is focused as we look to integrate working capital and we look to integrate Card. Then you look at some of the AP Automation players, and we think about that in sort of the midsized companies and less-sophisticated maybe larger companies. And then you look at SAP Ariba and you look at sort of the integration there for large and global companies.  And what I would say about this sort of the SAP Ariba integration, the interesting part here for us is that what happens is the payment is completely integrated within the existing flow. But what's different is instead of just assigning a virtual account number, what we do is we assign the existing CPC card or the existing Corporate Card will spin off a virtual account number. So bottom line is the existing cardholders don't need to get new virtual card -- virtual account numbers, and that virtual payment sort of token that goes through will be tied back to their existing account. So there's no reissuance of cards and things like that. It's a seamless integration. And so if you have SAP Ariba, you have a Corporate Card, you're authorized to use it. You can put that in and it turns into a virtual payment. And it also provides some more control on the back-end because the supplier will not be able to continue to hit that card, it really becomes a onetime use for that transaction.  So we feel really good about that. We feel that like there's good reconciliation capabilities. We feel that what we've done with sort of tying our corporate and CPC products to the virtual account technology works out really well. And that, we feel, is really a value of having, again, the integrated business model that we have. So we're excited about it and it gives us an opportunity to go after that segment. And just to point out, obviously, we're in really good shape from an SME perspective. But 50% of our corporate -- large and global Corporate Card clients use SAP Ariba.\nJeffrey Campbell: And Bob, I will admit we were surprised at Investor Day as well that nobody asked about it. I'll very quickly say this. Obviously, it's super complex as I said earlier. It's a little baffling to us that it doesn't fit very well with credit card and yet seems like credit card may be most impacted by CECL, which I'm not sure is the original goal of the regulators.  Look, we have two things to think about. On the credit card side, our results aren't going be that dissimilar to others, although I don't see us at the high end maybe of what some others have said. What's unique for us just because of our charge card franchise, nobody else has that, and there actually reserves will go down. Now because our charge receivables are smaller than our lend receivables, on balance, I'd expect it to be a modest increase in reserves. For us, particularly from a capital perspective, I think this is manageable. But biggest challenge, I think, is going to be the volatility and complexity this is going to drive going forward as well as the pro-cyclicality. So there we go. CECL in 60 seconds. Next question.\nOperator: That will go to the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: I'd appreciate your updated thoughts on the average discount rate for this year. The discount rate was actually flat year-over-year in the first quarter for the first time in a while, and I'm curious what your thoughts are on discount rate, especially as we approach the rollout of PSD2 in Europe where consumer ACH payments might be widely used for e-commerce transactions. In that environment, does that change your value proposition, especially in Europe?\nStephen Squeri: So let me -- I was going to kick this to Jeff, but let me address the back part of this. I think actually, that's probably an opportunity for us. I don't think it's really going to change our discount rate. I think what it does is gives us an opportunity, like many other financial opportunities, to jump in to some of the debit potentially, some of the ACH transactions and some of the cash transactions which we don't really have access to today.  So if you had that under a discount rate model, yes, it would impact the discount rate. But this is why what I've been saying since day 1 is you have to look at the industry, you have to look at the country, you have to look at the economics of the overall transaction. And we have $1.2 trillion, $1.3 trillion of billings. If I put another $1.3 trillion on and it was at 50 basis points of what you would call \"discount rate\" and that was 50 basis points of profit and the discount rate was cut in half, who cares?  So reality is it's all about margin and it's all about making money, but the reality is when you get back to sort of PSD2, and I see it much more opportunity for us to grab more revenue and to grab more margin as we move forward. And I really don't look at that as impacting the discount rate. I certainly don't see it impacting the discount rate that we have on our traditional products with those existing merchants and that might be a new fee structure that we look at.  So -- and that's the reason why we haven't really been focused on the discount rate, right? Because as I've said before, this is what everybody has used as a proxy for the margin of the company and that's not really the way to look at it. And so we feel good about discount revenue growth and we're really going to continue to focus on discount revenue growth as we move forward.\nOperator: Our last question will come from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDonald Fandetti: If you look at U.S. small business, the spend volumes have continued to be pretty steady and good. As you think about Amazon and you dig further in terms the penetration opportunity, do you think that billed business growth rates could potentially improve? And then secondarily, as we think about U.S. consumer cards, the view seems to be that competition has stabilized. In small business in the U.S., are you seeing players get more active or more aggressive? Can you comment on that?\nStephen Squeri: Yes, look, I think in small business in the U.S., people have been very competitive for a long time. I just don't think it's been something that everybody has focused on. In a lot of banks, small business is buried within the consumer business. In fact, for us small business was buried within the consumer business until 2 to 3 years ago. So I see that as a very competitive space. Not -- maybe not as crazily competitive as U.S. consumer has been. So -- but look, I mean, has competition reached a plateau? We haven't seen the same step-ups, would say, that we've seen in the past. But look, even with Citi and some of the other banks, what they've done now, and Bank of America as well, is when you -- and Bill Carcache brought this up before, as you then tie sort of your deposits to your credit cards and put rewards on that, that's another form of competition. But we believe our value propositions play well.  So I think that when you think about the competition from a small business perspective, it's there. We feel that we have the assets of compete and have been competing very effectively and Amazon saw that same thing. The last point I'll make from a small business growth perspective, we have a very large base from a small business perspective, and small businesses go in and out. And so what you're seeing in that growth rate is not only all the new signings that we get, which is a pretty good number, but also businesses that close and so forth. So we'll continue to push with products and services and hopefully to continue the growth rate that we've seen over the last 3, 4, 5 years in the U.S.\nEdmund Reese: With that, we'll bring the call to an end.

Welcome to the American Express Q4 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please go ahead.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s call. As a reminder, before we begin, today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future business and financial performance. These are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today\u2019s presentation slides, in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter\u2019s earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company\u2019s progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Vivian. Good morning and belated Happy New Year to everyone and hope you and your families are healthy and safe. As you saw, we earned $1.76 per share or $9.35 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. And while we\u2019re still seeing the impacts of the COVID pandemic on our business, the trends have steadily improved as the year went on. At the beginning of the pandemic, we had little visibility into the future, but we did have a plan for managing the company through this period of uncertainty focusing on four priorities; supporting our colleagues, protecting our customers and our brands, remaining financially strong, and at the same time taking steps to structure our company for longer-term growth. We\u2019ve made substantial progress against each of these priorities. As I talked about last quarter, we see this cycle playing out in three phases. Phase 1 has been about managing through the peak of the uncertainty, which is what we focused on for most of 2020. We are now solidly in phase 2, which is about investing to rebuild our growth momentum. Our goal in phase 2 is to prepare us for phase 3, a return to pre-COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm. Our progress in managing through phase 1 confirms the strength and resilience of our differentiated business model. Key elements of this model, such as the diversity and scale of our customer base, our brand, our global merchant network, and our integrated payments platform have given us a solid foundation to build on as we move into the next phase. As we\u2019ve seen throughout this period, our customers have been resilient and adaptive since the lows in mid April, overall Card Member spending has steadily improved. Our Card Members quickly adapted to the current environment with an acceleration in their shift to online and card-not-present spending. Non-T&E spending recovered to pre-COVID levels in Q3 and continued to grow throughout the holiday season in Q4. Consumer holiday spending was up 11% globally year-over-year, exhibiting particularly strong online growth of 40%. In addition, our value propositions and brand continue to resonate with our customers. Attrition rates in our proprietary products remain lower than last year and our customer satisfaction levels remain above pre-COVID levels. We again ranked number one in J.D. Power\u2019s Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers for the 10th time in the 14 years the study has been conducted. Throughout the year, our merchant network continued to grow globally. We sustained virtual parity coverage in the United States and we added more than 3.7 million merchant locations internationally in 2020. Credit performance continued to be outstanding, thanks to our robust underwriting and risk management capabilities, and the quick adjustments we\u2019ve made as the pandemic hit. Our Q4 delinquencies and write-offs are at some of the lowest levels we\u2019ve seen in a few years and are best-in-class. Our business model has also helped to further strengthen our already strong capital and liquidity position over this period. And our colleagues have proven to be even more agile and highly engaged in moving the company forward. Despite dealing with disruptions of the pandemic that which was brought to there \u2013 which has been brought to their lives at work and at home. All in all, I feel good about all that we accomplished in 2020 and some of the highlights of which you can see on Slide 2. I am even more confident that our strategy is the right one to position us for growth going forward. That being said, the effects of the pandemic will continue to linger in the short-term. The pace of economic recovery is dependent on the course of the virus and the speed with which vaccines can be distributed. For us, the timing of how quickly we can get to phase 3 and return to pre-pandemic levels of earnings is also tied to recovery in consumer travel and entertainment spending, and therefore dependent on how soon lockdowns ease, travel restrictions lift, and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again. We continue to be confident that consumer spending on travel and entertainment will come back to pre-COVID levels. We just can\u2019t predict right now how quickly. Given this environment, we are looking at 2021 as a transition year during which our focus will be on building \u2013 rebuilding growth momentum. By rebuilding growth momentum, we mean firing up our core acquisition and retention engines, scaling key next horizon opportunities, and retaining the flexibility in our financial model. To accomplish this, we plan to aggressively increase investments in our core strategic business areas with a specific focus on the following. In our consumer and commercial businesses, we plan to continue to ramp up our Card Member acquisition activities, inject additional value into targeted products, and continue our strategy of periodic refreshes of our premium products. Additionally, in our commercial business, we plan to continue to invest in scaling our cash flow and supplier payment solutions beyond the card. A few examples of how we\u2019re doing this includes the work already under way to integrate and re-launch Kabbage\u2019s suite of products, including a digital business checking account for small businesses as well as continuing our efforts to expand the penetration of our AP automation solutions, where we have seen volumes double in the last year alone. On the network side, we plan to continue our focus on increasing coverage as well as improving perceptions of coverage and welcome acceptance globally. We\u2019re also investing in enhancements into our network to deliver value to our various partners and to support the growth of debit capabilities in China. Finally, we plan to continue investing heavily in new and expanded digital capabilities across our businesses. The nature of the pandemic has accelerated customer engagement with many of our digital features, services, and experiences we rolled out in 2020 and over the past several years, and we think these trends are here to stay. At a high level, those are the key areas where we plan to increase investments this year to generate the momentum that will help carry us through the recovery and into the future. Before I hand the call over to Jeff, let me end with a few words about how we're thinking about our financial performance in 2021 and beyond. On our last quarter\u2019s earnings call, I talked about how my confidence in the long-term was growing, though the near-term remains harder to predict. Today, I'm even more confident about our growth potential in the medium and long-term, but I'm still cautious about predicting the precise pace of the recovery in 2021. As I discussed, our plan for this year calls for maximizing investments in those areas that enable us to rebuild growth momentum. With this in mind, we will not be focused on a particular EPS target in 2021. Though, Jeff will provide you with some scenarios of potential outcomes in a few minutes. In reflecting on COVID impact on the economy and our business in 2020 and where we are as begin 2021. We look at this two-year period as a pause in the growth momentum we had, had been generating for the previous 10 consecutive quarters before the pandemic began. As a result, we will be focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022. And for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm going forward. I believe we have the right plan for achieving this aspiration. The foundation of our business is solid. Our brand, customer relationships and partnerships are strong. Our colleagues are focused and committed, and we have shown that we can adapt to rapidly changing conditions. I'll now hand the call over to Jeff to review our financial results. And then we'll take your questions after that. Thank you for your time.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter results in the context of what was clearly an unprecedented full year 2020. I'll also provide you a sense of how we're thinking about the future with some scenarios, potential outcomes for 2021. Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. Our results in the fourth quarter continue to improve sequentially, but we're still significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend, lend and other travel related revenues. While card fee revenues continued to grow. Net income was $1.4 billion and earnings per share was a $1.76 in the fourth quarter down 13% from a year ago. Now, as I've said over the past three quarters, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends. So I'll again, spend the most time on these two topics. Turning to the details of our volumes, first, let's start with build business, which you will see several views of on Slides 4 through 10. The rapid pace of change in billings has slowed since September. And so we have returned to showing quarterly trends in our build business slide, since we think looking at trends on a quarterly basis is more meaningful, due the noise you see in monthly trends from days mix and the timing of holidays. Starting with Slide 4, overall build business declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our proprietary build business, which makes up 86% of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was down at same 16%. And the remaining 14% of our overall billings, which comes from our network business, GNS was down 15% in the fourth quarter, all on an FX adjusted basis. When you look at our build business performance in 2020, and think about what this might mean for 2021, it's important to think about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately, given the very different impacts, the pandemic has had on these volume trends. As you can see on Slide 5 non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes hit or trough in the second quarter, but was back above pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter and grew 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as our Card Members, particularly consumers and SMEs have adapted their spending behaviors to the current environment. T&E spending on the other hand has remained down much more significantly declining 65% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. So it did show some continued modest, sequential improvement driven primarily by consumers. As a reminder, prior to the pandemic non-T&E spending was around 70% of our proprietary build business. And today it represents almost 90% as you can see on Slide 6. Looking at the billings mixed by customer type at the bottom of the slide, you see that the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our consumer business and that is even more true today. Taking a closer look at T&E on Slide 7, you see the consumer chain continued to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations. We expect this trend to continue given the pent-up demand for travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectations the corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time. We also continue to see different paces of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines, but both showed modest improvement sequential in Q4. Restaurant spending, on the other hand has been the most resilient throughout, decelerated slightly during Q4 due to colder weather in the U.S., and renewed dining restrictions in certain geographies. Moving on to global consumer on Slide 8, we continue to see an acceleration in online and card-not-present spend growth throughout 2020, especially during the holiday season, which drove 5% growth in non-T&E spending in the fourth quarter. Turning next to our global commercial build business on Slide 9, non-T&E spending has returned and to pre-COVID levels and grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Within our commercial segment, we continue to see a tale of two very different customer types spending from small and medium-sized enterprise customers, who historically have the highest mix of non-T&E spending has been the most resilient throughout 2020. Whereas large and global corporate spending, which historically has been primarily T&E has been down the most during the pandemic. I will remind you here that spending from our SME customers now represents 86% of our commercial build business. You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend, when you look at our international regions on Slide 10, which have more travel related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern, which speaks to the global impact of this pandemic. To sum up on volumes, we feel good about the pace of recovery in non-T&E spending throughout 2020 and expect it will continue to grow steadily in 2021. But more broadly in 2021, our overall volume recovery to pre pandemic levels will be primarily driven by what happens with T&E, since non-T&E has already substantially recovered, while we currently expect spending Q1 2021 to remain relatively in line with Q4 of 2020 upside of some impact from normal seasonality, our current assumption is that by Q4 of 2021 T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of Q4 2019 levels. Moving next to loans and receivables on Slide 11. Loan and receivable balances were up 4% and 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, driven by higher spending volumes during the holidays. However, loan and receivable volumes were down 17% and 24% year-over-year respectively in the fourth quarter, driven by the continued declines in spending volumes that I just spoke. We also continue to see higher pay down rates from revolving Card Members on our credit cards. Looking forward into 2021, I would expect the recovery and loan balances to lag the recovery and spending volumes, if the higher paydown rate trends we saw in 2020 continue. In addition, I\u2019d remind you that we typically see a modest sequential decline in balances in the first quarter of every year, due to seasonal spending patterns. Turning next to our traditional credit metrics on Slide 12, you will see that the credit trends in the fourth quarter remained remarkably strong with Card Member loans and receivable write-off dollars, excluding GCP down 30% and 59% year-over-year respectively. In addition, our write-off in delinquency rates continued to be down year-over-year and down sequentially in the fourth quarter, reaching the lowest quarterly loss rates we\u2019ve seen in several years for both Card Member loans and receivables. Looking at the total balance of loans and receivables that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 13, those balances continued to decline sequentially to $4 billion at the end of Q4 and now stand $1.2 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. Historically, the credit outcomes of Card Members that are enrolled in these programs are better than delinquent Card Members that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience. It is unusual to see credit performance this strong in an environment like this. It all starts with the changes we\u2019ve made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which give us a solid or gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we had the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance. Of course like others, our customers are also helped by external factors, such as record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery and that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves. Moving on to Slide 14, you will see that the macro economic assumptions that were used in the modelling of CECL reserves for the expected lifetime losses of the loans and receivables have modestly improved in both the baseline and downside scenarios since Q3, but the two scenarios do remain sharply divergent. In our reserve calculations for the fourth quarter, we continued to weigh heavily towards the more pessimistic downside scenario due to the continued caution that I just spoke about. Despite this caution, the impact of this modest improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models and our strong credit performance led us to release $674 million of reserves in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 15. This reserve release coupled with our low write-offs drove a provision expense benefit of $111 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with $5.8 billion of reserves representing 7.3% of our loan balances, 0.6% of our Card Member receivables balances respectively and we believe that the reserves on our balance sheet, which are up $1.5 billion from the pre-pandemic levels are appropriate giving the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery. Turning now to the details of our revenue performance on Slide 16. Fourth quarter revenues were down 18% year-over-year, driven by declines in spend, lend and other travel-related revenues while net card fees continued to grow as you can see on Slide 17. Net card fee growth remained strong throughout 2020 and grew 12% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued Card Member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis in the second quarter. Although we started to ramp up new card acquisition in the third and fourth quarter and we\u2019ll continue to increase investments in this area this year, it will take time for card fee growth to reaccelerate. As a result, I do expect card fee growth to dip into the single digits midway through this year before it starts to eventually reaccelerate. Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on Slide 18, net interest income declined 17% on an FX adjusted basis, roughly in line with the loan declines we saw in the fourth quarter. Net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 10 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by modest tailwinds from funding costs and pricing for risk, mostly offset by declines in revolving loan balances. Looking forward, I\u2019d expect net interest income to be relatively flat to Q4 in the first quarter and then increase modestly as loan volumes recover. Turning next to our largest component of revenue, discount revenue on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This difference drove in 11 basis points decline and the average discount rate in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year since as a reminder we on average earned higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. The discount rate was also down modestly sequentially due to the seasonal trend we typically see in the fourth quarter. Looking forward into 2021, I\u2019d expect discount revenue to recover generally in line with billed business with the discount rate trends impacted by the pace of T&E recovery. Coming back to total revenues on Slide 20, you see that the overall revenue trends in 2020 have broadly moved in line with billed business trends, given the spend centric nature of our business model. While I would expect first quarter 2021 revenues to be broadly in line with Q4 outside of some impact from seasonality, if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4 as I mentioned earlier, you probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you would see full year revenue growth that somewhat lower or higher than that 9% to 10%. Moving on to Slide 21, we\u2019re continuing to breakout our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which moved naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 24% for the full year driven by lower spending and lower usage of travel related benefits. The year-over-year declines in variable customer engagement expenses provided around a 50% offset to the full year revenue declines we saw in 2020. In the fourth quarter that offset was close to 40% as we began to see some higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits and I would expect that relationship to continue into the first quarter of 2021. Moving onto the marketing expense line, we invested $1 billion in the fourth quarter as we ramped up our investments in new card acquisition and continued to invest in value injection. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we could spend as much as a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this year. Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see as we move throughout the year and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts as customers begin to experience again the full benefits of our existing value propositions. Turning to operating expenses, you can see that they were down 6% year-over-year in 2020 as we kept tight control over our expense base while selectively investing in areas critical for our long-term strategies. In 2021, we expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion below 2019 levels as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to rebuild growth momentum. Last, while you saw some quarterly volatility this year on our effective tax rate, the final fourth quarter tax rate was a bit below 23%, and I\u2019d expect around a 23% effective tax rate in 2021, absent any legislative changes. Turning next to capital and liquidity on Slide 22, our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have been all year. Our CET1 ratio ended the year at 13.5% after hitting in the third quarter our highest level, since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the year at $54.6 billion and has been a record high since the start of the pandemic due to our distinctly countercyclical balance sheet. We remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. We plan to resume share repurchases starting this quarter up to our maximum that authorized capacity of around $440 million in Q1. Beyond Q1, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed\u2019s guidelines, our capital generation and the growth in our balance sheet. To sum up, we feel good about how we\u2019ve navigated through the unprecedented challenges of 2020 and we feel well-positioned to rebuild our growth momentum in 2021. We now know a lot about how our customers and our business are performing in this environment. The two areas that do remain harder to predict for 2021 though are the same two we have talked about since the pandemic began, the ultimate credit outcomes and the pace of the recovery in T&E spending, as I mentioned earlier. That said the range of potential outcomes on credit and reserves is the most impactful to our performance in 2021. And so on Slide 23, we have outlined two scenarios. Most importantly, Scenario 1 assumes that the caution we have shown in our Q4 credit reserves about the potential for a significant downturn to the pace of economic recovery turns out to be warranted. Such an economic outlook would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4 and this would likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $5. Scenario 2 most importantly assumes that we do not see a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery leading us to continued strong credit performance and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery. The combination of these factors could lead us to a much stronger EPS outcome in the area of $7. In either scenario, our investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that help us to rebuild growth momentum along with the trajectory of our value injection efforts, not by focusing on a specific EPS outcome. We run the company to maximize value for our shareholders in the long-term. Although we can\u2019t predict precisely where 2021 EPS will land or provide an EPS guidance range at this time, we believe that our focus on managing the company to rebuild growth momentum is the right one to help us achieve our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we have for 2020 and 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate...\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Sanjay.\nSanjay Sakhrani: How are you? I appreciate all the context for 2021 and 2022, because I know it\u2019s pretty fluid. But I guess as we think about the assumptions you\u2019ve outlined, how confident are you on the 70% T&E rebound in the fourth quarter of 2021? I mean, do you need a broad scale reopening or do you think just naturally the behaviors will be better this year versus last year when we were in shock kind of post-COVID? And then I\u2019m just wondering how much of an uptake are you assuming from the new customer acquisitions that started last quarter, could that be additive to your guidance? And then last one on the assumptions, just the reserve releases, like how much of that are you assuming in your $7 number in this year versus 2022? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Well, we\u2019ll try those three questions.\nSanjay Sakhrani: It\u2019s all around one beam.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. Yes. Well, the first thing I will say is there was no real guidance. I mean, we gave sort of some scenarios, but let\u2019s talk about the first part of the string here, and then I think Jeff can jump in at the end with the releases. But we\u2019re in a completely different spot than we were sort of last year. I mean, when we were talking last year at any given point in time, we didn\u2019t have a vaccine. And so, while the vaccine right now is \u2013 what I would call it fits and starts, I mean, is there enough \u2013 at the beginning there wasn\u2019t enough places to sort of \u2013 to do vaccine distribution. Now, we have vaccine distribution points, but you don\u2019t have enough vaccine to distribute, hard to get appointments, so there\u2019s a lot of disconnect, that will sort itself out. And it\u2019ll sort itself out over a period of a couple of months, not over a couple of years. And so, we believe that by June or so, you will either have sort of herd immunity or a perceived herd immunity. The other thing that we believe is that there is a huge pent-up demand for travel. I guess probably \u2013 and nobody on this call that doesn\u2019t want to travel or go someplace or don\u2019t know their friends or family that want to do the same thing. And so, when we look at it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a widespread international travel, but you will see domestic travel and domestic travel being \u2013 domestic travel here in the United States, domestic travel sort of within the European Union, things like that. You\u2019re probably not going to see a lot of long haul this year. And so look, I\u2019m fairly confident that we will see the predictions that we have come through as it relates to travel. I mean, we\u2019re talking about consumer travel potentially being back about 80% would overall travel being back about 70%, business travel will come back a little bit slower, but I\u2019d be shocked if we\u2019re sitting here at this time next year and we say, geez, you know what we really missed it on travel. I just don\u2019t see that happening. I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines, but again these vaccines are going to take some time to get into the marketplace. I mean, what do you have, like 20 million people in the United States at this point sort of vaccinated or something like that, and it\u2019s only January. And so, I believe that as we get into this summer season, these June, July, August, and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel. I think cruise lines you know that\u2019s more of a 2022 phenomenon. So, we feel, really good about consumer \u2013 consumer travel coming back. I think, our airline partner with Delta, Ed said the same thing on his earnings call. So, we feel real confident about that. And as far as new cards, I mean, look, new cards take a while to get back to get into the mix, but what we have booked in our sort of our own internal forecast, not the scenarios is that the cards that we booked last year will behave probably slightly slower than normal cards would behave just because you\u2019re not going to have those Card Members traveling right out of the gate, they\u2019ll probably be more of a second half phenomenon. And so, their spending may ramp a little bit slower than normal. Having said that, we are really focused on getting \u2013 we don\u2019t talk a lot about cards, but cards lead to build business acquired, which we do talk a lot about. We are really focused on ramping up our acquisition engine, and we believe there are a lot of good cards \u2013 a lot of good opportunities out there for us to acquire cards.\nJeff Campbell: Sanjay, I\u2019ll add two things on cards and then talk about reserves. I would point out on cards we were really pleased in the fourth quarter to see in the U.S. consumer business, our Platinum and Gold new Card Member acquisition numbers were essentially at 2019 levels. That\u2019s a really good sign to us. The other point I\u2019d make is just to reiterate what Steve said, is that it\u2019s really a 2022 impact to a great extent. 2021 is about rebuilding new card acquisition numbers. It won\u2019t affect the 2021 results that much, because the 2021 results then to go to your last question are all about what happens, its credit. And I guess I\u2019d encourage everyone to think about two numbers. So, I cited in my script that relative to the beginning of the year, we now end the year with $1.5 billion more in credit reserves. We also, relative to the beginning of the year, ended the year with $1.2 billion more in delinquent accounts and accounts in our financial relief programs. And yet, I also pointed out that historically 80% of the dollars that go into our financial relief programs, we end up collecting and doing fine with. So, what that should tell you is that our credit reserves assume a very conservative economic outlook. And so, you have to see more bad stuff happen in the economy, small businesses going bankrupt, lots of consumers being laid off. You have to expect more bad things like that to happen for all of those reserves to be needed. So, we\u2019re not making an economic call, Sanjay. We\u2019re saying, well, if all that bad stuff happens, like in the real downside scenario of our economic forecast, then we\u2019re going to need all those reserves we have on the books, and you\u2019re probably \u2013 that sort of where the low scenario comes from. Conversely, if Wall Rocky, there is a fairly steady recovery, we have a lot of excess reserves that you probably are going to release, and that sort of leads you towards the high scenario. So, we\u2019ll have to see, but either way our focus remains rebuilding growth momentum this year, because it\u2019s all about 2022.\nOperator: For our next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. So, this question I had was around your proprietary card acquisition trends, which you put in the deck, and I just wanted to get an understanding as to which programs are you seeing drive this kind of\u2026\nSteve Squeri: Betsy? Operator?\nOperator: Ms. Graseck, your line is still open. Please check your mute feature.\nJeff Campbell: Well, should we just go ahead and answer what we think Betsy was in the middle of asking Steve for our new card acquisition?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. And I think Jeff just really answered it. I mean, when we look at new card acquisition, our platinum and our gold levels are, we\u2019re at levels of 2019. And so we feel really good about that. I think our cash back cards were actually doing quite well as well. What we have not seen and this makes all the sense in the world is our co-brand, our co-brand acquisition. And our co-brand acquisition, I mean, look, the reason you do co-brand cards, you do that to combine value propositions between us and our partners, but you also get tremendous distribution. And right now, not a lot of people stay in hotels, not a lot of people taking flights, so you lose those distribution opportunities. Having said that, what our co-brand cards though are performing either in the United States or in other markets at or better than our proprietary cards from a spending perspective, because as I\u2019ve said, all along people spend to gather those points to take that \u2013 to take those trips because they have such a pent-up demand for travel. And our retention numbers on our co-brand cards are at the same levels they were in 2019. So, we feel good about proprietary acquisition, which again is being driven by platinum and gold and some cash back. Our co-brand acquisition is not as ramped up because we depend on our \u2013 the co-brand channels. But having said that, our co-brand performance is really, really good and Ed made that comment, Ed Bastian made that comment in his earnings remarks as well. So, hopefully, Betsy, we provided a little bit of somewhere around the answer \u2013 quite answered the question you were trying to ask before you got cut off.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. I had some questions about the scenarios. Just clarifying the 2021 scenario, the Scenario 2, essentially, Jeff, all the things you kind of outlined for your expectations such as the 70% rebound in T&E spend in the 8% - or 9% to 10% revenue growth and everything from marketing and OpEx as well as benign credit. And then second part of that is just 2022 aspiration, kind of what do you guys need to see to get there?\nJeff Campbell: Well, maybe I\u2019ll take the first part, Steve and you should take the second. So on 2021 Mark, I guess the point is the overwhelming driver of a low scenario or a high scenario are what happens or is going to be what happens with credit, as I said a few minutes ago. Now sure, if credit turns out to be really strong, your revenue is going to be a little on the strong side and vice versa. But what we\u2019re trying to do, if you go throughout my remarks just give you a very clear sense of how we\u2019re going to manage the company this year. And that\u2019s why I told you we\u2019re going to manage OpEx too and what we might spend on marketing. And we\u2019re going to do those things because we\u2019re all about rebuilding growth momentum this year, the ultimate credit outcome and just how quickly discount revenues come back is going to be driven by the external environment. And that\u2019s why you have a low and a high scenario, but it really is not going to impact how we run the company this year, which of those two scenarios comes out. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to communicate by calling these scenarios as opposed to a guidance range. And then Steve, maybe you want to talk about 2022?\nSteve Squeri: I think 2020 two top-line assumptions, you have a consumer T&E fully recovered and you have a reasonably healthy economy in 2022. So we\u2019re not expecting corporate travel to come back. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a driver of it. And so if you have that as your baseline, then I think we\u2019re right within where we want to be. And the key thing that we need to do is, and we\u2019ve said this as we went through both our remarks, our investment levels will be higher than they\u2019ve ever been. That\u2019s our plan. We are planning for what do we have and we have light to \u2013 we see light at the end of the tunnel in terms of investment opportunities, we will continue to invest and take advantage of all those investment opportunities that are available to us. If they\u2019re not there, we\u2019ll pull back. But we believe they will be there. We will look to ramp up our Card acquisition. We will look at value injection early on in the year. We\u2019ll look at value proposition refreshes throughout the year. We\u2019re going to focus on welcome acceptance and keeping parity coverage in the United States. We\u2019re going to drive really hard at international acceptance. I mean, look, we signed 3.7 million merchants internationally last year, not including China, take China off the table for a second. We\u2019re going to drive international acceptance, as we\u2019ve said. We\u2019re going to continue to work and invest in our network, we\u2019re going to launch Kabbage in our small business checking account and get more primacy with our small business customers. And we\u2019re going to get some traction in China as well. So, we are really focused in 2021 in investing across all dimensions of our \u2013 each one of our business lines and preparing ourselves for 2022, by building that strong foundation of retaining Card Members, acquiring new ones and building merchant network and continuing to build up network capabilities and digital capabilities. We believe with the healthy economy and T&E consumer spending, just about fully recovered will be within our range.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead.\nRick Shane: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I\u2019d like to start with a question about non-marketing, non-rewards expense. In Q4, that was literally the only line item that was comparable to 2019 levels. I\u2019m curious if you think that there\u2019s going to be better opportunity for operating leverage on that metric and what sort of drove the normal rate there versus everything else we saw in the business?\nJeff Campbell: Well, let me \u2013 Rick, take it up one level and then come back if you don\u2019t think this is responsive. I mean, what we are focused on overall is managing the operating expenses of the company, which is everything other than the variable customer engagement costs and marketing. And we have a very clear plan in 2021 to manage those to about $11.5 billion that is below 2019 levels. If we\u2019re to look at some businesses we\u2019ve sold over the years, it\u2019s frankly about where the number was a decade ago in 2012 and 2013. So we think we have a very long track record of being very disciplined about managing what I think of as the infrastructure costs of the company, which means that as revenues and billings recover and grow, there\u2019s tremendous leverage from holding that a little below 2019 level. There\u2019s always a little bit of quarterly noise, particularly the Q4 some of the lines in OpEx you\u2019ll see every year, if you go back and look at history, go up a little bit. But that\u2019s the disciplined approach that we\u2019re taking here. So I don\u2019t know if I got to the number of your question, Rick, but that\u2019s probably how we think about it.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. The other thing I would add is that, if you look at this number on the face of it, it\u2019s pretty much the same number we\u2019ve had in 2012 from an operating expense perspective. But yet the business is very different than it was in 2012. We\u2019re focused on different things. We\u2019ve acquired a bunch of companies, which are in here and our focus has been completely different. So I think, the team has done a really good job of on an ongoing basis taking expense out and then putting in investment back in. And so, as you think about this, what you need to do is constantly look at this operating base and when we look at it, that\u2019s providing us leverage. So if we think about the core business that we had, we\u2019re getting enough leverage out that to fund other opportunities within the business, whether that be Kabbage, whether that be the acquisition of a Mezi or a Resy or a LoungeBuddy so forth and so on. And yet you go back 10 years, we\u2019re at the same place. And so we believe, when we look it as managers of the business, we\u2019re getting tremendous operating leverage because we\u2019re able to add these things on without layering on a lot of operating costs. And that\u2019s how we look at it.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So maybe a two-part question. So Steve, you noted in your color that for 2022, you expect T&E to be \u2013 on the consumer side to be fully recovered and a healthy economy. So maybe first, can you maybe just talk about what some of the drivers would be in terms of the shortfall from lower corporate travel and then potentially higher spending, you outlined the OpEx and marking this year could be $4.5 billion. Will there be a pullback in spending? Or could we see revenues accelerating as Card Member growth picks up? And then secondly, you talked earlier in your remarks about attrition being below pre-COVID levels. We\u2019re in this kind of weird transition period right here where consumers have pent-up demand like myself, but can\u2019t leverage anything in the near-term. So can you maybe just expand on the comments about injecting greater value in and how you\u2019re thinking about product refreshes? And does the pandemic at all change the way you approach refreshes in terms of what\u2019s included in the value proposition? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So I think, let\u2019s talk about the second one first, and if I remember the first question, I\u2019ll come back to it. It seems like a couple of minutes ago, just teasing you Ryan. But when we look at sort of value injection, I think because people couldn\u2019t travel, what we tried to do was to do two things, to not only provide them value in the short-term, but to sort of shift their mindset on how they use the card. And so when you look at what we did with platinum and with open-platinum and centurion, by putting in things like streaming credits and wireless credits and some shipping credits, we had 78% of our U.S. platinum Card Members take advantage of those \u2013 of that value injection. We had about 50% of our small business customers take advantage of that. But the really interesting point in consumer platinum, 17% of our base was not putting wireless on their card. They are now. So we had a uptick of 17%. Now this is something that any of you who have embedded your card in a payment stream to try and get it out is very difficult. Recurring billing is probably the stickiest thing you have. And so for the first time, 17% of our platinum card base actually put wireless on the card, which is, you might think surprising, but people put spending in compartments. And 10% put streaming on the card. So the value injection is meant for us to do two things. Number one, steer people where we want them to go, and number two, provide real value to them. And we did that. And I think that that has really helped us from a retention perspective because obviously people want \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to do that and then we\u2019ll look at our overall value propositions just as we\u2019ve had over the course of the last three years and continue to refresh those. And I think you\u2019ll see those refreshed and we\u2019ll expand the aperture of that. So you will expand beyond traditional T&E value proposition enhancements. We\u2019ll look at other T&E value proposition enhancements because safety and traveling will become even more important I think to our premium card holders and we\u2019ll work with our partners. A lot of the value we put in is either co-funded or merchant funded, and we\u2019ll continue to work with our partners to do that. So we have \u2013 we feel really good about the retention that we saw, and we feel really good about the value injection, because it\u2019s a behavioral shifts that it drove, and we believe that that will be sticky, which is why you see an increase in our non-T&E spending on a sequential basis. And we believe that will continue. So that\u2019s the first part. As far as the second part of the question, look, we do believe that the first question was, we believe that consumer travel will be back because it is the pent-up demand. I see the vaccines working, we see herd immunity coming, and we certainly see that happening by the fourth quarter. If God forbid the vaccines, the efficacy proves it doesn't work, we got a whole different issue for the entire economy, and we're not talking about American Express traveling, we're talking about different things at this particular point. But all indications on vaccine will work. It will be distributed and off will go. As far as corporate spending, look, our corporate card business, which is near and dear to all of us, drives about 9% of our overall billings and about 60% of that is T&E. There are companies that are still traveling and the T&E piece of corporate spending is across multiple disciplines. It's across lodging, it's across restaurants, it's across car rental and it's across air as well. And so we have pharmaceutical sales reps they travel by car, they stay in hotels and they spend for food. That's still going on, where you see not a lot of T&E spending as consultants who cannot go actually to their clients. But when you think about industrials and manufacturing, that is still going on. And you think about local salespeople that still need to get out to some of their accounts. But having said that, we don't anticipate that coming back, but we don't believe that's a big driver of our overall profitability. As we've said, it's not a big driver of our revenue that 9% billings does not equate to either 9% revenue or 9% profitability and we believe that what we will gain from a consumer and our small business perspective will more than make up for any shortfall that would occur in our corporate card business.\nJeff Campbell: And I'd just add two other things, Ryan, sort of the other leg of the stool is small business, where travel just isn't that big a piece of their spending. And those small businesses are already going strong and we just need them to continue the steady recovery. The other thing, I just want to clarify for everyone is reminding you that, when we went into 2020, 12 months ago on a January call, seems like years ago, we gave you guidance for 2020 of $8.85 to $9.25. And that's the kind of targets that we're aspiring to achieve in 2022.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\nChris Donat: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the merchant discount rate, Jeff, you said that it would depend on the T&E spending. I'm just wondering where we are taking a longer-term view on OptBlue and some of the downward pressure you'd seen on the MDR in recent years. Are we basically through that and can we expect maybe the more likely scenarios that you see an increase in MDRs, you see more T&E spend, or is there any downside risk to the\u2026?\nJeff Campbell: So two things, we're completely through any downward pressure from OptBlue. That's in the rear view mirror. And obviously, if you look at what's happened at discount rate, discount rate has been driven down by mix. And it's like, I've always said, I always focus on discount rate by industry and mix overall, because if you look at sort of where we are right now is 2.25% or \u2013 I think that that's where we are right now is 2.25%, is, oh my god, you were at 2.25%, but you're at 2.25% with 65% T&E decline. And so as T&E comes back that MDR will move back up. But OptBlue will not have any pressure at all and at discount rates. So we expect as T&E moves up overall, overall discount rate will go up. But having said that, if non-T&E winds up, going through the roof and that puts pressure on MDR, that's fine. We're okay with that. Because again, we manage this industry-by-industry and I can't control mix, but if in fact our non-T&E which has a lower MDR on average than T&E if that continues to grow and grow, I think everybody would be happy with that.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It did want to \u2013 I appreciate 2021, you're looking at it as a little bit about investment view and repositioning, maybe positioning the company for growth. So EPS is not that much of a focus maybe in 2021, but is there another metric that maybe we should focus on, whether it's billings growth, new card acquisitions, something like that as we go through the year, I guess, how will you \u2013 or do you think investors should judge American Express's progress through the year towards the 2022 the goal getting back to, call it $9 a share. Is there a book you could provide maybe on card acquisitions or something else maybe, is that a $2 million before throwing in new acquisition, something like that, anything you could talk about that? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think it all comes back, Mihir, as you pointed out to rebuilding growth moment. And so that's a function of watch our success in bringing new customers into the franchise and in putting new products into the hands of our existing customers. And we'll talk about that every quarter. Watch our success on some of the longer term things that Steve talked about, how we're doing with China, how we're doing with the Kabbage acquisition, watch externally what's happening with credit, and what's happening with the recovery in T&E spending. And those are the key things that I think you want to watch, and it's what we're managing the company for and what we'll give you an update on each quarter.\nSteve Squeri: And we'll continue to update on those things as well as merchant acquisition, which is also going to be important. So sort of the things that I talked about in my first answer exactly what Jeff just said, again, as we said, we don't \u2013 I think as you see more card acquisition momentum, that is a good sign. You see us put more value propositions in there. But also take a look at our merchant network as well, and in the macroeconomic and the sort of the health \u2013 the state of health not only in the United States, but in the world in general.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning. I'm glad to be joining this call. My question is, on the Biden administration, in two areas, stimulus and regulation. On stimulus, just given your overall experience with 2020, how would you expect kind of the proposed next round of stimulus to affect 2021, meaning overall, like good because of the boost in spending and reduction in delinquencies, or more bad because consumers are using a lot of these funds for debt reduction. And then second on regulation, Biden has indicated an increased focus on consumer protection and other aspects of banking regulation. So what are his policy areas are you most focused on keeping an eye out for? Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, it's kind of hard to figure out at this point, what they will do, what will be done from a consumer regulation perspective. You don't know if that's going to be done on debt collection. You don't know where that will be. But look, we've been around 170 years through lots and lots of administrations. We started this sort of regulatory journey, I guess, over the last \u2013 really focused on our industry over the last 15 years or so. And it all started, I think, what UDAP and look we'll comply. We will comply and we will do what we need to do. And I don't think, it's going to be a major deterrent to us running our business in any way. I mean, look, have we added more compliance people over the years? Yes. Do we spend more time with regulators? Yes. Could that be more? Yes, it could probably be more, but when you think about the underlying economics of our business, I really don't think it's going to impact our spend, and if you think about our model, our model is a, get the card, have a fee spend, and then we have lend. We're not as dependent on lending revenues or lending profits as our competitors are, which is probably where a lot of regulation will come in. If it does come in, so we'll see \u2013 we'll just see how that all plays out. And we've been through \u2013 I've been through many administrations since I've been at American Express, we'll do what's required and we've moved on. We've demonstrated we can have success under all scenarios. And what they're not talking about is, they're talking about consumer protection, we're really not talking about discount rate regulation that has not been broached at all in any of these conversations.\nSteve Squeri: The only comment Lisa, I would add on stimulus is given the demographic of our customer base, clearly we are not \u2013 what we want, our healthy consumers and healthy small businesses who are spending, lending is not as a big part of our business model. So if the system being awash in liquidity results in higher pay down rates, well that's, we're happy to take that trade for a healthier economy and for more spending and for more recovery. So we feel good about the credit performance and the spend performance we've had thus far and more stimulus. Should that be the political outcome here? I have to view as a good thing for us.\nOperator: We'll move on to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and good morning. Very good call. On the 2022 targets, I think a couple of the keys are the reacceleration of international that was your highest growing segment, I guess geographically prior to the pandemic. And then also, I mean, I think the B2B payments Kabbage, I think some comments Steve about watching Kabbage. So just some commentary around your confidence that \u2013 and what you\u2019re seeing internationally. I know you\u2019re adding locations, but are you confident that you\u2019re at least maintaining market share or gaining share?\nSteve Squeri: Well, here\u2019s what I would say. What\u2019s interesting, Bob, is that we are adding a lot of locations. Obviously international is being a little bit more challenged than the U.S., our international spending. Our international cards tend to be a lot more T&E focused. And so, they\u2019re down a little bit more, but we believe that will come back. And so, we haven\u2019t run the numbers on sort of market share at this particular point, but as you know we were certainly gaining market share in \u2013 like eight of the key markets that we \u2013 where we participate in. And we believe, again that there\u2019s that pent-up demand for travel. Our attrition numbers are the same, showing the same sort of signs that they show in the United States. When we talk about attrition, we talk about global attrition and there really is no difference between international, how international is performing versus how the U.S. is performing. So, we feel good that that\u2019ll come back in both small business and consumer international were two of the fastest growing areas. As far as Kabbage goes, I think, the thing that we\u2019re really excited about as Kabbage is it gives us a platform that we can interact with our small businesses. And so to be able to go to one platform to not only get a working capital loan, to get a term loan, to have now a business checking account, to be able to have your card product, to do cash flow analysis on the platform, it gives us sort of an all in one platform to serve the needs of small businesses, which is why we did that and what we have been shooting for over the last couple of years. It was just a very fortuitous time and a very fortuitous acquisition for us and that\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll be rolling that out, end of Q1, into Q2 and continuing to make enhancements on Kabbage. So, we\u2019re really excited about it and the opportunities that it brings from a small business perspective.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Carcache with Wolf Research. Go ahead, please.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Jeff.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Can you discuss how the return on each dollar of investment spending today is trending versus pre-pandemic levels on the consumer side? How did the acquisition costs and IRR of new accounts you\u2019re acquiring today compare versus historical levels? And on the commercial side, how are you assessing the profitability of those investments?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think what I\u2019d say overall, Bill, is, I take you right back to our comments that our investment levels in 2021 are going to be driven by that universe of attractive opportunities, not necessarily by a particular budget. So, we were really pleased with what we saw in Q4 citing the example of the U.S. consumer platinum and gold progress we talked about earlier, and we also have some non-travel co-brands on the business side that have been very strong. So, we feel good about the returns. I think you\u2019ve heard, Steve and I say for many years, that we always generally have more good investment opportunities or marketing opportunities with positive returns than we can fund and we\u2019re setting off in 2021 to aggressively rebuild our growth momentum.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDon Fandetti: Good morning. Steve, on competition, you\u2019ve weaned pretty hard into offense. Are you seeing the same thing from Chase? And then, is there any significance to their cxLoyalty acquisition? My sense was maybe it was just like playing catch up, but was there anything more strategic to that competitively?\nSteve Squeri: Look, I think, when we think about competition, you got to think about competition across a wide range of places that we compete. And there\u2019s no more competitive space than the consumer space in the United States. I mean, there is \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve got competition in the UK. We\u2019ve got some competition obviously for small business here, corporate competition and so forth. So, I think it\u2019s just important to understand you compete on many, many fronts and while the consumer businesses is a large piece of it and probably the most highly competitive and it has been for probably 10 years. Look, we anticipate that not only JPMorgan, but Bank of America, Citi Capital, everybody is going be out there looking to get Card Members to bring more into the fold and to drive top-line revenues. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a step down in competition. I think you will see a \u2013 I think, Jamie said on his call, he is stepping up his investments and I think just pretty much every CEO would say the same thing. So, we anticipate that it\u2019s going to be just as competitive as it\u2019s been as we have seen over the last few years. And look we look forward to it and we look forward to competing and we believe our value propositions will continue to stand up well to our competitors. Look, as I don\u2019t know about their acquisition and what it is that they\u2019re trying to achieve, they got a lot of smart people over at JPMorgan and I think they do a really great job running their business, and we get a lot of respect for them. And so, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll figure out how to integrate this into their value propositions to compete in the most effective way that they deem is the right way to go about it. And we\u2019ll continue to do what we do, and we feel good about the hand that we hold and awful going, we\u2019ll see what happens, but I think for more color on that, I would ask Jamie and Gordon.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Go ahead, please.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Good morning. Hi, everybody.\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Craig.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Craig.\nCraig Maurer: I wanted to ask quickly about trends you\u2019re seeing. UK, can you discuss how their lockdowns impacted volume at the end of the quarter and into first quarter? And secondly, what type of rebound do you see in Australia? Is that country now become relatively COVID free? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Well, two comments. In the UK and Europe more generally, as you would expect, Craig, you saw in December and now into January, some significant declines in restaurants and other T&E. But what you continue to see stability in though is the non-T&E spending. So, it\u2019s an interesting observation that as Europe has locked down more, it has the expected impact on restaurants and lodging that people were doing locally, but it doesn\u2019t have an impact on non-T&E. And to go to Australia, Australia, like many of our non-U.S. markets was heavily, heavily or more heavily than the U.S. driven by T&E. And of course, T&E that country has completely shut itself off from the world in terms of cross border travel and there are also many restrictions on cross state travel within Australia. So, non-T&E spending in Australia as it does around the world looks good. But the T&E spending while restaurants are a little stronger there than you might see elsewhere in the world, that\u2019s not where the bigger dollars are. The bigger dollars is on other parts travel. And that\u2019s going to be slower to come back and it\u2019s going to a lessening of the government lockdowns.\nVivian Zhou: With that we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve.

After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks, Vivian. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I hope you and your families are all healthy and safe. As you saw this morning, we announced third quarter earnings of $1.30 per share on $8.8 billion in revenues. While our results continue to be significantly affected by the impacts of the pandemic, we are increasingly confident that our strategy for managing through the current environment is the right one. Overall, I feel very good about the progress we've made in the quarter in a number of key areas. We've seen a steady recovery in our overall spending volumes since the lows of mid April. In fact, non-T&E spending in the quarter, which has long accounted for the large majority of our volumes was up slightly year-over-year. Online consumer retail spending was particularly strong, up 32% over last year. And within our commercial business, AP automation volumes continued their rapid growth, although from a small base, doubling since last year's third quarter, as more businesses adopt digital payment solutions. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent with delinquencies and net write-offs at the lowest levels we've seen in a few years. Nevertheless, we continue to be cautious about the direction that the pandemic impacts on the economy, and this is reflected in our reserve levels, which Jeff will cover in more detail. Voluntary attrition rates on our proprietary products remain lower than last year, demonstrating that our customers continue to see value in our products and services. We continue to invest in our business by launching our largest-ever Shop Small initiative supporting small merchants in 18 markets around the world. Also, the enhancements we made to the value propositions on many of our card products have produced strong results, both in terms of increased spending and customer retention. In addition, we've begun to selectively increase customer acquisition activities across our businesses. Let me quickly review our four key priorities for 2020, which I'll remind you include supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, protecting our customers and the brand, structuring the company for growth, and remaining financially strong. This last priority remaining financially strong is critically important in any environment and especially in these uncertain times as it establishes the foundation for executing against our strategic imperatives across our businesses. I'm pleased to say that we've maintained a strong liquidity position. Our capital ratios are well above our targets, and we've continued to pay our dividend each quarter. In terms of our first priority, supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, from the beginning our goal has been to take care of our colleagues so that they can continue to take care of our customers. As conditions begin to improve in a number of countries since moving virtually all of our 64,000 colleagues to work from home arrangements in March, we've begun the phased reopening of our offices in 25 of our locations, including our headquarters in New York, with a range of new safety procedures to ensure the health and well-being of our colleagues. And we are giving our colleagues the flexibility to continue working from home through June 2021 should they choose to do so. We're really proud of the resiliency and dedication our colleagues have demonstrated through this period, which has helped to drive our progress on our next priority, protecting our customers and the brand. Throughout this period, thanks to the efforts of our frontline staff, our customer satisfaction levels have remained strong and have actually improved globally on a year-over-year basis. Our customers have recognized our commitment to service excellence ranking us #1 in the J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study, the 10th time we've achieved the top spot. In addition to the expansion of our Shop Small program and the enhancements to our value propositions, a key differentiator for us has been the timely rollout of short-term and enhanced longer-term relief programs for customers who have experienced financial challenges during the pandemic. We are no longer seeing new inflows into our short-term programs in the U.S. and we've expanded our longer-term programs to 20 countries around the world. Our last priority is structuring the company for growth. We continue to selectively invest for the long-term. You've seen this in the announcements such as our recent acquisition of Kabbage, a leading financial technology company serving small businesses in the U.S., and in the official launch of our network in mainland China, where in addition to signing merchants and cementing relationships with key digital partners, WeChat and Alipay, we're currently working to develop debit capabilities on our network to capture some of the significant debit usage within China. Let me step back for a moment and tell you how we're thinking about our financial decisions moving forward. We've been looking at our strategy for managing through the cycle through the lens of three phases. The first phase has been about navigating through the peak of the crisis and we've been focused on this phase the past few quarters. The second phase, which we're now in the early stages of, is about rebuilding our growth momentum by increasing investments in key strategic areas. Our goal in doing this is to enable us to enter the third phase generating pre-COVID levels of earnings and returning to our financial growth algorithm. While we hope that the worst is behind us, we do not know for certain that that's the case. We recognize that there remains a high degree of uncertainty in the environment, and that's why we'll continue our strategy of focusing on the four priorities I just discussed. What's different is that now as we're beginning to see improvements in our business, we will be placing even a greater emphasis on accelerating investments in core strategic areas in order to build momentum and position the company for long-term growth as economic conditions improve. Key areas of investment will include accelerating customer acquisition activities across our businesses, continuing to refresh value propositions on our card products including new, broader lifestyle benefits and additional business centric offerings, developing additional solutions beyond the card to expand our relationships with small businesses, maintaining virtual parity coverage in the U.S. and expanding merchant coverage in key international markets, while strengthening and broadening critical partnerships and enhancing our digital capabilities across our business. The pace of our investment acceleration will be driven by the economic environment, which as you know is highly dependent on the course the pandemic takes, and the availability of additional government stimulus in the U.S. and key international regions. In addition, while we plan to ramp up investments, we will maintain our flexibility by controlling operating expenses and pulling back on investments if conditions deteriorate significantly. Now I can't tell you when phase three will begin, but we're confident that the groundwork we will lay in phase two will provide us with the foundation we need to generate momentum to gain share, scale, and relevance as we exit the recovery phase and return to pre-COVID levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm. Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to take a moment to share my personal thoughts on the current environment. Over the past few months I've spent a lot of time talking with other key leaders across industries, but particularly with our partners, our customers and our Board. I would say that while I'm personally less optimistic in the near-term, I am more optimistic about the longer-term prospects for economy and for American Express. Near-term, there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty about the direction of the virus and its impact on the economy, developments in the political environment, the availability of future stimulus packages, and how local governments will react to changes in local conditions. However, I believe we are well positioned to continue operating successfully through this period by being prepared for the unexpected, maintaining financial flexibility, and quickly adjusting our strategies as necessary. Looking at the longer-term, I am more optimistic. I believe there's a pent-up demand among consumers to travel again once they feel safe to do so after many months sheltering at home. At the same time, I believe the increases we see in online spending and the creative pivoting of business models in the small business community will continue, and I believe we are poised to take advantage of the opportunities these trends present. I also believe that this crisis has made us even more resilient, and agile, and flexible as a company, which will continue beyond this crisis and make us even stronger over the longer term. Having said that, no one knows what the future will bring, but regardless we will continue to do what we're best at; focusing on what we can control such as taking care of our colleagues and serving our customers, putting the right building blocks in place and creating momentum to drive future growth. Thank you and let me now hand it over to Jeff who will walk you through our financial results.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve and good morning everyone. As I have over the last two quarters, I'm going to talk you through a different little more detailed set of slides from what we've used historically in order to help you understand how our business is performing in this unprecedented environment. The key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends along with this quarter see early days of some spending on what Steve just called phase two, our efforts to rebuild growth momentum. So I'll spend most of my time in these areas. Let's get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. As you can see, our results this quarter are better than Q2, spending rose sequentially, our credit provision was much lower and we used these improved results to begin to fund more efforts to rebuild growth momentum. That said, our results obviously continue to be significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world. Third quarter revenues of $8.8 billion were down 20% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis driven by declines in spend lend and other travel related revenues while card fee revenues continued to grow. Net income was $1.1 billion and earnings per share was a $1.30 in the third quarter, down 38% from a year ago. To get into the details of our performance, let's start with volumes. As we have all year, we will continue to show you our billed business performance with a bit more granularity on monthly trends. Looking at the first few weeks of October, I would point out that we have not seen any material changes thus far in October compared to the monthly and quarterly data for Q3 that we will focus on this morning. Slide 4 shows that after hitting a low in the second quarter, overall billed business declines have improved sequentially to down 20% year-over-year in Q3 on an FX adjusted basis. Our proprietary business, which makes up 86% of our total billings drives most of our financial results was down the same 20%. The remaining 14% of our overall billings which comes from our network business, GNS was down 16% in the third quarter. Now when you look at our proprietary billed business today, you really have to talk about T&E spending and non-T&E spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends as you can see on Slide 5. Non-T&E spending, which has long been the majority of our volumes has recovered to pre-COVID levels and actually grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter. T&E spending remained down much more significantly, though it did show some continued modest sequential improvements throughout the third quarter driven primarily by consumers. These very different trends in non-T&E versus T&E drive much of the difference in volume performance by segment and by customer type that you see on Slide 6. In the consumer segment for example, U.S. consumer spending has recovered faster than international consumer, due to the higher mix of non-T&E spending in our US volumes. In the commercial segment, spending from small and medium sized enterprise customers, which historically has the highest mix of non-T&E spending, has been the most resilient so far. Whereas large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily T&E has been down the most during the pandemic. I will also remind you that spending from our SME customers represents the majority of our commercial billed business. We drill down further into all these points as you turn to Slide 7, which points out overall historically non-T&E spending was 70% of our proprietary billed business. Today non-T&E categories represent 88% of our proprietary billed business. This mix shift has occurred across all customer types as you see at the bottom of this slide. So what's driving this beyond the obvious decline in T&E spend? Well, as you would expect, we have continued to see an increasing shift to online and card-not-present spending in the current environment. This shift is most evident in the consumer business, whereas commercial spending in the non-T&E categories has been predominantly online for quite some time as you can see on Slide 8. You see more about these shifts on Slide 9 with consumer online spend continuing to grow in the double digits at an accelerated pace relative to pre-COVID levels up 20% year-over-year in the third quarter, even as offline spend has gradually recovered from the April low. In our commercial segment in contrast, since most of the spend was online even pre-pandemic, the online and offline trends are more similar. You see other drivers of the growth in non-T&E spending as you look at the categories of non-T&E spend by segment on Slide 10. For consumers, you see the growth in non-T&E spending is driven by strong growth in online retail spending in line with the growth we just spoke about. For commercial, since the bulk of spending was already online, the most significant area of growth is in Advertising, Media and Communications, particularly from small and medium sized enterprises, as they evolve their marketing and customer engagement strategies in the current or digital environment. So overall, we see that consumers and SMEs in particular, have adapted their behaviors to the challenges of the current environment, which is why non-T&E spending has recovered to pre-COVID levels, and is starting to show some growth. Now coming back to T&E on Slide 11 is a reminder the majority of our T&E spending has historically come from our consumer business and that is even more true today. And consumer T&E spending has continued to see a much faster recovery as shown on Slide 12, followed by small and medium sized enterprises, and then large corporations. We expect this trend to continue, given the pent up demand to travel that we see in our consumer base, and our expectation that corporations, particularly large ones, will continue to limit their T&E spending for some time. You also see the different pace of recovery within the categories of T&E. Cruises, which are a very small part of our business, have been slower to recover, followed by the airlines. Restaurant spending on the other hand has been the most resilient throughout. In between, you see lodging and other T&E where you continue to see spending volumes modestly recover, but at varying paces. For example, spending on home rentals, and at resorts, we are seeing domestic leisure travelers have been performing better than spending at hotels in urban locations. You see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions on Slide 13, which have more travel related spending historically, and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume. U.S. spending volumes continue to steadily recover throughout the third quarter. On the other hand, the volume recovery in Europe and Asia has moderated somewhat in line with some additional restrictions in key markets for Amex [ph], such as the UK, parts of the EU, Japan and Australia. And finally, as we look at spending in the U.S. across our six largest states from a volume standpoint on Slide 14, I would say that the trends across states have been perhaps surprisingly similar, given the variance in medical trends and government policies. So, moving next now to loans and receivables on Slide 15. Loans declined by 17% year-over-year in the third quarter primarily driven by lower spending volumes. As you've heard from many other institutions, we also saw higher payout rates in the third quarter which drove a small sequential decline in loan volumes despite the improvement in spend versus Q2. Based on what we see today if you assume some continued improvement in spending levels, I would expect this quarter to be the low point for loan balances, and looking forward for those balances to start to grow modestly sequentially beginning in Q4, mostly driven in the beginning, by transact volumes rebounding. Card member receivables on the other hand were up 9% sequentially in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, driven by the improvement in spending volumes I just spoke about. So let's go now to our traditional credit metrics, which you see on Slide 16, and you see the credit trends in the third quarter were solid, and remained best in class. Card member loans and receivable write-off dollars excluding GCP were actually down, 3% and 15% year-over-year respectively in the third quarter. You do see an increase in write-off rates year-over-year, but this is primarily due to the significantly lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to there being any significant change yet in these traditional credit metrics. So we would expect to see some impact on these metrics in future quarters. In addition, our delinquency dollars and rates continued to be down year-over-year and sequentially in the third quarter and in fact, our third quarter delinquency rates are the lowest we've seen in several years, which is certainly unusual given the economic environment. We feel good about our credit performance, our risk management capabilities, and the work we've done to manage our exposure so far. It all starts with the changes we've made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which gave us a solid starting position, as well as the way we mobilize our organization to ensure that we have the appropriate programs and people in place to support our Card members who needed financial assistance. Of course, like others, our customers are also helped by external factors, such as the impact of record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. As a result, we do remain cautious about the potential for future shocks to the economy, and that caution is reflected in the macro economic outlook that informs our credit reserves. Moving on to Slide 17, you will see that our provision expense for the third quarter is significantly lower sequentially and also declined 24% year-over-year, simply reflecting our strong credit performance as well as a modest adjustment to our reserves. As we think about the range of economic outcomes that are used in our modeling of CECL reserves to the expected lifetime loss of the receivables and loans on our balance sheet. You will see on Slide 18, that the range of macroeconomic assumptions we have used in our calculations are more divergent for the third quarter relative to Q2. The baseline scenario has improved a bit from the prior quarter, but the downside scenario is more pessimistic. And we have weighted it more than we did in Q2, given the continued high level of uncertainty in the economy and the pace of recovery. The impact of this more cautious set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models was offset by our favorable credit metrics and also a modest sequential decline in loan volumes this quarter, resulting overall and there being very little change to our reserve levels as you can see on Slide 19. We ended the third quarter with $6.5 billion of reserves representing 8% of our loan balances and 1% of our card member receivable balances respectively in line with Q2 and up $2.2 billion from their pre-pandemic levels. So how do we feel about this level of reserves in today's environment? We believe that the reserves on our balance sheet are appropriate given the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios. And looking at the balances that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on Slide 20, those balances continue to decline sequentially to $4.2 billion dollars at the end of Q3, and now stand $1.4 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic. As we wound down the short-term customer pandemic relief program that we put in place at the height of the crisis in March, we've continued to see that the majority of the balances that have exited the program have remained current. The increase in our longer term financial relief program balances over the past few quarters reflects the effectiveness of the work we have done to help card members that need financial assistance to enroll in the right longer term program for them. Historically, the credit outcomes of card members that enroll in these programs are better than those that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs, and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in FRP have been in line with our historical experience. Only time will tell what the ultimate level of rails [ph] will be given the completely unprecedented nature of the global environment. But we feel good about our risk management practices, the way we are managing our exposure to the current environment, and the resulting level of reserves we are at. Moving on to revenues on Slide 21, revenues were down 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. Given the spend centric nature of our business model revenue declines have improved sequentially in line with volume since the lows of mid April. Turning to our largest component of revenue discount revenue, I would move you ahead to Slide 23. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in T&E and non-T&E billings trends. This drove a 12 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the third quarter relative to the prior year, since we on average earn higher discount rates with T&E merchants versus non-T&E merchants. Looking forward, if T&E spending continues to modestly recover, we would expect to see slightly less year-over-year discount rate erosion in the fourth quarter. Turning next to Slide 24, net card fee growth has been strong throughout this year and grew 15% this quarter, demonstrating the impact of the continued strong card member engagement that Steve discussed. But growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the crisis. I do expect some continued deceleration in growth rates, but I would still expect double digit at card free growth in the fourth quarter. Moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on Slide 25, on the left hand side you see the net interest income declined 15% on an FX-adjusted basis which was slightly less than the loan declines we saw in the third quarter due to the year-over-year expansion in yield that you see on the right hand side of the page. Net interest yield on our card member loans increased 40 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter driven by modest tailwinds from lower funding costs mix and effectively pricing for risk. Looking forward into the fourth quarter and assuming we continue to see higher payout rates from revolving card members I would expect net interest income to be relatively flat sequentially. Moving on to Slide 26, we're continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which come down naturally, spend declines in benefit, excuses [ph] changes and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 27% year-over-year driven by lower spend and lower usage of travel related benefits. The year-over-year decline in variable customer engagement expenses provided a 50% offset to the revenue decline in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, I'd expect to see somewhat less of an offset. If the recent modest uptick in T&E rewards redemptions, and usage of travel related benefits continues. We are clearly seeing evidence of pent up demand for travel in our membership rewards base as card members are banking points to use on future travel as opposed to redeeming them on one of our many non-travel related redemption alternatives. In contrast to the declines in variable customer engagement expenses, marketing expenses were up 23% year-over-year. This aligns with Steve's earlier point that we have entered the second phase of our strategy for managing through this cycle, which is about rebuilding growth momentum. The increase was driven by the enhancements we have made to our value propositions and by the approximately $200 million we spent on our largest ever Shop Small campaign. Based on the current economic environment, I would expect our marketing expense in the fourth quarter to be at levels similar to the third quarter. Finally, operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as we executed on our cost reduction plans. Looking ahead, we have begun selectively spend in areas critical to rebuilding growth momentum as we enter phase two. As a result, we expect our Q2 through Q4 year-over-year OpEx declines will be somewhat less than the $1 billion we initially discussed back in April which in hindsight was at the moment of peak uncertainty about the future. Moving last to capital and liquidity on Slide 27, our capital and liquidity positions remained tremendously strong as they have all year. Our CET1 ratio increased to 13.9%, our highest level since we began reporting this ratio, reflecting the retention of capital generated by stronger earnings this quarter. Our cash and investment balance remained at a near record high of $55.5 billion in the third quarter. We obviously remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty. Looking forward, we are committed to our dividend distribution, and to our long term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11% as the economic situation becomes clearer, and as the Fed allows banks to resume share repurchases. In summary, though the external environment remains uncertain in the near term, we are confident in how we are managing the company for the long-term. The investments we are making in phase two will provide us with the foundation we need to rebuild growth momentum to gain share scale and relevance as we exit the recovery phase and return to pre-COVID levels of earnings in our financial growth algorithm in phase three. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. So, Jeff, October you said hasn't changed much, but if you look at September, I mean, in the U.S. most of the states are sort of ramping up in terms of their year-over-year. Has that ramp up continued or has that stalled?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, good question, and we chose not to add the first half of October this time because the trends all continue . So, what that means is, you do continue to see modest, but steady improvement in the U.S. and you do continue to see a little bit more caution in Europe and markets like Australia and Japan. So, I think if you look at those July, August, September trends, it gives you a pretty good sense of what we're seeing right up through today.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nStephen Squeri: Hi Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, thanks for the time this morning. A question on the phased, entry into phase two in the marketing. I heard you're moving into the phase two here, I wanted to understand what you saw in your customer set that said this is the right time to do this now, and how that feeds into, not only the marketing piece, but the other investments you're making, should we take from that that year-on-year is now going to be more normal than down? And then the other piece of that question is, if this more negative scenario that you outlined very cleanly, and clearly in your deck on the negative environment, if that were to happen do you flex back to the phase one environment? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: So let me -- I'll take that, Betsy. And let me provide a little bit of context overall on how we think about this. When I first took over, I was asked the question, how I would navigate in a credit situation. Nobody ever asked me the question how I'd navigate the pandemic, but I was asked that question. I was also asked that question when we had our investor call this year. And what I said was, we would invest for the long-term through a crisis, and that's what we're doing. So why start now? And, look, we entered phase two basically towards the latter stages of the third quarter as far as I'm concerned. What we saw is exactly what Jeff just talked to Don about. We saw a steady improvement in billings. We have a real understanding of what's going on from a credit perspective, and for us it makes sense to invest in the business. And let's look at sort of how I think and how the executive team thinks about this. When we look at this particular quarter, if you dive into these numbers, what you will see is that our marketing expenditure in this quarter was up 23% year-over-year, not sequentially, but year-over-year. And I don't know how many people had that either in their calculus or sort of in their models. But you know, during times like this, probably to go to move is to reduce marketing. But we don't believe that that's true. What we believe in a situation like this is the most important thing that we can do is solidify our foundation. And our foundation is built on two things. It is built on our card members, our merchants, card members and merchants and our brand. And what you saw us do in the third quarter, from a merchant perspective and a brand perspective, we invested $200 million in 18 countries over 12 weeks in the largest small business campaign that we've ever done in the history of the company. And that has given us with our constituents in small business, a lot of positive impact. It has helped the brand. It resonates on who we are. From a card member perspective, we continue to make value injections. And the reality is, is what has happened is that you see attrition levels lower than last year, and a lot of our card members are fee paying card members, and they are sticking with us because: number one, we continue to invest in the relationship, number two we continue to provide the best service in the industry. So, it was very important for us to solidify that foundation, and I said that's what we would do and that is exactly what we are doing. The second point I would make, and this gets to investing for growth, was once you solidify that foundation, how do you build on that foundation? And we did three very specific things in the quarter. The three things that we did, were number one, we stepped up card acquisition, sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, we have 40% increase in cards acquired. We acquired 1.4 million card members in the quarter versus 1 million, that's down from last year, but we're selectively doing it because what we are doing is we have more line of sight right now into behaviors. We have more line of sight into the potential customers that we can acquire. We went out and we acquired Kabbage. Kabbage is going to accelerate our efforts in small business from a platform perspective by anywhere from 18 to 24 months from what we would invest in ourselves, and Kabbage will help us create really an SME digital banking platform, which is all inclusive. And so, we feel good about that and we launched our network in China, and we certainly feel good about that and we continue to invest in coverage. So, as I sit here, it would have been pretty easy for me to say to the team, let's reduce marketing by 20%. Let's do this, and so forth. And if you look at sort of the numbers that we reported, are between our increase in marketing and the lack of a reduction, that's like a $0.40 EPS swing. So, if I were to reduce marketing by 20% as opposed to increase marketing by 20%, we'd be sitting here potentially talking about $1.70 EPS. But the reality is, in this environment, $1.70 EPS is short term, short lived, and not what we're focused on as a company. What we are focused on as a company is continuing to build this brand and to build this franchise for the long-term, and the investments that we are making will play out for years to come. To your question about will we pull back and what do we need to see about pulling back? We'll continue to watch the credit markets. We will continue to see how our card members behave. We'll continue to see how governments open up. So for example, if everything was closed, it made no sense to do that small business promotion. We had decided to do that small business promotion really in early May at the right time, and we waited till the end of June to launch it in the United States because states weren't opening. So, we will pull back on marketing from both an acquisition perspective and a support perspective, if we see closures or if we don't have the line of sight insight. And the nice part about that is, is we have the flexibility to do that and we're not committed. But what we are committed to doing is to continue to invest in this franchise for the longer term.\nOperator: Next we will go to the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Squeri: I think we lost him.\nOperator: One moment here, let me see if I can get him back.\nStephen Squeri: We got the first half of a word.\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes.\nOperator: David, can you press one, zero again? David, are you there?\nDavid Togut: Yes, I am. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Okay, yes.\nStephen Squeri: Yes, great.\nDavid Togut: Thanks so much. Steve, you called out maintaining virtual parity coverage in the U.S. with Visa and MasterCard and you articulated some initiatives there. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more about your thoughts around the MDR and how that could evolve going forward? And then international expansion, you also highlighted, you pulled back in Europe and Australia with GNS being effectively shut down. How are you thinking about expanding in some of these international areas in this environment? Is it more with the proprietary card going forward?\nStephen Squeri: Well, let me just answer the second question first and I'll come back to the first one. But yes, look, I think in Europe and in Australia, the way sort of regulations work, our economic model doesn't really work in a GNS environment. And so to remind people, we do have a premium discount rate within Europe and within Australia. And within Europe if in fact, we had gone to a four party model, which we had a four party model and we had a three party model, it would have regulated our interchange, and therefore reduced our margin significantly. So we're effectively out of GNS as it relates to Europe and as it relates to Australia. But if you look at our business, the two fastest growing pieces of our business pre-pandemic, was our international SME business and our international consumer business. And, what the advantage that we do have is, we are able to really target card members who are looking for tremendous value within the products. And so you see, a preponderance of fee based products in international with a lot of value from a card member and driving significant spends into those markets. So we continue to invest in Europe in card acquisition, but more importantly, right now we're investing in merchant coverage. And what we've done is we've looked at sort of our international markets and we've talked about strategic markets and sort of the top markets that we invest in, but we also look at the cities where our card members live and where they travel to. Now obviously, card members are traveling anywhere right now, but we do look at the top cities across the world and we have focused our coverage efforts in really, to get a lot more targeted coverage and we've had lots of success and we will continue to do that. So and we're using the same kinds of tools that we did in the United States, whether it's while we can't use an OptBlue program in Europe per se, we're using our one point, aces [ph] telemarketing and so forth, and we see significant coverage increases in those markets in international. So we are still committed. We are still investing and once we get through this pandemic they will continue to be some of the fastest growing pieces of our business. As far as the U.S. and let's just talk about the discount rate for a second, we saw actually a sequential increase in the discount rate this quarter, obviously a decrease year-over-year, and that is really due to mix. And so, when you look at mix, with T&E being 69% down year-over-year, and those industries having the higher MDR, that's what's really driving it. Maintaining virtual parity coverage, we are there. Any discount rate erosion that was either contemplated or done has been done as it relates to OptBlue and virtual parity coverage, so we're beyond that. I think what you're seeing now in the discount rate erosion is really due to mix of business. And what our expectations are is when we get back to a normal environment, whenever that may be, you will see a normal mix, because we believe and look, I don't know about you, but I'm going a little bit crazy just sort of staying in my house and not traveling and not being on a road seeing customers and partners and colleagues or taking vacations with my family. And so, there is a pent up demand certainly for consumer travel and you're seeing a little bit more of that very, very small right now, but there is going to be a big pent up demand and we'll be there and ready to serve that demand when it comes to fruition.\nOperator: Next we'll go the line of Bill Carcache with Wolf Research.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Steve and Jeff. If we look ahead 12 months from now, hopefully we're in an environment where travel and spending have more fully normalized, but retaining existing customers until we get to that point seems like a critical element of your strategy. Can you frame for us, you think about the dynamics around the cost of retaining an existing customer today, versus the cost of losing that customer and having to reacquire them later?\nStephen Squeri: Well I think the dynamics is very simple. It has traditionally and over time, and will always be a lot cheaper to retain a customer than it is to acquire a new customer. And so it is an investment that we are making and we'll continue to make. I mean, just think about what it takes to sort of mine to go get new customers and then to bring them along from a spending perspective. We have sort of work with our customers here to target their spending and what we're seeing is, obviously some of our customers are spending in areas now they hadn't spent before. And if you look at sort of some of the things that we've done with streaming credits and even with wireless credits, and even shipping credits, we have actually engaged our card members to spend in areas that they hadn't spent in before. And it's always amazing to me, that the dynamic of how people compartmentalize their spending. And you would just think that, everybody who is, using the product would use it consistently across these things. But some of these programs that we've had to retain customers have actually helped to open up new categories and so where they're spending with us. And so what happens here is, as we open up those new categories, that will continue and be consistent over time as they then get back to their travel spending. So I think some of the investment and some of the spending that we're seeing now is going to benefit us going forward. So bottom-line, much, much cheaper, and I can't give you the exact numbers, the ROI\u2019s and so forth, but much cheaper to retain an existing customer than it is to mine for a new one.\nJeffrey Campbell: And Steve, I might just also point back to your earlier comments about our attrition rates being down versus pre pandemic. The foundation of our business are very long term customer relationships. And when you look at our best customers, the attrition rates are remarkably low. Customers stay with us for a very long time. And so that's what we build the company on Bill, and that's what we're focused on maintaining through the pandemic.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks for taking my questions and really appreciate the additional disclosure, it's very helpful in understanding a lot of these trends. Just looking at Slide 20, I am curious if the financial relief programs that you're offering are disproportionately being offered to the SME borrowers and if that's an area that we should be watching in terms of emerging credit.\nJeffrey Campbell: So that's actually a really good question, Rick and since you flipped to page 20, I'll encourage everyone to flip, because the really interesting thing is that if you go back to April, so the peak moment really in hindsight of uncertainty. In April, there were a disproportionate number of our SME customers who signed up for our very short-term to one month as you recall, Customer Pandemic Relief Program. The really interesting thing though, as the months have gone by, is when you go to today into the numbers on the far right of page 20 in fact, the SME customers are no longer a disproportionate share. And so it appears to us that the small and midsized enterprise customers, I think, prudently said well heck, not sure what the future holds. If there's programs out there, I'm going to sign up for it back in April. But most of them have pulled out of it have not signed up in disproportionate numbers for the FRP programs and so we feel good about small business. And in fact, I think it's probably worth reminding everyone that our small business card members are predominantly people like contractors and architects and lawyers, who for the most part are thriving in the current environment and only a very small percentage of our small business card members are in some of the hardest hit sectors like restaurants or online retail or excuse me offline retail.\nOperator: Next, we'll go the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you and good morning. Steve, the B2B payments market is an area that you've done, American Express has done a lot of investing in. And I know it's off to small base, but you bought at acompay, you're partnering with Bill.com, with MineralTree, with Coupa and with others, what is the long term vision for that business? When does it become not operable at a small base and is this something that could be 10% or a real material portion of the American Express business over the long term?\nStephen Squeri: Yes, well look, I think that, you call out a number of the partnerships that we have, whether it's with Coupa, whether it's with SAP, whether it's with a Ariba. Obviously, the acompay our own product, that's only a component of it. I would argue that a lot of the B2B is built into the SME piece of it right now, because look, 80% of our SME volume is non-T&E. And, if you are a small business, if you're a lawyer or you are a contractor, you're buying your supplies to run your company that way. So, I think what you're really talking about Bob is the automation piece of that, right? And, and even if you look at our corporate card business, our corporate card business, obviously there's nobody, I mean, hardly anybody that is sort of traveling at this point. And, the T&E component of our corporate card business is really, really down. And the reality is, is that component of our business is only 6% of our overall business. And yet our corporate card business is not down nearly as much as the corporate card T&E piece, because of some of the inroads we've made with B2B from a corporate perspective. And so, I think what we probably need to do is figure out how to frame this a little bit better. But the reality is, is that so much of our SME and corporate spending is actually B2B today. What we're really talking about is how do you automate it and that's what we're working on and I think over time that will become bigger. But I would argue a lot of that spending is a large percentage of our growth right now in SME, and I think when you get into large corporate, there is a big opportunity to do that. And that's, when you look at the partnership with bill.com, obviously that is not targeted at a large corporation. That is targeted at an SME and our acompay is the same thing. So, more to come on that, but I think it is a growing piece. And what you're seeing with the doubling of acompay automation is the actual automation versus the normal card usage that you would normally see.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJamie Friedman: Thank you for the additional disclosures Steve, Jeff. I just wanted to ask the GNS actually declined less than proprietary. I was just -- maybe a minor detail, but I was just wondering, is that because of easier comps or is that less well, T&E in GNS? Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: You know Jamie, if you think about the fact that because as Steve talked about earlier, we have had to pull out of the GNS business in Europe and Australia, what's left is not necessarily a group of business that is representative of what's happening around the globe. And in fact, a handful of company -- countries account for a large percentage of the volume and those countries happen to be places like South Korea and Japan and Brazil and Israel. So particularly with South Korea is the largest single country and if you think about how they have done with their particular approach to the control of the virus and the economy, it kind of made sense that it would be a little bit stronger. But it's not really, those numbers aren't reflective of kind of an average across the whole rest of the world is what I would say.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Jeff, as you alluded to earlier, you maintain that 10% to 11% economic capital requirement and prior to the pandemic, you had manage down to it quite effectively. But it's obviously expanded, again with the roll off of balances here and the suspension of the buybacks. Can you just help us think through, when you'll be able to return to buybacks? Is that just going to be set driven based on the results of your new stress test or is it going to be also self determined based on what you see? And when you feel comfortable buying back shares at what pace should we think about you kind of drawing that down back to your longer term economic capital requirements?\nJeffrey Campbell: Yes, all good questions, Mark. So a couple things. I mean, clearly, we do need to wait until the Fed allows share repurchases again, but as I say that I'd remind everyone that for us the Fed requirements on capital are well below our 10% to 11% target. So they're not really a constraint on being at that level. They're only a constraint because right now, they've just blanketly said to everyone, you can't do share repurchase. So once they give the green light. The other thing is we do want to make sure we have visibility into the future direction of the economy. As we sit here today we've talked a couple times, both Steve and I, about the fact that while our baseline as things continue to get a little bit better, we have to be ready for the fact that they may not, we'll have to see. So we need a little bit of economic clarity and then we'll go and we'll start working towards our 10% to 11% target. I wouldn't expect Mark, to see to have us do an accelerated share repurchase and get there in one quarter. But you'll see us go back to the kind of pace we were doing before, which will get us there over the course of a relatively small number of quarters.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank.\nMeng Jiao: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Steve, I just wanted to check in with you, in your conversations with some of your larger partners, I wanted to get a sense on how they're doing and what's continuing to be worrisome to them in this climate and going forward? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Well, I mean, if you look, we've got we've got lots of partners, right? I mean, I had a conversation with Dan Schulman, he didn't have a lot of worries then and they're doing great and we're doing great partnership with them between, pay with points and being embedded within the PayPal ecosystem and that's a great partnership for us. And when I talked to Ed Bastian, I think Delta is doing a great job navigating the crisis, but they're at the mercy of how people feel. And but when you look at our cards with Delta, that spending is at or better than the spending that we have all our other products. And the same thing, when, if I talked to Chris [ph] Mascetta [ph] in [indiscernible] that at Marriott [indiscernible] at Hilton, perspective is, it's a slow recovery here. And when you think about sort of the hotel industry, conventions is a big part of it and that's not going to probably come back anytime soon. But they're starting to see an uptick in more localized days, where people can drive to a hotel and not travel, and even Delta is starting to see a little bit of a pickup as well. But I think, consistent with what I've said, I think you're looking to see a tick up in consumer behavior from a travel perspective, sort of towards the end of the year first quarter next year, but I think we're all consistent in terms of how we feel about business travel, which is probably not going to be until late 2021 or early 2022. But what I would say is that, whether it's Hilton, BA, Marriott or Delta, we are really pleased with the partnerships that we have from a co-brand perspective, and those cards in the markets they're in are performing at or better than our overall portfolio. And it's because as I've said many times, people are invested in their products for the longer term, they're invested in their miles, they are invested in their experiences. And when you put great brands like that together and create great experiences, people will hold on, and that's what's happening and this will pass. When it's going to pass? I can't tell you, but it will pass and as a society, as a world, we will figure out how to navigate this over time.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, good morning, Jeff and Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Hi Greg.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hi Greg.\nCraig Maurer: So, two questions for you. First, on the merchant discount rate, more specifically when typical seasonality would suggest that the implied rate or the calculated rate would fall in fourth quarter? Curious if your expectation is that T&E will recover enough in the fourth quarter to offset that typical decline? And secondly, professional fees were materially higher than what we had expected and I was curious if that was driven by support for things like the Small Business campaign?\nStephen Squeri: Well, the answer to the first one is easy and quick. I do expect that the steady improvement we're seeing in T&E will more than offset any of the normal seasonality. The discount rate, I would remind you that even though T&E is down a lot more than non-T&E, if you actually look at the rate of improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter Craig, T&E is improving faster, because it fell so much and so we expect that in general to continue. And then the professional fees, remember, we're constantly moving back and forth between particularly on the technology side, work we do in house versus work we do through a variety of different firms we work with around the globe. So you really need to focus overall on OpEx, which we feel good about being down a couple hundred million again this quarter versus the prior year and of course, being down much more than that versus our original plan.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the improvements going forward through the back part of this year. Are you guys concerned maybe the cooler weather might affect people eating out? You might have more closures, lack of stimulus, the Small Business initiatives that you have kind of sunset? Can you just talk about your confidence in the acceleration of the growth? And then, these new accounts that you're bringing on, when do you expect to get traction on the top line from those customers?\nStephen Squeri: Well, look I think, just to the first piece of this, as I said in my remarks, I mean, there's just so much uncertainty on everything that you just mentioned, which is why I think it's so important to keep that flexibility. I mean, everything that you said, could come to pass. Whether it does or not, I do not know and that's why we need to keep flexibility. And that's why also we did our investment in sort of Small Business when we did it. We will still do our Small Business Saturday on a global basis. We're committed to doing that and we will continue to invest in those brand building activities. But I think Sanjay look, I mean, I think when you look at the Northeast, you don't know what's going to happen in terms of restaurants, you don't know if you're going to be at 25%, you're going to be at complete closure, it's going to be pretty hard to eat outside in the snow and things like that. But then if you go to Florida, you have 100% openings right now. So you have inconsistency across the United States, you have inconsistency across the globe. And so we're going to have to just continue to watch that and we're also going to continue to make sure that we are taking into account from an investment perspective, how the two of those things meet up. But what I would also tell you is, look we've got salespeople out right now doing face-to-face calls. Obviously, social distancing, masks, and so forth and the reality is they want to get out and people want to see them. So you've got a very different environment, depending upon where you are, in the United States. As far as sort of top line growth for new cards acquired, I think it's going to be hard to see the top line growth, because you've got this compression that's happened due to this travel. So, we'll be looking at, obviously, we're adding on more card members, they're adding on spend. But even as they add on spend, it's -- you're not going to be at a seat because they're not going to have the travel component within early on. And so I think, we'll look at it, but as far as from the outside perspective, you're still going to have this pushed down on revenue year-over-year up until the first quarter of sort of next year probably just because of what has happened to the economy. And so I think it's more second, third and fourth quarter of next year, where additional card members that we add, you'll have a grow over 2020. But when I think about this, and the team thinks about this, we anchor everything off 2019. I mean, we want to get back to that normal state and to get to that grow over from 2019. So, that to us is truly a return to normal.\nVivian Zhou: With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff.

Welcome to the American Express, Q2 2020 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please go ahead.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Alan. Thank you all for joining today\u2019s call. As a reminder, before we begin, today\u2019s discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s future business and financial performance. These are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today\u2019s presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter\u2019s earnings material, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, with some remarks about the company\u2019s progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial performance. After that we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Vivian. Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I hope everyone is safe and well and your families are the same. Let me just jump in. While our overall results for the quarter clearly show the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, Jeff and I will dive into our performance on a more granular level to give you a clear picture of what\u2019s going on. When we last got together on April 24, the global economy was basically in a free fall, and we had no way of knowing if the declines we were seeing in our billings would continue. We now realize that mid-April was when we hit the trough in terms of second quarter spending declines. As we sit here today, there is still much uncertainty about the economic environment as reopenings have stalled in a number of geographies and status of government support programs remains unclear. Nevertheless, I can give you a better sense of where we are and how the COVID-19 crisis has been affecting us to date. Spending volumes overall have been improving gradually since April, when they were down about 40% year-over-year to a decline of about 20% in mid-July. Non-T&E spending has been recovering at a faster pace than T&E categories, and our small business customers have been the most resilient through the period. We\u2019ve not seen an increase in our total customer attrition levels from prior years. With regards to credit, we feel good about our risk management capabilities and the progress we\u2019ve made with the financial relief programs we rolled out to support our customers as they navigate unexpected financial challenges during these unprecedented times. We remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit risk to achieve the best outcomes for both our customers and our shareholders. All in all, I feel good about how we\u2019re managing through this period. Despite the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, we were profitable in the quarter, and we have very strong capital and liquidity position, and we paid our dividend to our shareholders. Importantly, our customers continue to be engaged with our products and services, and I\u2019m confident that our strategy of focusing on what we can control in the short-term while continuing to invest in areas that are key to our growth over the long-term, will put us in a position of strength when this crisis ends. Similar to the first quarter, Jeff will discuss how the current climate is affecting various elements of our financial results. And I\u2019ll give a little more color on what we\u2019re doing to manage the company through the present crisis while positioning ourselves to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead. As a reminder, in Q1, we introduced four key priorities for 2020: supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, protecting our customers and our brand, structuring the company for growth in the future and staying financially strong. We\u2019ve made good progress against this framework, and we\u2019ll continue to use it as a guide through the rest of the year. I\u2019ll go through each of these priorities and give you some highlights of our progress. In terms of our first priority, supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, we\u2019ve been operating on a fully remote basis globally since mid-March. Our frontline colleagues have continued to deliver outstanding customer service and our historically strong customer satisfaction levels have improved globally on a year-over-year basis. More recently, like many other global companies, we\u2019re taking a slow and cautious approach to returning to our offices, and we\u2019re implementing comprehensive safety protocols as our buildings reopen. I also want to spend a minute talking about the recent incidence of deadly violence against the black community and the subsequent demands for actions to combat systematic racism. Like many others, we\u2019re taking a hard look at our own practices across our business and developing a comprehensive plan to strengthen diversity and inclusion within the company, while also increasing our support to black-owned businesses and the black community outside of American Express. As a first step, we made $3 million in grants in 2020 to several nonprofits that support the black community. And as part of our recently launched Shop Small initiative, we pledged $10 million over the next four years to fund the coalition with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, bringing together to U.S. Black Chambers to provide grants to black-owned small businesses.  We view this as just the beginning of a multifaceted, multiyear commitment to do our part to address issues of inequality and to promote social justice. Our next priority is protecting our customers and our brand. To ensure our future success, it\u2019s critical that we continue providing a reliable world-class experience to help our customers manage through these extraordinary times. In recognition of our customers\u2019 evolving needs in this environment, we\u2019ve enhanced our value proposition on many of our consumer and small business products, including adjusting our Rewards Programs and added limited time offers and statement credits in categories that are relevant for today such as wireless, grocery, streaming services, business essentials and food delivery. Early results from these enhancements are encouraging. As I mentioned, we haven\u2019t seen an increase in total customer attrition levels over prior years. In addition, we\u2019re seeing increased card member engagement in several of the new categories where we\u2019ve added value, including streaming and wireless services. We\u2019re also building on our commitment to help small businesses around the world as they struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, we announced our largest-ever global Shop Small campaign, which includes a commitment of over $200 million over the next three months to help jump-start spending at small merchants in over a dozen countries globally. Finally, we\u2019ve had very good results in helping our customers who have required financial assistance during the pandemic. Nearly three quarters [ph] of those in our short-term pandemic relief programs have successfully exited the program and are now current and paying their bills. Many of those needing more time have chosen to enter one of our enhanced longer-term relief programs, which provide additional flexibility in paying balances over time. These longer-term programs are now operating in 20 countries around the world. Our third priority is to structure the company for growth in the future. COVID-19 has had a major impact on the way we live and work, and some of the changes may last for some time, if not permanently. As we begin to see what shape the new normal will take, our focus remains on our customers as we look to deepen our relationships and take advantage of the opportunities that will help us grow our customer base going forward. In our consumer business, we\u2019ll continue to enhance our value propositions to offer features, benefits and experiences that are particularly relevant to our customers\u2019 changing needs. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics now, but you\u2019ll see us continue to refresh our current products and launch new ones, focusing on categories that build upon and add to our traditional T&E offerings. On the commercial side, we\u2019re seeing a significant increase in demand for our automated B2B payment solutions as more customers look for efficient, secure ways to pay suppliers and manage their businesses remotely in this environment. We continue to introduce a range of new B2B payment solutions for businesses of all sizes, such as last week\u2019s launch of American Express One AP for middle-market companies, our first proprietary accounts payable automation offering which is built on a technology of last year\u2019s acompay acquisition. Going forward, we expect to see the trend towards digitizing the B2B payments process to continue, and we will continue to invest in these capabilities. For our merchant partners, we\u2019re helping to meet their growing desire along with consumers for clean payments by raising our contactless transaction thresholds in 60 countries around the world. Throughout this period, we\u2019re continuing to look for more ways to embed American Express into our customers\u2019 digital lives. To facilitate the increasing number of online transactions, earlier this month, we announced, along with other major payment networks, that we\u2019ll begin technical preparations for the international expansion of Click to Pay, a simple and secure digital checkout solution. We also continue to look for opportunities to extend our mutually beneficial strategic partnerships, such as the renewal of our long-standing relationship with British Airways that was announced this morning as well as the extension of our agreement with Marriott during the second quarter. Turning to internal changes, we expect to see an increase in the number of colleagues working from home going forward, which will influence how much real estate we need over the longer term. In the second quarter, we made decisions to accelerate the exit of surplus office space in several countries, and we\u2019re assessing our long-term real estate strategy for a post-COVID world. Finally, as I\u2019m sure you all saw, we recently announced that American Express became the first foreign payments network to be licensed to clear local currency transactions in Mainland China. This historic milestone is many years in the making and represents an important step forward in our long-term growth strategy as well as in the overall development of the payments industry in China. Our fourth priority is to remain financially strong. During the second quarter, we substantially increased our liquidity to record levels, and we further strengthened our capital position with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements. These robust capital and liquidity levels will enable us to continue operating through this uncertain period from a position of strength. Looking ahead, no one can tell how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve or what its impacts will be on the global economy. So, we will continue to focus on what we can control, backing our customers, colleagues and communities, maintaining a tight rein on expenses while seizing opportunities to invest in initiatives that will enable our long-term growth and remain very transparent with all of our key constituents about the trends we\u2019re seeing and how they are affecting our business. That\u2019s a quick roundup of the progress we\u2019ve made on the four priorities I laid out last quarter. These last few months have been extremely difficult for everyone, and I anticipate we\u2019ll continue to face great challenges and uncertainty in the days ahead. While we can\u2019t predict the future, I feel good about how we are managing through the crisis, and I remain confident that we are positioning the company to emerge from this period even stronger. This is how we\u2019ve weathered crises time and time again over 170-year history, focusing on what we can control in the short term while positioning our company for the long term and always believing in our customers, in the power of our brand and in the resiliency and strength of our people. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Just like I did last quarter, I\u2019m going to talk you through a very different set of slides from what we have used historically in order to help you understand how our business is performing in this unprecedented environment, which is obviously unlike any environment any of us have faced historically. Since the biggest drivers of our financial performance in today\u2019s environment are volume and credit trends, I will spend most of my time in these two areas. Let\u2019s get right into our summary financials on Slide 3. As you can see, our results this quarter were significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures. Second quarter revenues of $7.7 billion were down 28% and on an FX-adjusted basis driven by declines in spend, lend and other travel-related revenues as a result of COVID-19. Net income was $257 million in the quarter. You will notice an unusual effective tax rate this quarter of 58.7%. This is due to the combination of our lower overall pretax income and some sizable discrete items primarily related to certain foreign deferred tax assets that were impacted by the current environment. Earnings per share was $0.29 in the second quarter, down 86% from a year ago. Turning to the details of our performance. I will note that as was the case on our last earnings call, quarterly data just isn\u2019t that helpful given the rapidly evolving environment. So we\u2019ll continue to show you our billed business performance and certain other metrics, with a bit more granularity on monthly and recent trends. Let\u2019s begin with billed business, which you see several different views of on Slides 4 through 9. Slide 4, shows you that worldwide billed business declines were the most significant, down around 40% year-over-year in the month of April, when the U.S. and most of our largest international markets were effectively shut down due to COVID 19. Since then, we\u2019ve seen steady improvement in essentially all spending trends. While certain components of spend are now showing growth, our overall billed business volumes remain down year-over-year given the significant role that T&E spending has historically played in our business. In fact, you see on Slide 5 that while T&E spending remains down 75% in the first part of July, our non-T&E billings are actually up about 5% so far in July. This difference between the T&E and non-T&E billings performance particularly shows when you look at our commercial business, where you have the tale of two very different customer types. On Slide 6, you see that spending from our small and midsized enterprises, or SME customers, has held up much better through this period than the spending from our large and global corporate card clients. The majority of the spend from our SME customers is B2B spending while the spend from our large and global corporate card clients is predominantly T&E historically. I would also remind you here that spending from our SME customers represents the majority of our commercial billed business. You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions, which have a higher mix of T&E spend and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume as you see on Slide 7. Now as you would expect, we have seen an increasing shift to online and card-not-present spending in the current environment. This shift is most evident in the consumer business. And you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 8 that for the non-T&E categories, consumer online and card-not-present spend is actually up about 25% thus far in July. And finally, as we all look for signs of where the most recent trends might take us, you see some impact from various markets and states going through shifts in the opening of their economies. I would say, though, that these impacts tend to be modest, as you see one example of on Slide 9, which shows you the latest trends for our four largest states in the U.S. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar pattern. We are just clearly at a point where there\u2019s still uncertainty about where that pattern will go next and at what pace. Turning next to loans and receivables on Slide 10. You see that total loans declined 15% and charge Card Member receivables declined 36% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by our lower spending volumes. This dynamic of our balance sheet shrinking in weaker economic times is an important aspect of our business model as it fuels the extremely strong liquidity and capital metrics I will discuss later. Looking forward into the third quarter, if you assume some continued modest improvement in spending levels, I\u2019d expect the sequential trend in our balances to be fairly stable. Moving on to Slide 11, loan and receivable write-offs, excluding GCP. These things grew just 8% in the second quarter and clearly do not yet reflect incremental stress since not enough time has passed for the impacts of the current environment to flow through our traditional write-off credit metrics. It is worth noting that our delinquency dollars are actually down year-over-year. You do see an increase in write-off and delinquency rates year-over-year, but this is primarily due to the significantly lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to there being any significant change yet in these traditional credit metrics. In contrast, our provision expense on Slide 12 reflects the likely impact on future write-offs of the current stressed environment as we took an additional credit reserve build of $628 million in the second quarter. As you know, macroeconomic forecasts are a key factor in determining the credit reserve build under CECL, particularly in a volatile environment. So turning then to Slide 13, you will see the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in our CECL reserving models for the first and second quarters. This quarter, just like last quarter, you had a worsening macro environment. However, this quarter, there was an offsetting benefit mainly from volume declines, as you can see on Slide 14. We ended the second quarter with $6.6 billion of credit reserves, roughly $2.2 billion higher than the reserve level we had on our balance sheet after we implemented CECL at the beginning of Q1. The increase is from a combination of the $1.7 billion of credit reserves we added at the end of the first quarter as a result of the worsening economic outlook due to COVID-19 as well as the $628 million reserve build we took in the second quarter. Today, our lending and charge credit reserves on the balance sheet represent 8% of our loan balances and 1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. So how do we feel about this level of reserves in today\u2019s environment? Based on what we have learned and seen over the last few months, we do feel good about our risk management practices, the way we are managing risk through the current environment and the resulting level of reserves we are holding. It all starts with the changes we have made over the last few years in our risk management practices, which gave us a solid starting position. When the pandemic hit, we quickly rolled out a new short-term customer pandemic relief program, or CPR, offering primarily one-month payment deferrals, which we believe gave us better visibility into our customer situations, and then rolled out enhanced longer-term programs for customers that need extended assistance as they exit our CPR program. The nature of our charge card products also gives us very real-time visibility into our customers\u2019 situations. And of course, like others, we are also helped by external factors such as the impact of unprecedented levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. Internally, one way we track what is actually happening in our portfolio is through looking at the balances that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs, including the temporary CPR program. As you can see in the bar on the right-hand side of Slide 15, the total of these balances was $5 billion at the end of Q2, around $2.2 billion higher than the BAU level we had at the end of last year pre-COVID. Around the time, we reported earnings last quarter, this metric was up to a peak of $11.5 billion as we saw balances enrolled in the customer pandemic relief program peak in mid-April. Since then, the majority of customers exiting the CPR program have become current and the remainder either enrolled in one of our longer-term financial relief programs or are in the delinquent bucket. Today, we have stopped enrolling new customers in CPR, and only a relatively small balance remains in the program. You will find the details of our CPR [ph] program balances in mid-April and at the end of Q2 in the appendix on Slide 13. The increase in the longer-term financial relief program\u2019s balance over the past quarter reflects the effectiveness of the enhancements we rolled out in April as we continue to work hard alongside our Card Members to help them identify the right program for them so that they can retain their membership and get to a good financial outcome for both our customers and our shareholders. Historically, we\u2019ve seen that the credit outcomes of card members that enroll in our financial relief programs are better than those that do not, with around 80% of enrolled balances successfully completing these payment plans. And when you look at the delinquent and FRP balances on our books today, coupled with our historical experience with Card Member payment behavior, we believe that the reserves we have on our balance sheet are appropriate based on what\u2019s happened so far. Now, only time will tell where the ultimate level of write-offs will be given the completely unprecedented nature of the global environment, but we feel good about our risk management capabilities and the work we\u2019ve done so far to manage our exposure. Moving on to revenues on Slide 16. Revenues declined 28% on an FX-adjusted basis in the second quarter. As you would expect, given the spend-centric nature of our business model, revenue declines hit a trough for Q2 in the month of April and showed steady improvement throughout the quarter. Looking at the details of our revenue performance on Slide 17, you see the impact of the continued strong Card Member engagement that Steve discussed in the 15% growth in net card fees despite declines in all of the revenue lines due to the current environment. We expect this solid growth to continue with some modest deceleration since we have slowed proactive new card acquisition. Other fees and commissions and other revenues were down almost 50% year-over-year due to declines in travel-related revenue streams such as FX conversion fees, our business travel JV income share and commissions and fees from our consumer travel business. These revenue streams are a modest part of our total revenue and typically don\u2019t change much quarter-to-quarter on a BAU environment, but continued to be down significantly year-over-year in the second quarter due to the COVID second quarter due to the COVID impact on travel. Turning to the details of net interest income and yield, I would move you ahead to Slide 18. On the left-hand side, you see that net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 70 basis points year-over-year in the second quarter, driven primarily by mix benefits due to a faster decline in transactor loans relative to revolving loans as well as our ongoing efforts to effectively price for risk. Moving to the right, net interest income declined 8% on an FX-adjusted basis, which was less than the loan declines we saw in the second quarter due to the yield benefits I just spoke about. Our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, declined 38% in the second quarter, as you can see on Slide 19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to the much larger declines we saw in higher discount rate T&E spend versus lower discount rate non-T&E spend in the second quarter. The divergence in T&E and non-T&E billing trends drove a 14 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the second quarter relative to the prior year. Looking forward, if T&E spending remains suppressed, we would expect a similar level of discount rate erosion in the third quarter. Moving on to expenses on Slide 20. We are continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses, which come down naturally as spend declines and benefits usage changes, and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses were down 47% year-over-year driven by lower spend and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year decline in variable customer engagement expenses provided roughly a 60% offset to the revenue decline in the second quarter, a bit more than I would expect to see going forward. Moving on to marketing and OpEx. As we mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we made the decision back in March to aggressively reduce costs across the enterprise for the balance of the year but also to reinvest a portion of those savings in our existing customer base. As a result, we dramatically reduced our proactive marketing efforts for new card acquisition and reinvested in value proposition enhancements, resulting in a 16% decline in marketing expenses in the second quarter. This outcome is a good example of what we\u2019ve long said about the flexibility we have around our marketing investment levels, which can be pulled back as well as redeployed quickly if market conditions and the universe of attractive opportunities change. Operating expenses were down 7% year-over-year in the second quarter, and we are on track to achieve our target of $1 billion OpEx reduction year-over-year cumulatively across Q2 through Q4. Moving last to capital and liquidity on Slide 21. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong and strengthened even further in the second quarter. We also saw healthy deposit growth of 16% during the second quarter even as we adjusted pricing given the current rate environment, as you can see on Slide 31, the Appendix. Due to the countercyclical nature of our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio increased to 13.6%, and our cash and investment balance grew to a record $61.4 billion in the second quarter. We continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a solid balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress. And with our strong capital position, we have the capacity and intend to continue to pay our dividend in the third quarter. We continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress. And our strong capital position provides the capacity, and we will pay our dividend in the third quarter and intend to pay it beyond, subject to our Board approval and so long as financial conditions support it. In summary, no one can know how the future will play out, but we feel good about how we are managing the company for the long term. This morning, we have been clear about how the current unprecedented times are impacting us financially. Looking forward, we have tremendous capital and liquidity strength, the continued engagement of our customers with our brand, and we\u2019re confident that we are focused on the right things to position American Express to grow as the current challenges inevitably recede. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open the line for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your co-operation. And with that, the operator will open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good morning. I\u2019m glad you guys are doing all right, and thank you for the added disclosures in the deck. Those were great. I guess, Steve, you pointed out that conditions are a little bit clearer now versus last quarter. So, I\u2019m curious what your views are on T&E and the size of the market and if your views have changed in terms of there being any structural impact to the market. And then how can we think about American Express responding to that long term? Is B2B a realistic solution over the intermediate term? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Good to hear from you, Sanjay. Let me provide a little context first and then sort of answer the question. So when you look at our overall spending, 70% of our spending before this crisis was non-T&E and growing faster than our T&E business. And 30% was T&E. To drill down a little bit, our corporate card business was 9% of our overall business with about 55% to 60% of that being T&E, and then \u2013 and not growing all that quickly. And then you look at our SME business, which has been the most resilient at this particular point in time, and that business makes up 75% of our commercial business overall and is doing quite well, and probably close to 80% of that spend is non-T&E. So, when we look at what\u2019s going on right now, and we made \u2013 we gave you, obviously, disclosure up to almost mid \u2013 sort of mid-July, we see growth in non-T&E, but we see T&E as still being slow. We\u2019re seeing restaurants come back obviously faster than you see airlines or hotels coming back, but I also think what you\u2019re seeing is there is an unbelievable demand for people to travel. They may not be the same types of travel, but you are seeing people driving to different locations, and albeit when they come back quarantining, but they are driving to different locations. And so we\u2019re seeing a little bit up \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a little bit \u2013 obviously a little bit of uptick in some of our lodging, which would include Airbnb as well and other entities like that. But I think as we think about this longer-term, and you only have to look at what the airline executives said over the last week or so, I think my view has not changed on corporate travel. I think corporate travel will take a while to come back. But eventually, we\u2019ll get back to 2019 levels. You just won\u2019t have all that growth that was happening in between. I think the demand for consumer travel, once consumers feel safe again, you will have this unbelievable pent-up demand for people to want to get out and travel. In fact, our co-brand cards in our consumer business are actually performing better than some of our proprietary cards. Now that may seem counterintuitive, but when you look at our partnership with Delta, Hilton, BA and so forth, these cards are performing better. Why are they performing better? Well, they\u2019re performing better because 90% of the spending is not on the co-brand partner, 90% of the spending. These are not store cards. These are all-purpose cards. And a lot of people, their psychology is they save points for the big trip. The other part of the psychology is I want status, and I can get status through spending. And I think when this is over, status is going to be even more important as we move forward. So I don\u2019t think, from a timing perspective, my view has changed. I think that will be driven by therapeutics. It will be driven by vaccine. It will be driven by the distribution and production of vaccines. But I think that as we look at our spending, we anticipate a slow climb back. And we\u2019re seeing our consumers \u2013 by definition, consumers consume, and there is a pent-up demand to consume. And they will find other ways to consume, as we are seeing. From a value proposition perspective, because I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where people will go next, from a value proposition perspective, part of our DNA has always been to constantly refresh our value propositions. And as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve been talking about refreshing those value propositions from a lifestyle perspective. And so while not getting into specific details on value propositions for competitive reasons, what we\u2019ve done in the short-term is some stopgap measures in terms of various credits and extension of benefits and things like that, which are support \u2013 doing two things: number one, showing our customers we\u2019re thinking about them; but number two is actually getting more engagements in categories that we didn\u2019t have as much engagement in. We\u2019re \u2013 increased our engagement in wireless, and we increased our engagement in streaming. But you will see us continue to morph our value propositions into next year by adding on to our premium-value propositions with more lifestyle, non-T&E aspects and developing other value propositions for other products and services. So I hope I gave you sort of a general view of how we\u2019re thinking about things.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. My question is\u2026\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi.\nJeff Campbell: Hi.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to understand a little bit on the credit side and the reserving that you did. I know you indicated that you feel like you\u2019re in a good place. And so when I think about the reserving levels, I\u2019m looking at the $6.6 billion versus roughly the $5 billion in the delinquency and financial relief programs that you\u2019ve got. So is that how I should be thinking about the forward look? As these financial relief programs either increase or decrease, the reserve will flex around that? And maybe you can give us a sense as to how you\u2019re seeing those reserve buckets between consumer and small business because there\u2019s been a lot of questions around the small business exposure and risk that you\u2019ve got. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. Two good questions, Betsy. I guess the numbers I would actually encourage people to think about are since the beginning of the crisis between last quarter and this quarter, we\u2019ve added $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion of reserves. And of course, that is based upon CECL accounting, which is really about a forecast of the future, and that forecast of the future, I would tell you, while we don\u2019t do our own economic forecasts, the external provider that we use does incorporate into their forecasts such things as government aid running out, such things as perhaps more small business failures and/or layoffs. So that all goes into that $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion CECL reserve build as a forecast. The reason we added Slide 15, which is something we really closely monitor internally, Betsy, is because it\u2019s fact. It\u2019s not a forecast. It shows you the actual experience that we have had through the end of June. And the number I would actually encourage you to look at on Slide 15 is the difference between the total dollars we had that were delinquent or in a financial relief program before COVID-19. The difference between that number and the end of July was $2.2 billion. And very importantly, I pointed out in my script our historical experience is that with people we get into one of our longer financial relief programs, we generally, over time, are able to manage to get about 80% of those balances. So when you look at these numbers and say, boy, we feel good about our credit reserves, we think they\u2019re certainly appropriate, I would point out, depending on what your future view is of the economy, Betsy, if you think there\u2019s going to be several more shocks, government aid running out, then we will need all those reserves. On the other hand, I think what Slide 15 would say if those shocks don\u2019t occur, we may not need all those reserves. We\u2019ll have to see. The last thing I\u2019d say is if you go back 90 days, this is to your second part of your question, Betsy, initially there were a higher percentage of the dollars that were in the small business receivable and loan receivable balances that signed up for CPR than there were consumer. 90 days on now, we actually feel really good about the small business portfolio. And in fact, those numbers have come way down. And I think it\u2019s important to remember \u2013 and Steve, you might want to talk for a second about this. I think people sometimes forget when they look at our small business segment and they think, oh my gosh, that\u2019s restaurants and some of the harder hit sectors, that\u2019s not actually who our small business Card Members are.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So just the other point of that question is there\u2019s \u2013 in that FRP program, as Jeff said, historically, 80% wind up paying us. And when they do that now, they\u2019ll get their membership back and what have you. But there was a \u2013 out of that, there\u2019s more consumer in FRP right now than there is small business. But I think what\u2019s really important about small business, you\u2019ve got to look at the merchant business and you\u2019ve got to look at the small business card business. They\u2019re two completely different businesses. And while we have a huge preponderance of the restaurants across the world and particularly in the United States, from a merchant perspective \u2013 from a merchant acceptance perspective, only 3% of our small business customers are actually restaurants. The concentration of our small business portfolio is professional services, legal, finance, insurance, real estate, about 14%; construction, about 10%; and health care, about 5%. So when you think about small businesses, there\u2019s a wide variety of small businesses. And I think we tend to think about small businesses as the restaurant and the local retail shop. We don\u2019t tend to think about small businesses from a professional perspective. And there\u2019s a lot of people getting a lot of things done in their homes because they\u2019re not going anywhere at this particular point in time. So we\u2019re seeing good activity in those segments. So I think that\u2019s an important distinction between what our merchant base looks like and what our small business card base looks like.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just I appreciate your comments on the discount fees remaining strong this year and the near-term. But your proprietary cards in force did decline for the first time in quite a while. So I was curious. Is that just driven by slower acquisitions? And if you could really just provide some more color on just what you\u2019re seeing in terms of attrition trends and what you\u2019ve been doing to drive retention in this current effort. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, so maybe a couple of points. First, I\u2019d just remind everyone the context here is that for a couple years, the fastest-growing part of our revenue line by far has been net card fees. We feel really good about the level of Card Member engagement that, that represents. And even this quarter, in the face of all the challenges, that line grew 15%, point one. Point two, as Steve pointed out, when you look at our overall attrition levels, they have not gone up at all and are flat to down to where they were a year ago, which we think is a really strong statement about the continued engagement of our card members. What we did do is that we slowed our proactive acquisition because there\u2019s just not enough visibility into the actual credit quality of applicants. So you saw our new cards acquired, which was also disclosed in parts of the press tables, were down significantly year-over-year. The other thing you would expect us to be doing from a risk management perspective is we have been very diligent about looking at people who are inactive card members and canceling those cards. You don\u2019t want to have inactive cards sitting out there in the middle of an economic downturn. So really, that combination of slower new card number acquisition along with some of the inactive cancellations that we\u2019re doing are why, when you look at that total card number, you see the numbers you do. But we feel really good about our attrition levels, we feel really good about our Card Member, and I\u2019d expect to see net card fees continue to grow in the double digits.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. I mean the most important thing \u2013 so if you look at exactly the number you looked at, that\u2019s what you see. The most important thing for me in looking at the business is voluntary attrition, and voluntary attrition levels are down year-over-year. And from an acquisition perspective, you don\u2019t want to be the spender or borrower here of last resort. And so we have been very, very circumspect about how we keep the channels going and what have you and who we take in and who we don\u2019t take in. But what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve kept our channels open because \u2013 you\u2019ve got to keep those channels open because you want to be able to turn them on at the appropriate time. There will be a pent-up demand, and I don\u2019t want to have to sort of regen all the channels that we have. But the thing that I look at on a weekly basis \u2013 and we look at this by card level and card type, but I\u2019m not going to get into it with you. But the reality is, in managing the business, I look at voluntary attrition, and that is down. And of course, in a situation like we\u2019re in now, where over time we\u2019ve been feeding the card acquisition machine, you don\u2019t feed it to the same extent that we\u2019ve been feeding it. And so it is down significantly, which is why you\u2019ve seen the marketing expense go down, which is why you\u2019ve seen us pivot our marketing investment from card acquisition to Card Member value and Card Member engagement. So I\u2019m not concerned at all about the proprietary card numbers. Those numbers will come back up as we turn acquisition back on. But I do \u2013 what I do watch very carefully is the voluntary attrition numbers. And Jeff\u2019s point is right. I mean we will cancel people because you do not want contingent liability out there in the environment. If they hadn\u2019t been using you before, more than likely you don\u2019t want them to be using you now.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.\nChris Donat: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the impact of bankruptcies on your financial statements. Some of the \u2013 now we\u2019ve seen some corporate issuers, and they\u2019ll identify American Express as a creditor. And we did see in the variance analysis in the presentation that you had a $53 million write-off for receivables for a corporate client. So Jeff, can you just remind us sort of how those flow like in terms of recoveries? Do they show up in different places in the income statement? And how do they typically play out?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. So Chris, the kinds of losses you\u2019re mostly referring to, which are when a merchant goes out of business in a situation where either the merchant owes us money or we\u2019re going to make good on certain Card Members who didn\u2019t get their goods or services delivered, those are generally not going to appear as part of the credit provision. They\u2019re generally going to appear in OpEx. Historically, that number has been completely insignificant. We\u2019ve taken some modest hits, in the tens of millions of dollars charges, in the last two quarters. We manage it very closely. The one larger number you talked about, if you \u2013 and very quick reading on your part to get to the variance explanation, you would also note that due to a little bit of a cork in accounting, yes, we had a $53 million loss with an international merchant. On the other hand, that\u2019s actually a merchant where we had some credit insurance, so we would expect to more or less fully recover that loss. It appears on a different line item in the P&L. So that\u2019s all carefully footnoted there in the appendix. So look, we work closely with all of our merchants. We watch this very carefully. But historically, these just aren\u2019t big numbers for us.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Craig Wasserstrom with UBS. Go ahead.\nEric Wasserstrom: Hi, thank you. It\u2019s Eric Wasserstrom. One question, Steve. Obviously, it was interesting, of course, to see the renewal with this \u2013 that you announced today. Generally speaking, as you\u2019re approaching these co-brand renewals, how and to what extent are the current trends influencing how these deals are being struck, if at all, differently from the past?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So look, we\u2019ve done \u2013 in the quarter, we did two \u2013 we did a renewal and an extension. We extended our Marriott agreement early in the quarter. And today, we announced the renewal to 2028 of BA \u2013 of British Airways. So let me just give you the context on how I think about these things. If I was thinking about these renewals and \u2013 for a 12 to 24 month period, I wouldn\u2019t do them. But I\u2019m thinking about this business for the long term. And in the long-term, these have been terrific partners. British Airways has been a terrific partner of ours for over 20 years. Marriott has been a partner of ours as they did the Starwood acquisition. We had Starwood for a number of years, and we\u2019re very happy about that relationship. And the reality is, is that this pandemic will end. And as I mentioned earlier, when I look at the Delta and when I look at the Hilton Card, these are cards that were actually performing even better than some of our proprietary cards, and the reason for that is you have two great brands together with great value propositions. So as we think about these renewals, we think about them over the long-term. We don\u2019t think about them just in a short-term period. And you see that in both of these renewals, there were upfront purchases of points, and that\u2019s a way for us to help out our partners but also to help out our shareholders as well. So these are, again, long-term partnerships that have tremendous value, and we look at them over the life of these deals. And over the life of these deals, these will be good things for our shareholders and good things for our customers. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s why we extended both of these deals at this particular point in time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, good morning. Steve, you\u2019ve highlighted the search for more kind of cardholder value in your comments. And we\u2019ve seen, for most of the card issuing banks in the second quarter reports and even in the Visa and Mastercard intra-quarter updates, the strength in debit. And I\u2019m wondering whether this isn\u2019t a time for American Express to introduce a debit card. To the extent we\u2019re in a multiyear search for value here, tough economy, doesn\u2019t that play to the consumer value proposition that could be with us for a while?\nSteve Squeri: It\u2019s something that we look at on an ongoing basis. Economics were a little bit different in debit. And so \u2013 and the value is \u2013 the value that you\u2019re able to put on a debit card given the economics are a little bit different. But we continue to look at ways to fully service our customers not only from a lending perspective but a transaction spending perspective as well. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to look at. And if in fact we believe it will add more value, then we will look to proceed. It was part of why we did our deal with PayPal to link Venmo in. We felt that while we didn\u2019t need our own debit product, the ability to have the transfer of \u2013 from Venmo to American Express and vice versa is \u2013 was good. And look, as we launch China, that will be both a debit and a credit market for us. So I think it\u2019s something that we constantly look at. And as you can see, there\u2019ll be two sort of flavors of that while not having our own issued debit card at this particular point in time.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Thanks so much for taking my questions. As you guys look at your billed business growth numbers versus the peer data, I think some of the spend growth trends reflect the prudence of your customer base to dial back perhaps some of their discretionary spending. Can you just talk about some of the green shoots, if any, as to where your customer base has been diverting their spending from travel to other categories and how that spending behavior may have changed on a temporary basis versus more permanent? Thanks so much.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. Look, I think that our spending base has been traditionally with \u2013 from a consumer perspective, more high-end consumer, more discretionary spending, more luxury spending. Over the last couple of months, it\u2019s been hard to do that. It has been hard to take those trips. It has been hard to even go shopping for luxury goods. We\u2019ve seen more online spending. Obviously, people are eating out less and they\u2019re buying more groceries and what have you. But we believe there is a pent-up demand within our consumer base to spend. I think what you\u2019re also seeing is lots of spending from our perspective in sort of home improvement area with people like Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot and things like that where our Card Members are spending. The other piece of our overall spending really is as you think about our corporate spending. Our corporate spending is down about 50%. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s traditionally the T&E piece. The B2B piece is still relatively strong. So I think while we look at it, we haven\u2019t really seen our consumers really break out a lot of their spending at this point, which, from my perspective, is not necessarily a bad thing because, number one, it gives us more opportunity sort of down the road, and we are more than holding our own, obviously, from a financial perspective, both credit and profitability, and from a card value perspective with what we \u2013 with they\u2019re doing. But I think time will tell if there are permanent shifts in spending. But I think that \u2013 as I said before, our consumers like to consume, and they will find other ways to spend and they\u2019ll find ways to get more luxury goods and things like that.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. And sorry if you\u2019ve covered this in the prepared comments, but normally, Card Member rewards kind of move with billed business, but this quarter, it was down a lot more. Was that just a product of just lower spend in T&E, which has higher rewards attached to it? Or is there something you did actively there to manage that expense? And also, if revenues remain weak for a prolonged period of time, are there other things you\u2019re looking to do to lower expenses?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. So actually, Mark, you\u2019re sort of dead on it. Normally, people should expect rewards to move roughly in line with billings. This quarter, it went down more, and that was driven by the fact that you\u2019re correct, the higher-cost redemptions are the redemptions that people do for travel-related awards. One of the shifts, just like spend, as Steve was just talking about, has shifted a little bit from travel into other types of spending. Well, so if rewards shifted from the higher-cost travel to other things, particularly some of the online things we do with some of our partners, and so that\u2019s why for this quarter, you saw rewards come down a little faster than just the billings. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d \u2013 I think that trend may have played itself out. We\u2019ll have to see.\nSteve Squeri: The other thing that we did about a year ago is we did a deal with PayPal to be able to burn points at every PayPal merchant in the United States. And so we were starting to see PayPal kick up, and it was all about providing our Card Members with more and more options for rewards. And so again, is that a permanent trend? No. But I think we were starting to see that. So I think we\u2019ll have a little bit more balance in redemption going forward as well.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to the line of Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes, good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Craig.\nCraig Maurer: How are you guys?\nSteve Squeri: Good, how are you, Craig?\nCraig Maurer: Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to Sanjay\u2019s comment and ask that you retain these disclosures after the pandemic. But just a suggestion. I wanted to ask if you\u2019re seeing any \u2013 I\u2019m trying to think through what retailers are doing now in response to what\u2019s going on. This seems like this might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for retailers to disintermediate their highest-cost cards, meaning travel-based rewards programs, and try to permanently push the narrative away from that. How are you thinking about that? How are you reacting to that? And are you hearing any discussions of that from executives? And then just a numbers question for Jeff. Jeff, what was the reserve coverage in the SME portfolio?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So Craig, I haven\u2019t heard any of that. I think right now, retailers, restaurants and anybody else is trying to welcome people with open arms. Now is not the time to be aggravating your customers in any way, shape or form. And I think when customers are coming into establishments, they go there with the intent to not only support the establishment but to have a good time. And I\u2019m not so sure they really want to be badgered or suppressed or anything else. I don\u2019t see that. I have not seen that. I haven\u2019t heard that. I haven\u2019t heard that from other card executives. And I certainly haven\u2019t seen that within our own portfolios. The other thing I would say is that I\u2019m not seeing a big push on store cards right now either, which is probably not the most creditworthy segment. So I haven\u2019t seen it. We\u2019re always \u2013 look, Craig, we\u2019re always looking for that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re always trying to deliver value on both sides of the equation by driving in high-spending customers. And I just think at this time, it\u2019s foolhardy for a merchant to sort of give their customer any reason to not want to come back to the store. So I haven\u2019t seen it at all.\nJeff Campbell: And Craig, in response to your second question, as I said in my remarks, overall, you had 8% of our Card Member loan balance reserved and about a little more than 1% on the Card Member receivables side and really reflecting something else I said earlier. One of the things that has pleased us in the last 90 days is that when you look at the reserve percentage on the loans side, which is where most of the exposure is, it\u2019s actually lower for SMEs at 7% than it is for consumer, which is a little bit above 8%. 90 days ago, to be honest, it was not clear to us that\u2019s where the trend was going to go, but that makes us feel pretty good. On the receivable side, on both the SME and consumer side, it\u2019s around 1%.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. Just one other point on that. There was a \u2013 early on coming out of the pandemic, you saw a group of merchants that we\u2019re adding on sort of \u2013 regardless of how you pay, they were from a 3% to 5% COVID surcharge. They were actually calling it a COVID surcharge. They got ripped in the press, and they got ripped by their customers. If your costs are going up, raise your costs. But don\u2019t surprise somebody at the end. So I think people right now are just happy with people coming into the store, albeit what that means, coming into a store, these days, whether you\u2019re eating out in the street or you\u2019re sort of dropping \u2013 drive by or pick up or shopping. So I just don\u2019t see that happening in the short to medium-term.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Thanks. So Jeff, in terms of the state disclosure, and you think about consumer T&E, how impactful is sort of your top one or two markets, New York or California, if we see one of those open up or slow down, just to get a sensitivity, what that could do to T&E?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so you\u2019re correct, the states we chose to show in the slides are our four largest states: Texas, Florida, New York and California. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given the exact numbers, Don, in a while by state. What \u2013 although I\u2019d kind of step way back. Remember, we\u2019re a global company. The U.S. is only two-thirds of the business to begin with. And of course, we are spread across all 50 states. So no one state opening or closing at various levels is going to have a material impact on our trends. The other point I will come back to, Don, that I do think is not completely intuitive to people is when you look at the varying rate states have opened up, there\u2019s a little bit of difference between states. If you look at that chart is New York \u2013 New York is still down a little bit more than in Texas or Florida, but it\u2019s a pretty modest difference. So the most important thing is more where is the overall global economy going, at what rate we make some real medical strides here. And our business will respond.\nVivian Zhou: With that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jeff.

Welcome to the American Express, Q1 2020 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Vivian Zhou. Please go ahead.\nVivian Zhou : Thank you, Alan, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.  The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings material, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's key priorities for 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide review of our first quarter financial performance. After that we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks Vivian. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today. First of all, I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this COVID-19 crisis.  As we said on our investor call on March 17, we're in unprecedented times. Our results in January and February continued the strong trends we've seen over the past 10 quarters, but we\u2019re now operating in a very different world.  The deterioration in the economy due to COVID-19 impacts that began during the first quarter and accelerated in April, has dramatically impacted our volumes. Looking ahead, it's impossible to know when the economy will improve. In the meantime, we are focused on supporting our colleagues and customers, while remaining financially strong so that we could be in a position to grow when the crisis ends.  Jeff will take you through some detail on how this environment is impacting various components of our financial results. My comments will focus on what we're doing to manage the company through the near term, so that we can be in a position to take advantage of the growth opportunities that will be available when the economy improves.  Last year, as many economists were predicting an economic slowdown at some point, we put together a plan for managing through a range of potential economic scenarios, and we modeled what our response might look like in those scenarios. Of course, the economic situation we're facing right now is nothing like those we modeled. However, we developed a framework that we're using to guide us in managing the company through this short term as we plan for the future.  Our framework for managing through this cycle is built on four principles you will see on slide two: supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, protecting our customers and our brands, structuring the company for growth in the future and remaining financially strong. I\u2019ll spend a few minutes talking about each of these principles which represent our priorities for 2020.  Turning to slide three. From day one of this crisis, our priority has been to take care of our people; the 64,000 American Express colleagues around the world. We wanted to ensure our college felt secure in their jobs, which is why we committed to no COVID-19 related layoffs for the remainder of 2020. In addition, we're continuing to pay the salaries of colleagues who are affected by the virus without having to use their paid leave. We also committed to paying all out of pocket COVID-related medical expenses for colleagues in our U.S. medical plans.  As the virus spread rapidly around the world, we wanted to keep our colleagues safe and secure, so we moved quickly to a full time work-from-home arrangement in all our locations, including thousands of our front line service collogues.  A core value of our company from our earliest days has been supporting the communities from where we do business and where our colleagues live and work. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we committed over $6 million in grants to the American Express Foundation, to a number of charitable organizations around the world that are supporting frontline workers in this crisis. We also pledged to match more than $1 million in Card Member donations to feeding America when U.S. Card Members use their membership rewards points to donate to the organization through JustGiving.com.  In addition, we're working with our partners to support our communities. For example, we\u2019re partnering with Hilton to donate up to 1 million hotel room nights to frontline medical professionals across the U.S., and we're backing Marriott's Rooms for Responders initiative to provide hotels [ph] for healthcare professionals in some of the hardest hit regions.  The next principle is protecting our customers and our brand. Our global customer base is one of our most important assets, and like everyone they're going through a difficult time right now. We're offering a range of financial assistance options to help our customers weather the storm adding new product benefits to be relevant in today's environment and continuing to provide world class customer service our customers expect and rely on.  Our consumer and small business card members are taking advantage of the various short term financial assistance options we offer to help them navigate through this period, including temporary payment deferrals, interest and late fee waivers, and protections from collection calls and negative credit bureau reporting.  We also offer a range of longer-term assistance programs for certain customers who require more time. We're expanding eligibility for these programs and enhancing them to provide for additional payment flexibility based on a customer's circumstances.  To enable our U.S. small business customers to obtain the financial assistance provided under the SBAs Pay Check Protection Program, we\u2019ve been authorized as an SBA, PPP lender and began to accept applications from our customers earlier this week, which we will submit to the SBA as soon as that window opens.  In addition to our financial assistance initiatives, we\u2019ve enhanced our membership rewards programs and we're adding new offers, benefits, and rewards to our premium products that are particularly relevant for the times we're in now. For example, since people are not currently traveling, eating out, or shopping in store, we\u2019ve adjusted our MR program to include discounts on Amazon when you pay with points, and the ability to earn double points with orders from GrubHub and Seamless through the end of the year.  We're also adding a range of limited-time offers, credits, and rewards on stay-at-home services, such as wireless, streaming, grocery, and food delivery for our consumer and certain co-brand card customers, as well as business essentials like wireless office equipment and shipping for our small business customers.  For our co-branded customers, we are also working with our partners to extend Card Member benefits such as airline companion certificates and hotel free night awards, so our mutual customers will have more time to enjoy these benefits. And for our travel customers, we are waiving fees for any flight changes or new bookings made through American Express travel, now through May 31.  In addition to our Card Members, we are supporting small businesses as we have for many years through Shop Small initiatives like small business Saturday and many others around the world. During the COVID-19 crisis, we're continuing to promote the positive impact consumers can have on their local communities and small businesses through our Stay Home and Shop Small campaign.  Earlier this week, we launched StandForSmall in the U.S., a coalition of more than 40 companies across various industries that have come together to back small businesses by providing a wide range of offers, complementary services, access to corporate assistance programs, and other resources designed to help support them as they manage through the crisis. We look forward to many more companies joining this initiative over the coming weeks. For our merchant partners, we are also temporarily extending the amount of time businesses must respond to disputes, and have increased contactless transactions thresholds to reduce physical contact at the point of sale in 28 countries.  Finally, our customer care professionals made a quick transition from a brick-and-mortar operation to home-based servicing one and we did so with minimal disruption. In fact, our servicing levels quickly came back to BAU levels and our customer satisfaction results improved during the crisis and are at significantly higher levels now than in January.  Our next principal is structuring the company for future growth. While we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will generate certain changes in our business in the near term, and likely over the long term, it will also generate opportunity, and we intend to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves. We are starting with the strong foundation, the access we have, our differentiated business model, particularly our brands, our customers, and our Merchant Network give us a great base to build upon.  In addition, the strategic imperatives we've been focused on over the past few years remain just as relevant today. While we make some adjustments considering the current environment, we\u2019ll continue to pursue our overall strategies in the following areas: expanding our leadership in the premium consumers space, building on our strong position in commercial payments, strengthening our global integrated network to provide unique value and making American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives.  As the crisis unfolded, we knew that we had to reprioritize our investments in each of these areas to focus on those initiatives that are critical to retaining our premium customer base and strengthening our merchant network, while at the same time continuing to invest in those areas that are key to our long term growth strategy. This led us to a thorough and thoughtful process to identify activities that we should stop, slow, accelerated and continue.  What we are stopping for the time being includes items that are less critical in today's environment, including traditional advertising, marketing, sponsorships and customer acquisition activities. We are slowing down the development launches of some of the new products we had the pipeline this year. We're accelerating investments in mobile, servicing and credit and collections capabilities that are not only important today, but are also important for our continued growth over the longer term.  And we're continuing our activities in a number of areas, including acquiring new merchants globally, our ongoing efforts to launch our new network in China, our network replatforming initiative, our premium product refresh strategy in both consumer and commercial, and continuing to integrate and develop new digital capabilities, as well as making longer term enhancements in our servicing platform and other key areas that are important for our future success. Finally, we entered this crisis with particularly strong capital and liquidity positions that will enable us to remain financially strong. While some of our expense categories such as rewards cost and the cost of Card Member services will decline automatically as spending declines and customer behaviors change, we are taking aggressive actions to reduce discretionary expenses across the enterprise by nearly $3 billion from our original plan in the areas I mentioned before, and we have redirected some of those funds into new product benefits and longer term investments I described a few moments ago.  Looking ahead, in the near term our earnings will be driven by the answers to two questions that no one can now \u2013 no one yet can answer. First, when and how strongly the spending rebound as the global economy recovers? Second, how long do the challenges of higher unemployment levels and small business shutdowns last, perhaps often by the record levels of government support, and what does that mean for our credit losses. Until we all get to the answers to these questions, we're reducing our spending in every area that doesn't make sense in the current environment, consistent with our intention to not have any COVID-19 related layoffs of 2020, and consistent with our intention of protecting our customers and the brand.  So, those are our principles we\u2019ve established for managing through this period in a way that will position us to return to growth when the economy rebounds. Without a doubt, these are times that are unlike any that I've encountered in my 35 years in American Express. But while the magnitude and uncertainty of today's challenges are more intense, the lessons we\u2019ve learned through other crises will serve us well as we work through this one.  As always, we\u2019ll remain focused on what we can control in the short term, while keeping an eye on the long term, and like before, we intend to come back stronger. Our teams are working day and night all over the world to help our Card Members and our merchants just as we have done throughout our history, and when this is over, we intend to be in a position of strength, ready to capitalize on the opportunities ahead, because we\u2019ve managed the short term challenges while remaining focused on growth over the longer term.  Thank you for your time and now I'll turn it over to Jeff. \nJeff Campbell : Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll take you through our results with more real-time granularity on recent trends than I normally do. To help you understand how our business is performing in this rapidly evolving environment.  Starting with a summary of financials, I\u2019d encourage you to look at slides four and five together. As you can see on slide five, while January and February were strong months, March was a very different month, and so the full quarter results are not so helpful for understanding our performance in the current environment.  As you recall, when we held our investor update on March 17, we said we expected first quarter earnings per share excluding credit reserves would be between $1.90 and $2.10 and that's where we\u2019ve landed. We also said we expected FX adjusted revenue growth would be in the 2% to 4% range, but we came in a bit below that due to spending trends at the end of March deteriorating even faster than we had expected, as well as some of our ancillary revenue lines coming in a bit lower than expected.  Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business. Clearly it is remarkable how much the world has changed in just the last month and half. What's most important as you think about the near term future is understanding what's happening today, and so we've included a different view of our billed business that our typical quarterly disclosures, which you can still find in the appendix on slides 25 to 27.  Instead, on slide six and seven we've shown you our weekly proprietary billed business growth trends through the latest date for which our data is complete, which is April 19. Looking at all this data, there are four key observations I think. First, the volume declines accelerated dramatically in March, whereas January and February results were still in line with our performance over the last few years back.  Second, T&E which was roughly 30% of our proprietary volumes in 2019 is down almost 95%. Third, non-T&E spending has declined more modestly. As you'd expect some areas such as grocery spending and some online commerce have held up quite well and even accelerated, whereas other categories such as other categories of more traditional retail have been much weaker. And fourth, you will see that our proprietary billings decline seen to have stabilized somewhat in April with overall proprietary volume growth down around 45%.  Turning next to loan performance on slide eight, total loans declined by 3% year-over-year in the first quarter driven primarily by lower spending. In today's environment where there\u2019s so many questions around credit, we felt it would be helpful to remind you about the composition of our loan book. At the end of the first quarter 70% of our outstanding loan balances were with U.S. consumers, 10% were with international consumers and the remaining 20% were with small businesses, almost all of which are in U.S.  Moving on to slide nine, we wanted to spend a minute focusing on our charge receivables, because in an environment where spending volumes moved dramatically, these balances moved dramatically as well. As you can see in the chart on the left, with only one month of spend declines, our charged receivables are down 21% versus the prior year and $13 billion below the prior quarter. This dynamic is important as you think about liquidity and capital in this environment, which I will get to later in my remarks.  Of course our charge receivables also have a different risk profile than our lending book, and even within our charge receivables book, there are different types of credit exposure, and so we've included a breakout of where these charge receivables come from on the right hand side of the slide.  Around 35% of our charge receivables are from consumer charge Card Members and another 35% from small business charge Card Members. The remaining 30% is from Corporate Cards, which have a relatively lower risk exposure.  Slide 10 then shows our tradition credit metrics for our lending and charge portfolios. The trends in both write-offs and delinquencies in the first quarter were solid and remained best-in-class in-part due to all of our risk management efforts over the past few years to prepare for an eventual downturn.  You do see a modest increase in write-off and delinquency rates year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to any significant change in credit performance. Further, we had to look at our TDR disclosures in our Q1 10-Q. Those balances are also relatively in-line with the prior quarter.  Now, obviously our traditional credit metrics all look fine because not enough time has passed for things to show up in these traditional metrics. What we are all trying to manage going forward is the collision of record levels of unemployment, combined with record levels of government support.  So turning to slide 11, you will see the total balances that are enrolled in our customer pandemic relief program, which we established to support our customers that have encountered hardship due to COVID-19. Since we created this program in March, we've had nearly 845,000 accounts enrolled in the program globally through mid-April, just a few days ago.  I\u2019d also note that over 88% of the U.S. consumer and small business loan and receivable balances enrolled in this program are from prime and super prime Card Members, and many of those Card Members have made some payments sense enrolment. In addition, we've seen the pace of new enrollment slow a bit from its peak a few weeks ago.  We are working hard alongside these customers to get to the best outcome for both our customers and our shareholders by providing payment deferrals, waving interest of certain fees, as well as protecting them from adverse bureau reporting and collections actions.  We are also working as people roll off these short term programs to develop new longer term solutions, as well as leveraging our pre-existing hardship programs to help them retain their membership, and to get to a good financial outcome. So one of the many uncertainties around the economic future is the outcome of those efforts, which will be one of the factors that influences our credit performance through this crisis.  So let's move on to provision on slide 12. The first point I would make is that just as our credit metrics were relatively unchanged in the first quarter, our write-off dollars were also in-line with our original expectations and do not yet reflect the incremental stress from the current crisis.  The growth in provision expense is all about the $1.7 billion credit reserve build, and the credit reserve build is all about the macro economic outlook as we close the books in early April, which was suddenly and significantly much more pessimistic than when we started the year. This outlook does attempt to incorporate all the uncertainties around the impacts of COVID-19, as well as any potential offsets from the unprecedented level of government stimulus.  So turning then to slide 13, you see that our reserves at the end of the first quarter are almost double the reserve levels we had on our balance sheet at the end of last year. The increase is from a combination of the $1.2 billion of reserves we built when we implemented the current expected credit loss accounting methodology, CECL, on January 1, as well as the $1.7 billion of credit reserves we added at the end of the first quarter as a result of the worsening macro-economic outlook due to COVID-19.  Today, our lending in charge credit reserves on the balance sheet represent 7% of our loan balances and 1% of our charge receivable balances respectively. So the key underpinning of these reserves or the macro economic assumptions that informed the $1.7 billion credit reserve build we took in the first quarter which we show you on slide 14.  As you know, we do not have an in-house economist and so we use an external provider and look at a range of macroeconomic forecasts that we weigh it together in our credit reserve models. When we close the books on the first quarter, those scenarios assume that GDP would be down 18% to 25% and the unemployment rate would rise to 9% to 13% in the second quarter, with a steady modest recovery after that.  It's important to note that the latest macroeconomic outlook today reflects an even more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP and unemployment than when we closed the books on the first quarter. If those forecasts were to hold or even worse by the time we close the books on the second quarter, we would expect to have another large reserve build.  So this gives you a clear view of the assumptions behind our Q1 reserve build, but only time will tell what the ultimate level of write offs will be given the completely unprecedented nature to global environment.  Turning next to revenue on slide 15, net card fees remained our fastest growing revenue with 18% growth in the first quarter. We expect this revenue line to decelerate less in the short term relative to other revenue lines based on our historical experience with strong card fee performance in the downturn, as well as the fact that we have roughly $2 billion of deferred card fee revenue already sitting on the balance sheet today.  However, it's also important to note that the majority of the card fee growth we've seen over the past few years has been driven by growth in our fee based portfolios with around 70% of our new card acquisitions in 2019 on fee based products. As the pace of new account growth slows in this environment, we would expect to see a modest slowdown in net card fee growth over time.  Net interest income growth of 13% was faster than the 3% average loan growth we saw in the first quarter, driven by a modest tailwind from interest rate reductions year-over-year, as well as continued yield benefits from mix and pricing for risk. The details around average AR and yield trends can be found in the appendix on slide 28.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we saw softness in some ancillary revenue lines, particularly from travel related revenue streams that are relatively immaterial and typically don't change much quarter-to-quarter, but we are down significantly year-over-year in the first quarter.  Turning then to the largest component of our revenue, discount revenue. I move you ahead to slide 16. As you can see on the right, discount revenue declined 5% for the full quarter and 27% in the month of March. The contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline billed business. On average, we earn higher discount revenues from our T&E merchants than we do from our non-T&E merchants.  So given the much larger declines we are seeing in T&E spends, the divergence in T&E and non-T&E billing trends drove a 3 basis point decline in the average discount rate in the first quarter and a 10 basis point decline in the average discount rate in March relative to the prior year. Looking forward, if the spending trends we see in early April persist with T&E spending down about 95% for the entirety of the second quarter, our discount rate erosion in the second quarter could be as much as 14 to 18 basis points.  Now let\u2019s talk about our expenses. When you think about our cost structure, you got the cost that come down naturally, spend declined and certain behaviors change, and when you look at the three customer engagement expense line shown on slide 17, you see this dynamic and the sequential change in growth between 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. One way you might think about this dynamic in the current environment is that our \u2013 as our revenues goes down in the near term, you could see about a 50% offset to the revenue movement in these lines.  Other expenses such as marketing and OpEx move based on management decisions. As Steve discussed, in light of the current environment, we're aggressively reducing costs across the enterprise. In fact we're cutting discretionary expenses through the end of the year by $3 billion relative to our original plans. We are also choosing to selectively reinvest some of these savings in initiatives that are key to our long term growth strategy.  Looking at slide 18, you see that the environment in March changed too quickly for us to see a significant impact from these decisions in our first quarter marketing and operating expenses. So let me explain how we expect those cost reductions to impact these lines from a year-over-year standpoint going forward.  In the balance of the year we expect to dramatically reduce our proactive marketing efforts and reinvest in the additional product benefits that Steve spoke about in his opening remarks, while reducing many other costs. As a result, I would expect our operating expenses to be down about $1 billion year-over-year cumulatively over the next three quarters.  On the marketing line, we are funding the additional product benefit adjustments that Steve discussed with our other marketing cuts. The net of the two should result in a modest reduction in marketing investment levels relative to last year.  Moving last to capital one slide 19, as Steve mentioned earlier, we are entering the current crisis with a strong capital position. Our CET1 Ratio was 11.7% at the end of the first quarter, above our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The sequential growth in our CET1 ratio was driven by the counter cyclical nature of our balance sheet.  As our balance sheet shrinks, with declining AR and loan balances in the current environment, our risk weighted assets drop according. I would also note that our first quarter CET1 ratio includes a roughly 80 basis point impact from the five year transition option made available under the fed rules delay any capital effects of CECL until 2022.  We repurchased $0.9 billion worth \u2013 $900 million worth of shares in the first quarter, that have suspended our share repurchase program as of mid-March and we do not expect to resume share repurchases for the time being given the current environment. However, with our strong capital position, we have the capacity and intend to continue to pay our dividend in the second quarter.  Turning to slide 20, the counter cyclical nature of our business is also reflected in our particularly strong liquidity position during the first quarter. Our cash and investments balance increased from $32 billion to $41 billion in Q1, driven mainly by the decline in AR and loans.  We also saw strong demand for personal savings deposits during the first quarter, even as we adjusted pricing given the current rate environment. Our personal savings deposit base is up 6% versus the prior quarter and up 16% year-over-year. Putting it all together, our capital funding and liquidity positions are strong and we have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress.  In summary, we are certainly in unprecedented times, and looking ahead it's impossible to forecast our financial results for the rest of the year without knowing the answer to the two questions Steve posed earlier, when and how quickly the economy improves, and what happens to unemployment in the pace of small business recovery. Until then, we're focused on supporting our colleagues and customers, prudently managing our risk exposure and expense base, and ensuring that our capital and liquidity levels stay strong, so that we can take advantage of the inevitable rebound for our customers, colleagues and shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning, and I hope you guys are well. I wanted to follow up on the cost production commentary, and I'm curious Steve and Jeff, you mentioned these are unprecedented times and a lot of the situation is fluid. I mean, if things continue to remain as depressed as they are or even get worse, how much more can you cut on costs because it seems like you are selectively still making some investments here. Is there room to take down costs further than you\u2019ve outlined? And just on a related note, as we think about your card product orientation being travel and entertainment driven, I mean do you see people sort of shifting away to other cards as a result and are there any proactive strategies that you can employ as a result? Thanks. \nA - Stephen Squeri: Okay, so let me \u2013 it\u2019s a very slick way of asking two questions, but let me answer the second one first. I think what's important to understand with our card base is that 73% of our spending is on non-T&E, and while you look at the benefits that we do have on our card base, what our card members really appreciate is experiences of all type, great service, and our brand, and what you'll see coming out in early May is actual product refreshes to a number of our products, which will infuse additional value in addition to the value that a card may have.  So, if you look at our platinum card where you have fine hotels and resorts and you have Uber credits and you have other travel benefits and lounges and so forth, you will see other enhancements there from wireless to streaming to maybe some other types of travel credits which can be used in the future over a time period. But I think you know what you'll also see in the short term is card members using that and using the points.  In the longer term, I think here's where our product refresh strategy really does help us, because we will continue to modify products as the environment continues to change and morph, and so we think some of those benefits will come back over \u2013 some of the benefits that card members use will come back over time. So, I don't think that we will see people switch products. And just a comment on the co-brand product, [inaudible] of our co-brand spend is off the co-brand partner. So if you think about Delta, you think about Marriott, you think about Hilton, it's all \u2013 it's less than 10% of that spending is actually at those properties for those particular things.  And so, what I would say is we will continue to evaluate, we will continue to monitor, but you will see value injection going back into these products, and historically \u2013 and these are not historical times, but historically there's a tremendous resiliency in our fee-based portfolios, and so you'll see a lot of fee base \u2013 you'll see a lot of value injection into those fee-based cards as I had mentioned before.  The one thing I will say, and then I\u2019ll let Jeff talk sort of technically to the cost. What I think is critically important for us is that we support our customers. I mean, you know I started out during this crisis. We moved rapidly to get our colleagues out of our facilities. Within a two week time period, we were basically 100% virtual around the world. The only people you'll find in our buildings today are security people and maintenance people, and not a lot of them, and so we\u2019ve rapidly moved that. Once we did that, our next focus really turned to our customers, and what was really important through this crisis and through any crisis, and I've talked about this over \u2013 you know over the last you know sort of 10 quarters or so, is that it was important for us to protect our brand, it was important for us to be there for our customers, and it was important for us to stick with those initiatives that inevitably would be important when this crisis ended.  Merchant coverage will be important. Our efforts in China will be important. Our platform initiatives will be important, and so while we are very focused on staying financially strong, we're also focused on ensuring that when this crisis is over, we have been there for our customers and are ready to continue to hit the ground running.  And so, we talked a lot about what we stopped, what we accelerated and what we've slowed down, and I\u2019ll tell you the $3 billion of cost that we cut out of our plan, and I've been doing cost cutting for decades at this company was probably one of the largest cost cuts that we've ever done, and this is not a run rate number. This was $3 billion out of the plan in the next eight months, and some of that money will be put back in for value injection.  So the reality is, is there more to go? It is always more to go; there will always be more to go. We decided to do no layoffs, and the reason we decided to do no layoffs is there's numerous reasons for that. Number one is the humanitarian aspect of this; number two, the disruption to try and lay off people in a virtual environment is nearly impossible; and number three, we don't know what the world's going to look like. And so, while we're not going to take layoffs off the table for the future, we certainly are taking layoffs off the table for the rest of the year.  I\u2019ll let Jeff comment on sort of the technical aspect of where we have it, where we have that opportunity, but you saw a large reduction year-over-year in operating costs and most of your models assumed growth in operating costs, so that came right out as well, but Jeff, let me turn it to you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, the only thing I\u2019ll add Steve is to your point you can always react further Sanjay to the environment, and we asked ourselves two questions on cost. We took out everything we didn't need to support customers as Steve said, and we let things in or we cut everything that couldn't be put back quickly or that we made sure we weren't cutting things that couldn't be put back quickly in the inevitable rebound. The other point I would make is we're not hiring people today, so the reality is when you have 64,000 people and you stop external hiring, with each passing quarter our costs will be going down and also with each passing quarter since you raised the question as what if the world really radically changes and stays down for a long time? With each passing quarter our view of what we might need to put back is going to change. So we will continue to react. So we should go to the next question operator. \nOperator: It'll come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: It\u2019s certainly good to see your billed business and growth stabilizing in April. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you know coming out of the crisis in \u201909 you guys took share. A lot of the banks were sort of in capital, were struggling with capital issues. Do you think \u2013 how do you think the competitive dynamic looks on the other side of this, and do you think that you can be opportunistic and take share?\nA - Stephen Squeri: Well Don, certainly that\u2019s the intent. I mean that's the intent as Jeff just said about not shutting down these channels. If you shut down completely your acquisition channels, whether that be digital, whether that be direct mail; if you start cutting your sales organization and so forth, obviously it's going to be hard to do that.  You know it's hard to say where our competitors are overall in their overall business. Our business is as you know very monolithic. We are \u2013 the only piece of our business that we have to focus on is the credit card business, whether that is a corporate you know small business and premium consumer. How this whole pandemic plays out across all the other aspects of the financial services industry is yet to be seen, you know what's going to be the impact on commercial length, commercial real estate, commercial lending, car loans, you know mortgages, so forth and so on.  Traditionally what's happened is we have bounced back a lot quicker. Our card base tends to be a lot more resilient and there is pent up demand for our products and services. This is not a traditional environment that we're in, but our intent is to come out of this very, very strong, with our sales channels intact, with our acquisition engines pumping, and actually to take share as we did in \u201809 and as we did after the internet bubble.  That's the intent which is why we're sticking with a number of the growth initiatives and more importantly while it's easy to cut back on merchant acquisitions, when all of this is said and done, people are going to have a huge pent up desire to spend and we want to make sure we're able to continue to provide the access to all the alternatives that are available to spend at a merchant \u2013 from a merchant perspective. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thank you, and I just want to thank you for the new slides. There\u2019s some very good \u2013 this is [inaudible]. So my question is on the loan, but if we see billed business at these levels, you know what sort of run option we expect and what are the implications of that for a need to maybe resume share repurchases to avoid getting too capital inefficient. \nA - Stephen Squeri: Well, its a good question Mark. I think, when you think about our loan book, there\u2019s of course a fair amount of just transactors in there. So I think you will probably \u2013 if the world stays as it is today, I see a more significant decline in the loan book in the second quarter. Depending on how the world evolves, thinking past that might expect a little bit more stabilization.  From a capital perspective, the thing we are really focused on is making sure we stay really strong financially, so we can be opportunistic about some of the things Steve was just talking about, trying to gain some share in the inevitable rebound or other opportunities that might come up in the current environment.  The last point I make is that does mean when growth resumes, the balance sheet then goes to the opposite direction and it grows. So we need to make sure that we have enough capital to support very rapid growth when the inevitable rebound happens. And so you know what does that mean for share repurchase? Boy, I think like so many things Mark, we have to take that quarter-by-quarter and see where we are. \nMark DeVries: Okay, thanks.\nA - Stephen Squeri: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. One moment. Mr. Shane, your line is open.\nRick Shane : Can you hear me?\nA - Stephen Squeri: Yes. \nRick Shane : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question and I hope everybody's well there. When we look at the change in reserve, under CECL charge was going to be treated \u2013 that was going to have a very favorable treatment and there was a pretty significant spike in the CECL, in the reserve this quarter. I'm assuming that that\u2019s associated with small business? Is that correct? And the second part of that question, is there an opportunity to move some of the charge product to pay overtime to give some relief?\nStephen Squeri: So you're correct Rick. That the charge reserves under CECL were actually to remind everyone a reduction from the reserves we used to have under FAS 5, whereas obviously the lending reserves went in the other direction.  You\u2019re also correct that when you look at charge and when you look at our loan book today, I think it's fair to say that the sector that has shown the most immediate stress is small business, right. You\u2019ve shut down small businesses and a savvy business owner is going to say \u2018well, I need to go into cash conservation mode and in many ways what our pandemic relief programs are about, is trying to help people through that transition.  And so the question really is how long do shutdowns last? Can we help bridge our small business customers long enough to help them resume business and we're exploring every possible avenue about how you help them with payment terms and fee deferrals, etcetera, to help them come back strong and help the economy grow. \nJeffrey Campbell: Yeah, I think you know the only thing from a small business perspective, these are people that are not used to being in this situation at all. I mean you think about every other credit crisis we've ever had, no one ever shut down \u2013 we never shut down the economy, right. I mean things got hard, things got tough, but we never shut down the economy and you know when you look at our small businesses and you look at sort of the credit profile of our small businesses, these are people that you know would have high FICO and you know their prime and super prime is well, much like consumers. And you know if you look at our programs that we have, the programs are one to three months of relief, then we have short term programs and then we have you know our longer hardship program. So I think we\u2019ll be in good shape there, because it's really getting people through you know this tumultuous period.  As far as the charge product, the charge product has a pay overtime featured; it\u2019s called lending on charge, and so people could use that, but they could also use one of our hardship programs, and I think one of the things that we\u2019re really focused on is retaining membership at the end of this.  So what is the carrot at the end? These are good customers who are in a bad time through no fault of their own and we\u2019d like to retain them as customers. And so as you look at our programs and how we're structuring them, we're also structuring them with a way to return to the franchise over time, so you know that can answer to your other question. \nOperator: Our next question will be from Bill Carcache with Nomura, go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning Steve and Jeff. Is there any indication that the customers who are filing for initial claims are broadly representative of the Amex customer base? There's been some suggestion that a disproportionate percentage of those filing are for example entry level restaurant employees who may not be representative of the Amex population and therefore you know some of the traditional relationship that we've seen between initial claims and returns only could break down. I would appreciate your thoughts on that. \nStephen Squeri: Well, I think Bill I\u2019d start by pointing back something I said in my remarks, which is \u2013 I think it\u2019s worth noting that over 88% of the balance is U.S. consumer and small business rolled into a programmer from prime and super prime card members and this goes back I think Steve to your point, but these are not people who are used to being in stress. It\u2019s just such an unprecedented environment, and so look, we'll have to see how this plays out. But these are you know good card members on the consumer side and thriving businesses, until they suddenly were forced by the government to shut down on the small business side, and that's why we're really focused on working hard with them to help bridge the current environment and also hopefully let some of the government programs kick in and help. \nOperator: Our next question will be from Bob Napoli with William Blair; go ahead. \nBob Napoli : Hi. Good morning Steve, Jeff. Glad you guys are well and I appreciate the call and all the additional detail. You know the world is \u2013 I mean the post COVID world is going to change I think, at least somewhat. I'm sure we've all been on a lot of Zoom calls or Microsoft Team calls or whatever, but you know business travel\u2019s been an important part of your business. I think consumer travel will return, but business travel may be less, materially less.  B2B payments, I think your involved in B2B payments and through several partnerships with the build.com or several other companies, MineralTree, etcetera. What are your thoughts on how the world is going to change and how do we prepare for that? On the B2B payment side are you seeing more demand for stuff like AP automation as well? I know it\u2019s a small part of your business.\nA - Stephen Squeri: Yeah, so it's a great question and you know we obviously listened to Ed Bastian's earnings call yesterday and you know what Ed said, it\u2019s probably going to take three years for travel to come back to where it is, and let's just put this in context I think, because I think that's really important.  When you think about our commercial payments business, the majority of our commercial payments business is small business, both in the U.S., international and middle-market and a majority of that is 80% non-T&E with a focus on exactly what you talked about. When you look at our corporate card business, our corporate card businesses between 8% and 9% of our overall billings, 60% of that is T&E. So you\u2019re looking at about 5% of our overall business, which you know drives a lower proportionate share of not only revenue, but net income as well.  I think that will slow down, but remember in T&E you've got multiple components. You've got restaurants, you've got hotel, you've got car rental and you do have air. And so I think we've all learned in this environment how to work virtually. You know it is amazing, we don't use Zoom, but we do use WebEx, but it is amazing to see everybody on the WebEx screen and quite honestly, I think there\u2019ll be more of that. There will be less of those trips that are needed and so I think you will see in an inevitable decline in probably air travel. You'll still see people making trips in car, you'll still see people going to restaurants, albeit restaurants will probably be reconfigured in the short term, but in the long term I think it comes back pretty much to normal.  And so when you look at T&E I think the travel piece of it in any of the appropriate stay and the meal that goes along will probably go down and it will be a little bit of a reset moment, but our focus really has been on large corporate and I've said this before, not a lot of people were so driving T&E high. I mean they were so looking to maintain T&E, to reduce T&E, and our focus with large corporate has been on B2B payments.  What we have seen, in this short period of time is more automation of B2B payments, it is a small part of our business, but with you know in a virtual environment it is gone up you know significantly. I mean not significantly enough to drive our overall volumes at this particular point in time, but it\u2019s amazing how much it's going up from an automation perspective with our Acompay, you know acquisition with our integrations into Bill.com and MineralTree and Sage and others like SAP. So I think you'll see more of a focus on that, I think you'll see more spending there, and I think you will see an inevitable decline in some of the Business Travel Entertainment.  I think the consumer travel will come back over time and I think the other thing is, I am really happy with sort of the co-brand partners that we have and you know Ed talked about this on his call yesterday and that from an airline perspective safety will be defined in multiple ways now.  You know safety was defined from a maintenance perspective, but it's also now going to be defined on how you treat your customers within the plane. It\u2019s going to be how you treat your customers within the hotel property, and I think \u2013 you know what I think about Ed and Arne and Chris Nassetta, we\u2019re of equal minds there from a way to treat our customers. And so I think you'll see a premium in this return actually to air travel and I think that plays well for our customer base as well.  And I think in this time, I think our acquisition of Resy is going to play really well in the short term as restaurants will probably reduce capacity, and will be harder to get reservations and we\u2019ll be able to utilize as we talk about access and experiences or assets to be able to help our card members get into and experience some of the great restaurants that are around this country. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse, go ahead please. \nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on that Steve, because I think that you know you made some interesting points at the beginning about issues around your co-branded programs and the spending being cut around. You know outside of the partner and the comments about you know \u2013 that you just made about you know, about kind being special and at the top of the pile.  But I guess the question I have is, you know the fees that you just raised on a lot of those co-brands, you know the high end cards. The actual benefits that the partner provides, whether it\u2019s Delta or Hilton or the hotel chains, kind of are going to be less valuable to people at this point. How do you think about you know what people do, whether they down tier or actually you know shift the spending to another card. You know how does that process work? \nStephen Squeri: Yeah, I think what you'll see in the coming week is you\u2019ll see other benefits that'll be added to those cards to sort of balance out the value. I mean look, we're very focused on it obviously to go in a blog. A blog is very focused on what is the value that you get for what you're paying. And so you'll see enhancements to those cards that are not specifically you know either air or hotel related, and in particular to those cards where fees were raised, and so you'll see extensions on benefits, but you'll also see other things that are non-hotel, non-air related which will provide more utility to the card in general.  I mean people have those cards to accumulate points for hotel stays, for airline and for so forth. But I think you know as I said and you just pointed out again, 90% of that spend is in other areas, and so what we'll do is we'll enhance those products so that the value propositions are more in an equilibrium to what the environment is today, and that's what we'll continue to do, which is why I think having built the DNA in the company now to constantly refresh products is very important.  And not just constantly refresh them on a sort of a three to four year cycle, but the ability within a couple of months now to add all the benefits and to add all the credits and other access and things like that will serve us well as we go through this. Because we're going to watch it very carefully, we're going to work with our partners very, very carefully to put those benefits that will continue to maintain the value and continue to maintain the price value that we strive to have with these cards. So I think it\u2019s a great question, and that's what the teams are working on with our partners. \nOperator: Question will be from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley, go ahead. \nBetsy Graseck: Hi, thank you. Good morning Steve and Josh. \nStephen Squeri: Good morning Betsy. \nBetsy Graseck: I know we spoke a little bit earlier about small business. It is the single biggest question that I get on American Express, you know ranging from credit quality questions to you know persistency of the business as we go through the COVID crisis.  So I just wondered if you could refresh, you know your comments with more details around the \u2013 you know how you see the credit quality, the different industries that are really dominating your small business portfolios, and if you could help us understand how long you feel your partner's are \u2013 you know your small business customers are set up to endure the shut down that they have to deal with. \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, maybe I'll start Betsy with a few comments and then Steve can chime in. So I am going to start by reciting for a third time the statistic I pointed out earlier, that when you look across both consumer and small business, because many of our small business card members or they run their small business on the card they still have credit score and personal cycle scores we can track. So 88% of those people are prime and super prime and I just think that's an important first thing to think about.  Second, we have I think a lot more diversity in our small business card members than perhaps many people realize. And so Steve you were just talking earlier about the importance of restaurants to our value propositions and our partnership with Resy.  If you look at our open card members, that\u2019s actually restaurants are fairly an immaterial part of the card member base and in fact the Card Member base is in some places you might not think about intuitively Betsy like construction, building materials, professional services, lawyers, doctors. And if you think about many of those kinds of small businesses, those are the businesses that are going to come back and thrive, but clearly when the government tells them you got to shut the doors they would be I think financially irresponsible if they didn't say \u2018Boy! For a little while I could pay American Express, but I just need to kind of hold onto my cash while I understand the environment\u2019 and that's a lot of the antidotal dialog we are having with our customers.  So we'll have to see. As we said all along, the question is how long this unemployment state, the astronomical levels it appears to be at now, and how long does small businesses stay shut down. But Steve you can add a little more. \nStephen Squeri: Yeah, I know. I think it's a great question and you know it's one that we look at all the time, but Jeff said a small percentage. It\u2019s less than 5% of our small business customers that are actually restaurants and when you look at sort of almost 25% of our small business customers, it's things like contractors, plumbing, electrical work, air conditioning all those things are actually still continuing today, maybe a more reduced level because people don't want other people in the house.  But those people are not going to go anywhere and they usually have a lot of low overhead, but they may need that three months to get through it, and when you look at you know business services, it's legal, it's automotive repair, its beauty salons, barber shops, things like that and you know a lot of those will still be there and come back as they \u2013 a lot of them are single proprietor institutions. The other thing that I'll point out about are small businesses. While we do have a very high share of the market from a spend perspective, when you look at the overall sort of loan books, whether that be working capital, whether that be mortgage loans, auto loans or small businesses have just their own loan servicing, we're probably less than 2% of the U.S. market when it comes from an exposure perspective.  So when I look at it from a credit perspective, I think you just can't look at the card. You need to look at the entire small business sort of ecosystem of what is out there and we are less than 2% of that. And I would also leave you with the fact, we are very, very diverse in terms of what our small business set is.  So we think it will bounce back, and you know we feel good about, we feel good about our small business portfolio, but it will go through like everything else. It'll go through a tough period of time until the world starts to open again, which is why we think our relief programs are ideally suited for small businesses. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS, go ahead. \nEric Wasserstrom: Great! Thanks so much. Can you hear me okay? \nStephen Squeri: Yes. Not clear, but we can get it. \nEric Wasserstrom: Alright, good. So my question is about the COVID experience, just doing the quick back of the envelope, from your ACL ratio suggests maybe an expectation around a 4.5-ish kind of percent of peak loss experience, and I'm wondering if you can maybe put that in context of past downturns. I think as I recall from your peak quarter losses in \u201909, something like 9.7, something like that. So I was wondering if you could maybe put that in context and maybe the broader question is, does this circumstance perhaps suggest you know or has it caused you to reconsider you know whether expanding lending is most value maximizing for Amex? \nJeffrey Campbell: So let me maybe make a few comments about the credit reserve Steven and then you might talk about risk management in the current environment.  So you know Eric, gosh, if you think about past experiences, the great financial crisis, I think it took six quarters for the economy to get up to close to 10% unemployment rates and the current environment in six weeks we appeared to have gone way beyond that. So that makes it very hard to predict exactly how things are going to play out. Clearly if unemployment stays at the level it is at now, then you should expect lifetime losses across the entirety of the financial services sector that are greater than what you saw in the great financial crisis.  On the other hand the government is throwing unprecedented amounts of money at things here; we\u2019ll have to see where that goes. I'm also not sure a peak write-off rates really made are a useful way to think about this, right. Under CECL we're trying to every quarter close the books and put on the books our reserve for the lifetime losses we expect for what loans and receivables are on the books, and that's what we did is we closed the books in April, and now we'll have to see where we are at the end of June, but I am going to close before I turn it over to Steve by saying you know unemployment today is worse than it was in the great financial crisis and worse than it was in any CCAR and DFAS test, and you've tacked on to that shutting down small business in the U.S. So we'll have to see how long that goes. \nStephen Squeri: Yes, so let me let me answer the last part of the question. You know is there regret to be in lending and the answer is no. I don't think you could be in a payments business without providing a wide range of services, and so I think our strategy of you know lending to our customers and understanding who we\u2019re lending through, I think that will play out for us well during this pandemic.  I think the other thing is, what\u2019s important to notice is that, you know you go back a couple years, we really started to even invest even more heavily in our credit capabilities. And you know so the difference between 2009 and today is a chasm. I mean, we\u2019re not even the same company as it relates to it.  When I think about what we've done from an external monitoring perspective, how we do modeling and risk assessment, you know whether it's machine learning and how we do more through the cycle evaluation, just our overall customer evaluation, our ability to flex up and down spend and lend capacity, the way we risk price and our credit collections capability are so much better including our hardship programs.  I mean we had no hardship programs through the great financial crisis and now you know we roll out the CPR program in a matter of weeks. We have other programs that are coming out in addition to our traditional hardship programs, which by the way we're not traditional in 2009.  I think the key thing as we move forward through this cycle will be our constant evaluation of our customers, our constant ability to modify the spend and lend that we have, and our credit and collections capabilities, and our ability to be able to talk to our customers to understand their situations and really work with them so that you know those customers that you know have the potential to be good customers when this is over, we ensure that we were there for them.  So I think, I don't regret sort of expanding our lending at all, and I think we are much better positioned, you know much, much better position than we were in 2009 and much better positioned than we were just two years ago. \nOperator: Our next question will be from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs, go ahead please. \nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning guys. \nStephen Squeri: Good morning, Ryan. \nJeffrey Campbell: Good morning. \nRyan Nash: Maybe just a follow-up on the last question. So you talked about 88% of customers being primed, super-prime, but Jeff you also mention that unemployment is higher than where we were in the financial crisis. So I guess, do you have any visibility on where job loss is across your customer base? How that plays into your loss forecasting, and I guess broadly speaking just how do we think about the relationship between job losses and unemployment across your customer base? Thanks. \nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I think we've said for a while, but certainly general levels of unemployment, while it\u2019s just one of many, many, many factors that influences our ultimate credit losses, it\u2019s probably the single most important factor. I think your question also goes to though, when we look at our consumer customer base, we would believe that the unemployment levels amongst our customers are well below the general levels of unemployment when you think about who's gotten laid off.  When you look at small business, you know small businesses, we talked earlier about the range of actual card members we have for our small businesses and there are lots of different industries, but you have probably a more representative sample amongst our Card Member base because we cut across all industries and if the small business gets shut down, that's a tough thing in the short run for them.  So we\u2019ll have to see how this plays out, but I think, I'm going to go back to where Steve kind of finished his last answer. We've built tremendously stronger risk management capabilities over the last decade. We have taken many steps in the last couple of years to tighten up our risk management practices and we go into this, I would remind you with best in class credit metrics. We think we have best in class capabilities and we think we have a customer base, both consumer and small business that absolutely is more premium oriented that should help us depending on whatever the outcome is here economically. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Maurer with Autonomous, go ahead. \nCraig Maurer: Yeah, good morning Steven and Jeff. \nStephen Squeri: Good morning, Craig. \nCraig Maurer: So, two questions. I was hoping you could update us on your U.S. regional exposures and secondly, in what I'm sure have been extensive conversations with Ed Bastian and others, you know can you provide a little bit of thought around how you expect travel to reemerge in terms of cross border versus domestic. One of the biggest debates we currently have with investors is the pace at which cross border travel can resume? Thanks. \nJeffrey Campbell: So let me quickly hit the regional one Steven and you can talk about travel. The regional answer Craig is pretty short, which is I think as you would expect, where our heavy concentrations of our premium oriented Card Member base is well places like California, the Northeast Texas. All places have been fairly significantly hit within the U.S. When you go outside the U.S., particularly in the big urban areas, the London's, the Paris, the Tokyo's.  So I\u2019d say we are right in the mainstream of the COVID-19 challenge when it comes to region. We don't particularly see any differences though when we look across all those regions and countries in terms of credit performance or volume performance. Its remarkably similar globally I would say. \nStephen Squeri: Yeah, so look I talk to Ed probably once a week. You know not only are we good partners, but we're good friends as well and I think he would tell you that you will see more emergence of domestic travel before you see cross border and the reason you'll see that is I think, you know look, I mean how will countries open up their borders to inbound flights number one, and how will the psychology work from a consumer perspective. I think there'll be a pent-up demand to do something in the summertime, you know in September, but I think a lot of U.S. consumers will probably do that, the United States may do that in the island. So I think travel will emerge more domestically first and it will internationally.  Having said that, I talked to Willie Walsh a couple weeks ago at BA and you know their flights to China are going back and forth and you know relatively full as those markets reopen as well.  So I think it's going to be, it will be interesting, but I think what is going to make the difference here is how safe you make your airline and how safe you make the travel experience. And you know certainly we will work with Ed and our other partners to do our part to help that, whether it's from a boarding process and he\u2019ll take care once you are on the plane, they\u2019ll do a fantastic job and he and his team are thinking about those things and I'm sure they will come up with a really high quality and premium product as they always do, so.  But I do believe a domestic will emerge more than cross border, and I think it'll take more time to get back to cross border travel, would be my sense and you know I think that\u2019s obviously a better question for Ed and the other airline executives, but we do have a sort of a dog in this fight as well, so, but I think that's what will happen Craig. \nVivian Zhou : With that, we will bring the call to an end.

After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks Vivian, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release a short while ago, we reported strong quarterly and full-year revenue growth and earnings for 2021. Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented colleagues around the globe. We also provided revenue and EPS guidance for 2022 and we announced a new growth plan that resets our longer-term aspirations for revenue and EPS growth, so levels that are higher than what we were delivering in the years before the pandemic. I want to spend my time today talking about why these results and our progress over the last few years has me excited about the future and our aspiration to deliver higher levels of sustainable profitable growth. As we've seen in our results for Q4 and the full-year, the capabilities we've built over the past few years by investing in our customers, our brand, and our talent are helping us drive share, scale and relevance that leads to profitable growth. And we believe that will continue as the global economy continues to improve. Our strong performance across a number of key business metrics help deliver revenue growth of 30% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full-year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.18 and $10.02 for the full-year. In the near-term, we expect full-year revenue growth to remain at elevated levels, reaching 18% to 20% in 2022, driven by the execution of our growth plan and the recovery tailwinds we anticipate from continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. We expect EPS of between $9.25 and $9.65 in 2022. As we think about 2023, the continuation of the recovery tailwinds could drive revenue growth in the mid-teens, which in turn should provide a platform for mid-teens EPS growth. Looking further out, as we return to a more steady-state economic environment, we aspire to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10% and EPS growth in the mid-teens under our new growth plan for 2024 and beyond. We've learned a lot over the past few years that we believe will help us achieve our growth plan aspirations. The business imperatives and strategies we focused on pre-pandemic, the decisions we made when COVID-19 first hit to protect our customers and colleagues, and our pivot early in the recovery cycle to ramp up investments in a number of key areas, all proved to be the right moves that have been good for our business. Most importantly, our experience through this period has reinforced our conviction that investing strategically in our customers\u2019 brand and talent is absolutely critical driving high levels of growth. We've seen that play out in the results we delivered throughout 2021. Our fourth quarter performance continued the trends we saw all year in a number of areas that are core to our growth over the long-term. Spending growth reached a record quarterly high, driven by continued increases in goods and services spending, which was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. Global consumer goods and services spending in the quarter grew 26% versus 2019. And we saw continued robust growth in small business B2B spending, which increased 25% over Q4 2019 levels. Overall T&E spending also continued to improve reaching 82% of pre-pandemic levels, driven by stronger consumer travel spend. Customer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above pre-pandemic levels. For example, retention rates in global consumer are above 98%, and for the second year in a row and the 11th time in 15 years, we ranked first in J.D. Power's Annual Credit Card Satisfaction Study of U.S. consumers. Credit performance also continued to be outstanding with key metrics near historical lows and our card members are building loan balances at a modest pace. Customer engagement with our products, services and capabilities continued at high levels in the quarter. The strong engagement, which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions, marketing and new digital services is helping to drive the results I just spoke about in billings and loan growth as well as customer retention and satisfaction levels. Additionally, our customer-focused innovation strategy, which has driven increases in customer engagement, has continued to attract large numbers of new customers. New card acquisitions reached $2.7 million in Q4, driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products where we saw acquisitions nearly double year-over-year. In consumer, Millennials and Gen-Z customers are driving the growth in acquisitions, representing around 60% of the new accounts we acquired globally in 2021. In commercial, Q4 closed out as one of the best years we've ever seen for U.S. SME new account acquisition. The momentum we generated throughout 2021 further strengthens our resolve to continue our focus on the strategic imperatives we laid out back in 2018. Expanding our leadership position in the premium consumer space by providing a differentiated and ever expanding range of services and lifestyle-focused value propositions. Building on our strong leadership position in commercial payments by being the key provider of payments and working capital solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, expanding our merchant network globally to give our card members more places to use their cards and staying on the leading edge of technology and digital payment solutions to make American Express an essential part of our customers' digital lives. We are entering 2022 in a position of strength and based on the momentum with which we exited 2021 and the opportunities we see ahead, we feel very good about the future. We believe that continuing our strategy of investing in high levels in our customers\u2019 brand and talent as we implement our growth plan will position us well as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to provide more details on our performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations for the future. And after that, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Jeff?\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results, the ambitious new growth plan that Steve just talked about, and what it all means for 2022 and beyond. You see the growth momentum that Steve just discussed in our summary financials on Slide 2 with fourth quarter revenues of $12.1 billion, up 31% and full-year revenues of $42.4 billion, up 17%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. In understanding our full-year net income of $8.1 billion and earnings per share of $10.02, I would point out that we had around $3.5 billion of significant impacts from items that we do not expect to repeat in the same magnitude going forward, including a $2.5 billion credit reserve release benefit in provision, as well as a few sizable net gains on equity investments. Getting into a more detailed look at our results, let's start with volumes. You will notice in the several views of volumes on Slides 3 through 9 that we continue to show 2021 volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019. There are a few key insights that I would highlight across these slides that strengthen our conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan. To start, we saw a record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2021 with total network volumes and billed business volumes, both up more than 10% relative to 2019 on an FX adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 3. This growth in billed business as shown on Slides 4 and 5 is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which strengthened sequentially and grew 24% versus 2019 in Q4. This momentum is from the strong growth in online and card-not-present spending that continued throughout 2021, even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. Importantly, this 24% growth versus 2019 in Q4 represents a cumulative growth rate over the past two years that is well above the growth rate we were seeing pre-pandemic. In our consumer business, our focus on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities is fueling the 50% growth in spending from our Millennial and Gen-Z customers you see on Slide 6, and spending from all other age cohorts also showed steady improvement throughout 2021 and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Our strategic focus on helping our small and medium-size enterprise clients to run their businesses by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs, is driving the strong SME spending trends you see on Slide 7. Global SME expanding particularly B2B spending on goods and services has been driving the growth of our commercial billed business throughout 2021 and reached 25% above pre-pandemic levels in Q4. Now turning to T&E spending, you can see on Slide 8 that it continues to recover in line with our expectations, with overall T&E spending reaching 82% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. We did see some modest impacts from the Omicron variant in T&E spending as the pace of recovery slowed a bit in December. But even with that modest slowdown, U.S. consumer T&E was not only fully recovered in the fourth quarter, but actually grew 8% above 2019 levels. On balance, the T&E trends we have seen throughout 2021 reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies, and we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in operating -- offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel. Finally, on Slide 9, you see that our billed business momentum continues to be led by the U.S., where spending improved sequentially throughout 2021 and grew 16% above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. International billed business has also shown continued steady though smaller improvement with spending almost fully recovered in Q4. Importantly though, growth in goods and services spending continues to be strong both in the U.S. and outside of U.S. So, what do all of these takeaways mean for 2022 and beyond? Most importantly, we expect the strong momentum in goods and services spending to continue given the investments we've made in premium card member engagement, Prospect acquisition, value propositions that particularly appeal to our Millennial Gen-Z and SME customers, growing our coverage and expanding relationships with key partners. For T&E, we expect the total global consumer and SME T&E spending will be fully recovered by the end of 2022 led by the growth in the U.S. The recovery will be slower for the International and cross-border components of the spend, we've also long said that large and global corporate T&E spending would be the last to recover across our customer types. So these spending types may represent a steady tailwind in both '22 and 2023 as they gradually recover. Moving on to receivable and loan balances on Slide 10, we are seeing good sequential growth in our lending balances that is led by spending. And so the portion of our lending balances that are revolving is recovering more slowly. Because our balances are spend-driven, we do expect to continue to see a strong rebound with loan balances surpassing 2019 levels in 2022, but we expect it to take more time for the interest-bearing portion of these balances to rebuild as paydown rates continue to remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base. Turning next to credit and provision on Slides 11 through 13, as you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables, write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time, but we expect them to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2022. This strong credit performance combined with continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook throughout 2021 drove a $1.4 billion provision expense benefit for the full-year, as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve releases as shown on Slide 12. As you see on Slide 13, we ended 2021 with $3.4 billion of reserves, representing 3.7% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic given the strong credit performance we've seen. In 2022, we will be growing over the $2.5 billion reserve release benefit we saw in 2021, since I would not expect to see reserve releases of the same magnitude going forward. In fact, depending on credit trends and the pace at which our balance sheet grows, it's possible we may need to build some modest level of reserves. Moving next to revenues on Slide 14. Total revenues were up 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, up 17% for the full-year. This is well above our original expectations for the year, driven by the successful execution of our investment strategy and it is part of what emboldens us to launch our new growth plan. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full-year, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we began to see in the second half of 2021. These travel-related revenue still remain well below 2019 levels, however and their complete recovery will likely lag and be a tailwind into 2023 along with International and cross-border travel. Turning to our largest revenue line, discount revenue, on Slide 15, you see it grew 36% year-over-year in Q4 and 25% for the full-year on an FX adjusted basis. This growth is primarily driven by the momentum in goods and services spending we saw throughout 2021. Net card fee revenues have grown consistently throughout the pandemic and for the full-year of 2021 were up 10% year-over-year and up 28% versus 2019 as you can see on Slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. As a result, I expect net card fee growth to accelerate from these already high growth rates in 2022. Turning to net interest income on Slide 17, you can see that it was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, as we clearly hit an inflection point in the second half of 2021. The growth in net interest income is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers that I spoke about earlier, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to high paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances.  Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022 and likely 2023 due to the slower recovery in revolving loan balances. So, to sum up on revenues. The successful execution of our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery momentum, you see on Slide 18. Looking forward into 2022, we expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% driven by the continued strong growth in spend in card fee revenues and the lingering recovery tailwinds from net interest income and travel-related revenues. The revenue momentum we saw in 2021 was clearly accelerated by the investments we made in marketing, value propositions, technology and people and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses at the top of Slide 19, there are a few things to think about. Most importantly, the investments we are making in our premium value propositions are resonating with our customers and this of course is driving growth in these expense lines. In addition, over the course of the pandemic, we added some temporary incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions. The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing expense line. Throughout 2021, we gradually wound down the value injection offers as our customers were again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, as well as with the new rewards and benefits we introduced through recent product refreshes. This is all a good thing in terms of our long-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does however mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. Putting all these dynamics together, I'd expect the variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 42% of total revenues in 2022. Moving to the bottom of the slide, operating expenses were just over $11 billion for full-year 2021 and in line with 2020. In understanding our OpEx results however, it's important to point out that we've benefited from $767 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in 2021 and that these gains are reported in the OpEx line. We also increased investments in critical areas of technology and our talented colleague base in 2021 and expect to continue to grow our investments in these areas this year. For 2022, we expect our operating expenses to be a bit over $12 billion and we see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to our much higher level of revenue growth. Last, our effective tax rate for 2021 was around 25% and I'd expect a similar effective tax rate in 2022 absent any legislative changes. Turning next to our marketing investments, we are making to build growth momentum, you can see on Slide 20 that we invested around $1.6 billion in marketing in the fourth quarter and $5.3 billion for the full-year as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.7 million new cards, up 54% year-over-year. Steve emphasized the critical point, however, that in particular, we see great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products almost doubling year-over-year and representing 67% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. Acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small business Platinum Card members were all-time highs this year with Q4 being a record quarter of new account acquisitions for both of these refresh products. Much more importantly though than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from these new acquisitions. We are pleased to see that the revenues from 2021's acquisitions are trending significantly stronger than what we saw pre-pandemic. Looking forward, we expect to spend around $5 billion in marketing in 2022. Turning next to capital on Slide 21, we returned $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2021 including common stock repurchases of $7.6 billion and $1.4 billion in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation. As a result, we ended the year with our CET1 ratio back within our target range 10% to 11%. In Q1 2022, another sign of our growing confidence in our growth prospects, we expect to increase our dividend by around 20% to $0.52 and to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on Slide 22 and then we'll open up the call for your questions. The combination of our pre-pandemic strategies, our learnings from the pandemic and the strong momentum we have achieved have all come together to embolden us to announce our new growth plan. What does that mean financially? In the near-term, we expect our revenue growth to be significantly higher than our long-term aspiration due to the range of pandemic recovery tailwinds that I've talked about throughout my remarks, which is why we have given 2022 guidance of 18% to 20% revenue growth. We've also given EPS guidance for 2022 of $9.25 to $9.65. We feel good about this earnings guidance, as the momentum we have built on the revenue side helps us to grow over the number of notable items that benefited our 2021 results that we certainly don't expect to repeat in the same magnitude in 2022, as I discussed the very beginning of my remarks this morning. Our 2022 guidance does assume an economy that will continue to improve and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. It also assumes that based on current exchange rates, we would not see a significant impact from FX on our reported revenue growth in 2022. In 2023, we expect our revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets to go to due to the lingering recovery tailwinds which should create a platform for producing mid-teens EPS growth. Longer-term, as we get to a more steady-state macro environment, we have an aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. In closing, we are committed to executing against our new growth plan and will be running the company with a focus on achieving our accelerated growth aspirations. With that, I will turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Alan?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nStephen Squeri: Hey, Ryan.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So it's good to hear about the better-than-expected 2024 plus long-term aspirations for in excess of 10% revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. So Steve, I would maybe talking -- hoping you could maybe just talk about what is allowing you to drive this better structural growth, is it the investments you're making, the brand resonating more with investors? And what are the key drivers? And clearly, you're investing heavily in the near-term, Jeff mentioned higher variable engagement costs. Can you maybe just talk about what should give investors confidence that as we get to 2024, the business going to be able to drive operating leverage versus historically a view of reinvesting a lot into the business. And just lastly, one point of clarification, Jeff. Can you just clarify the platform for mid-teens EPS growth, were you mentioning that you expect mid-teens in '23 or more than it was positioning you well for mid-teens within '24? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, maybe we work backwards. Steve, I'll take the last one.\nStephen Squeri: Okay.\nJeff Campbell: I think the language on 2023 around EPS growth, Ryan, is meant to make the point that we are certainly, given the tailwind is going to drive again very high revenue growth and that creates a great platform for steady earnings growth. The caution there is just, you still have some volatility in how credit reserves may play out. And so when you think about sort of the total level of earnings in 2022 and '23, I feel pretty confident. Could you have some result that moves reserve releases between one year and another which skewed the actual year-over-year growth number a bit, you might, but I think the core earnings power will be there given the high revenue growth that Steve is going to talk about next.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. But just to talk about the operating leverage for a second, too, because when you look at and Jeff mentioned that we had sort of the contract to operating expense with the venture gains this year. When you look at that, you will have operating expense leverage growth this particular year because you're looking at 18% to 20% revenue growth. And if you sort of normal -- even if you don't normalize it, you're going to have a much higher revenue growth and you will. So we're still going to drive operating expense growth throughout this -- throughout our journey. But let me talk to you about what gives me the confidence. And when I look at sort of what we've done over the last four years, where we are now and how we're exiting, what I would sum this up, is it's a combination of three things. It is the strategy that we put in place. It is the secular tailwinds that we have and the momentum. I'm going to start from the back and work my way forward. Look at the moment, I mean you've got 30% revenue growth in this particular quarter, you got 2.7 million cards that we acquired, you've got historically high billings growth. We haven't gotten into this, but we see travel bookings. When we looked at travel bookings in the fourth quarter, it was 24% up over '19. When we look at the first couple of weeks in January, we're 44% up over '19. So we have tremendous momentum entering 2022. And I'll move to the beginning go to strategy. We at the -- back in 2018 and I made this in my remarks, we talked about being the premium card provider. And I think the skepticism was from Millennials and Gen-Z, that skepticism from my perspective is over, 60% of the cards that we acquired are Millennials and Gen-Z in this quarter; 75% of our premium cards were Millennials and within the next strategic imperative was SME. We had probably the best SME acquisition year that we've ever had. We talked about our ability to be in people's digital lives with 31% online spending growth over 2019. And we had 16% online spending growth just over last year and look at what we've done from a merchant perspective. We're at parity in the U.S. and we added over 7 million merchants, just last year internationally, and then look at the secular tailwinds. I think the pandemic has moved online spending forward for three years to five years and we're getting more than our fair share and then look at our business. We're at 82% of the overall T&E business from 2019. Now, consumer is doing really well. In the fourth quarter, we were up 8%, but the rest of it is below 2019 levels. And so we believe from a T&E perspective, we've got more room to go. When we look at our, as we segment our card members, Millennials are blowing it out. We had over 50% spending from Millennials in our Gen and Gen-Z increased over both 2019 and 2020. And as we look at sort of our Gen-X is up and our boomers are not. And our boomers is traditionally the ones they travel and have money. And once we get from pandemic to endemic here, they're going to start traveling again. Jeff talked about modest loan balances that will grow over time, which is the comment he made about some reserve increases, but we're going to get back to where we were. We look at international consumer. International consumer tends to be a more traveling card member and that business is flat and large and global has not come back, and I'll leave you with this on large and global. People are skeptical about business travel because of all the remote workforce. In fact, I think business travel is going to be completely different. And I think as you have more people in more remote locations, they may need to get together three, four, maybe five times a year to come to headquarters or to come to locations where they never had to come to before. And let's face it. We all realize that there is nothing better than sitting in front of your customers. And I just came back from an opportunity at the Amex Golf Tournament to sit in front of a lot of my customers. So when we look at the secular tailwinds, that's why we believe it's not only doable but sustainable as we move forward.\nRyan Nash: Thanks for taking my questions and apologize for packing so many in there.\nVivian Zhou: Alan?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nStephen Squeri: Hi, good morning. Good morning to you, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on some of the opportunities that you were discussing. I mean when I sit from my seat, I'm wondering what type of penetration do you think you have in the U.S. Millennial and Gen-Z, the numbers you just quoted were very impressive, but I'm wondering do you feel you're at 90% of that market or 10%? Give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that. And in addition, on the SME side where you're the clear leader, where is the room for you to run? Is it by increasing the product set, i.e. the revolving line of credit that you recently announced? Or is it more in acquiring new customers? And really the question is what's the TAM and what percentage of that TAM do you think you have right now in the various customer sets? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: So let me start, Jeff can sort of jump in. Look, from a Millennial perspective, I don't know exactly where we are. But what I can tell you is we're not at the 90%. I'd be closer to the 10% than the 90% but Millennials and Gen-Z. So I think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of runway and maybe in Investor Day, we'll try and give you some guidance on that and we'll do a little bit of work on that. From an SME perspective, look, we are -- that's right, we are the clear leader from an SME perspective. And I think when you look at the opportunity set, what we've said from an SME perspective is we want to be the total working capital providers and so you look at what we've done. What we've done is we've gone out there and now we've created with the acquisition of Kabbage we've created our we have the checking account, we have the debit card, and checking account is important because that's where all the flows of money come in and go out. From a card perspective, we've always been in great shape. From a revolver perspective on the card, we don't have the same share that we've had, and so we'll push a little bit more on that revolver obviously on working capital loans and some of the other term loans, we will be pushing on as well. So we think when you put that together holistically, we have a lot of room for growth from an SME perspective not only in the U.S., but in international where we leverage our international corporate card business and our position from a small consumer perspective to go after it. So, we think both of those areas are still very, very right to grow.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning and thank you for taking my question.\nStephen Squeri: Hey Mihir.\nMihir Bhatia: I just wanted to ask maybe we could talk a little bit about variable expenses, specifically what I'm wondering is just your guide actually seems to imply a little bit of operating leverage in that line item for next year, which just compared to this year. And I'm wondering what is driving that. Maybe you can give a little bit more color on the internal lines within that, the three different line items in there.\nJeff Campbell: Mihir, I didn't get the very first part of your question.\nMihir Bhatia: I'm sorry, I am saying your guidance of 42% of what is like -- as a percent of revenue is like lower than 2021, right. So I was just trying to understand maybe a little bit more which line items there is that the business development line or services, like what would be driving that.\nJeff Campbell: Yeah, okay. I will start. So there is a few things to think about when you think about that 42%. Remember, to start with, we started giving you this percentage because it was an easy way in a very volatile time during the pandemic, to help people think about all three of these lines. As you think about next year, I'd point out a number of our revenue lines are recovering more slowly. We talked about net interest income, we talked about other fees and commissions and other revenues, because a lot of that's travel related. So in many ways, because spend has come in --come back more robustly because we are seeing great engagement from our customers with both our reward programs and our many card member services, those engagement behaviors are causing those costs to come back more quickly than a 100% of the revenues are coming back. So really in many ways, one of the reasons we're very bullish about both '22 and '23 revenue growth being above our long-term aspiration is because you have the steady recovery as the other revenues recover. The other thing I'd point out Mihir is that back to Steve's comment on learnings from the pandemic and the investments we have made in our value propositions are clearly paying off when you look at our revenue growth, when you look at our acquisition results, and when you look at our retention and so, Boy, I would say it is a learning for us from the pandemic that investing, as you see in that 42% is the right thing to do to create a great platform for long-term growth for the company.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Thanks, good morning, Steve and Jeff. So Amex was one of the few financials, if not the only to not cut its dividend during the global financial crisis. Steve how important to you is sustainability of the dividend, did that factor into your decision to increase it by 10% and I guess what do you view as an optimal level for your dividend payout?\nStephen Squeri: Well, what I'd say Bill is the dividend is important to us. It's important to many of our shareholders and the fact that we're raising it for the first time since 2019 is a sign that in our view, it's time to be on the offense again and feel confident about our growth. All that said, we have a long-standing policy of having a payout that is around 20% to 25% on the dividend. With the tremendous growth in earnings this year and what we expect next year or in '22, we fall a little bit behind that. And so we're catching up really to that level, but that's what shareholders should expect going forward. So the dividend will grow over time as our earnings grow. But you're not going to see it grow incrementally as a payout but I think you pulled back to the financial crisis, Bill, it was important to show the stability on and just the resilience of the company during that time and that was an important signal to our shareholders. I believe, it showed our commitment to it. So it's about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nStephen Squeri: Chris?\nVivian Zhou: Chris?\nChris Donat: Can you hear me?\nStephen Squeri: Now we can.\nChris Donat: Sorry --\nOperator: Donat, you seem to have some trouble with your line. If you could please pick up hand set, check your mute feature. I'm sorry, we've lost Mr. Donat's line. We'll go next to Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. I just wanted to kind of focus a little bit on the cost side. And then you did the revenue guide is very strong clearly, and probably $2 billion to $3 billion above where consensus expectations were for 2022, but the high end of the EPS guidance is kind of where consensus is, so it sort of implies I guess between credit and costs roughly $3 billion more in there, is there a way to kind of think about the big categories, so that we can have a better idea of how that you don't have that operating leverage post that comes through. Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, Moshe, I will admit you were fading in and out a little bit. So I'm going to take a shot and what I think you just asked. I think when you look at our 2022 EPS guidance, I actually, the first one, I didn't think it would be to point people back to the revenue guidance, right. So we're all about growth and growing our revenues in that 18% to 20% on top of the 30% growth that we just showed in the fourth quarter we think is creating the kind of scaled platform that is the best platform for creating value in the long-term for our shareholders. Second point I'd make, when you think about 2022 earnings is as I said at the beginning of my remarks, you had around $3.5 billion of pre-tax items in the 2021 earnings, that I don't expect to repeat. So $2.5 billion of credit reserve releases. I think we're closer to a steady-state position on that. Another $1 billion on mark-to-market gains on both our FinTech portfolio and our Global Business Travel joint venture. And so we look at our 2022 earnings guidance and see ourselves growing over that $3.5 billion, while making the investments that Steve talked about in customers brand and colleagues to drive 18% to 20% revenue growth, Boy, and we feel really good about that outcome. And we think it creates a great platform for long-term sustainable growth.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah, I mean, look, simplistically, take $3.5 billion off the $10.02, call it $6.50, call it $6.70. So we see it going from that number to $9.20 to $9.65 and as we've always said we thought we'd be at the top end of the range of our 2020 plan and the guidance that we've given use the top end of our range, as the bottom end of our range. So we think it's from a pure operating perspective, I think it's a lot of operating EPS in 2022, you guys can decide whether you believe that or not. But the numbers are the numbers.\nOperator: We'll once again go back to the line of Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nChris Donat: Hi, can you hear me this time?\nStephen Squeri: We can, very clearly.\nChris Donat: Okay. That's a good -- better thing I just wanted to ask around discount rate, if that factors in as one of the tailwinds you expect going forward as we think about the mix of your T&E businesses and the discount rates there and also with GNS and even online, do you pick up any tailwinds from expected mix shift in business with the recovery.\nJeff Campbell: Probably not. I mean because goods and services are growing so dramatically. Our traditional mix of business was 70-30, 70% goods and services and 30% T&E. We may wind up being at a steady state of 80-20. And so obviously as T&E does come back, and we're at 82% of where we were in 2019, that's a positive to the overall discount rate but goods and services tends to be a little bit lower, but look, at the end of the day, we're driving discount revenue here. And that's what we're focused on. And so we're very happy with the goods and services growth, in particularly, the online and what I would point out is not only is online growing but offline is growing as well, and it's growing tremendously over 2020. But when you look at it over 2019, I mean even offline retail for us is up over 12%, so you've got a combination of online retail up 31% over '19 and you got offline up 12%. So we feel really good about how our card members are using the products.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Bob Napoli for our next question with William Blair. Go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you and good morning.\nStephen Squeri: Hey Bob.\nBob Napoli: Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jeff. So, one of your competitors large bank I guess targeted lower returns because of the need for tech investment and to compete against I guess FinTech\u2019s or, but what is your thought on the, what kind of investment do you have built in. How do you feel about the American Express tech stack and the need to invest and I guess as it relates to maybe blockchain and cryptocurrency potential disruptors to payment rails and buy now pay later as a disruptor to credit cards.\nJeff Campbell: Well, that's a lot. Bob. Look, I think, and you know you and I've talked about this before. Look, we've continued to invest in our technology stack over time. And as you know I used to run technology many years ago and we've been committed to constantly refreshing our tech stack and making those investments and this year is no other, it's not yes, it's not anymore than it's been in years past. I mean from a tech development perspective, I would say we're flattish as we think about 2022 up a little bit here or there. And from a tech operations perspective, you keep taking advantages and a reduced cost and then of course you then pivot more money into cyber because that -- that's constantly where you overall invest. Look, as far as buy now pay later and again, I'd made these comments many, many times. I do not believe this is targeted at our customers. Look, we have Pay It Plan It and Pay It Plan It is, we believe an offering our customers the opportunity to be as flexible with their payments as possible, and it gives you the ability to pick your installments and pay it over time. And we've had some increasing usage here, but it's not a major driver of our growth, and if you look at the other types of buy now pay later, the Pay in 4 Gs, the reality is the charge card is almost a Pay in 4 because by the time you pay your on average you charge card off or your credit card and a non-revolve basis, you could be a 45 days anyway, so. And when we've looked at sort of buy now pay later and that target audience. It tends to be lower FICO, it tends to be debit card users and it tends to be utilized potentially as an acquisition tool and that's just not how we play our game. So I'm not at all concerned with buy now pay later. I think you know some successful companies out there that are driving some revenue and are driving a lot of volume through buy now pay later, but again. We look at it as an option with our Pay It Plan It and the nice part about Pay It Plan It is, it's not at the point of sale, because you can do it any transaction, it doesn't just have to be at the point of sale where not everybody has a buy now pay later feature. So that's that. As far as crypto currency goes, you know, look, we watch crypto currencies and you guys have heard me talk about this, we think about the spectrum of digital currencies, we think about crypto, we think about stable coins, we think about Central Bank digital currency and you know at this particular point in time, we view more crypto currency as an asset class. I mean you've just seen Bitcoin go from $68,000 a coin to $34,000 a coin. Currencies that you use in the payment space, that's a hard thing to utilize that way. So, and as far as Blockchain, look, we've got investments in Blockchain companies to be constantly look at Blockchain and figure out, are there use cases for us. So, and as far as stable coins and FTEs and things like that, we're partnering with obviously the NBA and Topshop and we'll look at ways to get involved, but as I've said, we're probably not going to offer a crypto card, doesn't mean we wouldn't use MR as a redemption option and I've said many times, it's a digital currency in itself. So we keep our eye on it, keep our eye on \u2014 buy now pay later in case that side changes, we keep our eye cryptocurrency in case it becomes more stable, but right now, I don't see it as an immediate or medium-term threat to our business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Arren Cyganovich with Citi. Go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your capital return plans for next year, obviously, nice increase in the dividend, but you're at your CET1 target or within the range now at 10.5%, where do you think buybacks go from here particularly since you're starting to grow your receivable balances by a decent amount?\nJeff Campbell: Well, we're pretty committed to staying within that 10% to 11% range on the CET1 ratio, when I talked earlier about, the dividend will go up steadily as our earnings go up. The thing to keep in mind though is that we pretty uniquely also generate returns on equity in recent years in excess of 30%, so we produce a tremendous amount of capital each year, far more than we need to support the growth in our very spend-centric business model and the balance sheet that results from that. So you'll continue to see a steady level of share repurchase from us each quarter consistent with that kind of earnings generation and that kind of ROE and staying within our 10% to 11% range. Clearly, the big catch-up, there has been in the last two quarters where you saw a -- what I will call above trend levels of share repurchase to get us right back down to that target range.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rick Shane with JP Morgan. Go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks guys for taking my questions. I mean one of the things that's come up repeatedly is the strength of the Millennial Gen Z growth, when you look towards your revenue growth guidance, how much is embedded related to the sort of life cycle of a younger consumer and the growth that you would expect there or how does that play out over time?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think when you see us very uncharacteristically talking about long-term aspirations in '24 and beyond, a key part of that aspiration is looking at the demographics of who we're bringing in and thinking about lifetime value of card members, right. We are a business with extremely high retention rates relative to almost any other business, you could think about. And when we acquire customers we are thinking about the lifetime value of those customers. That's one of the things that contributes to the excitement that Steve started the call off with when we think about the longer-term growth prospects of the demographic that we are increasingly bringing into the company.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. And this may be somewhat related question to what Rick just asked, if I look at the 2024 kind of aspirational growth plan, it looks like you're almost back to kind of a pre-financial crisis growth algorithm with a pretty healthy spread between revenue growth and EPS growth as opposed to like the years prior to the pandemic, there is a much tighter spread. Is that a fair observation. And if so, what's different. Are you expecting more operating leverage, is this higher return business you're bringing on kind of what's behind that?\nJeff Campbell: Well, maybe I'll start Steve and so first, Mark, I think I'd remind everyone out what we at the time we refer to as our financial growth algorithm pre-pandemic which we very successfully executed on for 10 straight quarters till the pandemic interrupted, was to have revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range and double-digit EPS growth. So we have much bolder ambitions now to be in excess of 10% of the revenue growth side and mid [Technical Difficulty].\nOperator: This is AT&T, we have lost your voice line, if you could check your mute feature. We've lost the host connection. If you could please check your mute feature please. Ladies and gentlemen, please standby.\nJeff Campbell: We have lost the connection.\nOperator: You are back on your line.\nJeff Campbell: We are?\nVivian Zhou: Yes.\nJeff Campbell: Are we back, Alan?\nOperator: Yes, you are connected.\nJeff Campbell: Okay. We have no idea why we lost the connection, which is a little unnerving head I've just started. Alan?\nOperator: You had gotten into a little bit. I'm not sure exactly how far you went.\nJeff Campbell: I want to start again. Okay. So sorry, so apologize everyone not quite sure where the tech problem is, we're sitting in our office in the Tower in New York. So pre-pandemic, we were at 8% to 10% revenue growth, double-digit EPS growth like clockwork. We executed on that for 10 straight quarters until the pandemic interrupted. We see ourselves being a much bolder aspiration now in excess of 10% revenue growth, mid-teens EPS growth and that's going to come after a '22 and '23 at higher levels than that in terms of revenue growth and that kind of revenue growth, gives us a tremendous platform for scale for relevance and forgetting steady leverage on the marketing line and on the OpEx line because, Boy, you don't need to grow marketing and OpEx in anywhere near those kinds of rates. So that's the math maybe you want to comment.\nStephen Squeri: Yes, no, I would just say, look, we've been on, you mentioned pre-financial crisis. And yes, pre-financial crisis, there were years where we were in excess of 10% revenue growth and then post financial crisis. I mean the game changed post financial crisis, not only from a competitive perspective, but from a regulatory perspective. And then we are more mid-single digits sort of revenue growth. But the other thing I'd say is we're much larger company right now as well. And so when you start to think about 2024 and you think about revenue growth, you are looking at excess of $6 billion per year in revenue growth. So I think when you start to look at those numbers and put those in perspective. In contrast, those 2 pre and post-financial crisis, they are quite different. But as I said, we have all the faith in our strategy in a -- look, in a highly competitive environment, but if you think about what's moving us as I started this call with what's moving us right now to even higher revenue growth in the next two years is the fact that we've got some catch up to do with our with our core business in the areas that I mentioned in terms of T&E and in loan growth and in large and global and certainly in international. And then as we move and get to a more steady state, that's what -- again just this reliance of the strategy that we've implemented and as Rick just mentioned and Jeff answered the question in terms of the lifetime value and the focus on Millennials and Gen Z and whatever the next generation is going to be after this, that's going to be a key to our strategy as we expand the universe of card members from a premium perspective. So you will see how it all plays out, but we are very, very confident.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for squeezing me in. And a question about the investment plan support thing that 2024 outlook and beyond, can you talk about the role of M&A tuck-in M&A or I guess I'm thinking more broadly about adjacent areas that you're focused on investing in as you build toward that kind of two- to three-year out plan. I think about things like Kabbage and resi like you've done in the past.\nJeff Campbell: Yes, I think, at least, I think the way to think about this is, look, there is no singular investment target that we are looking at, but I think you hit the nail on the head. We look at adjacencies that make sense. Then as we think about the strategies for the product, I mean, as we move into -- as we moved into a broader definition of how we were going to serve SMEs, the Kabbage platform made all the sense in the world. Look, you had three choices there, you could have tried to build it, you could buy it or you could try and partner with it. And so it was an opportune time and we were able to buy it and that's how we're re-platforming our SME base. When you think about what we've done from a consumer perspective and resi is a good example of that. Is that, you know it's an extension of our overall travelness of the product and an investment in resi giving access to our card members to dining and it's also a great acquisition tool for customers because resi is not an Amex only product, it has some Amex-only offers for our customers. So as we continue to build out the strategy, we will make those determinations whether it makes sense for us to build it ourselves, partner or buy it and we'll tuck those things in if and when they when they make sense and if the overall price is right. So that's how we'll think about it, but you know just bring you back to the four strategic imperatives that we have, which is continuing to be the best premium card provider for consumer, looking at being that working capital provider for SME, becoming even more digital to our customers and adding more and more merchants and as things make sense along that strategic continuum, we will act if appropriate.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti: Hey, good morning. Good to see -- EPS. I don't know, can you guys hear me?\nJeff Campbell: Yes, yes, we can hear you, Don.\nDon Fandetti: Okay. All right. Good to see the mid-teens growth '24 and beyond. I mean I think we all sort of think of low double digits. Good to see. I guess. Steve, could you dig in a little bit on January and December Omicron slowdown. And maybe just talk about, did you see it dip, what kind of dip and has it stabilized. Just to give us some comfort on where things are.\nStephen Squeri: You know, for us, I think one of the -- most leading -- the biggest leading indicator for us of what's going on is how people want to travel, right, because as we know, people have shopped online. We haven't seen much of a slowdown from a goods and services perspective, what really is the delineating factor is are people out and about, and we talked about the fourth quarter as being 24% up from a travel bookings perspective. However, the last few weeks of December, we did see slowdown in terms of some of our travel bookings as people got and rightfully so a little Omicron, nervous, but the first two weeks in January, our travel bookings are up 44% over 2019. So what that tells me is people are ready to get out and get out and about again and we'll see when Omicron peaks and when we get the next variant. But I think society is learning how to deal with this. And as Ed Bastian said on his earnings call, I think we will ultimately move from pandemic to endemic and we'll learn how to deal with this. So we really haven't seen a slowdown in our billings at all. In fact, we've seen an acceleration in travel bookings. So that gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing I would say though is that remember from a consumer perspective, we're back, I mean from a T&E perspective, we were at -- we were up 8% over 2019 from a consumer perspective in the fourth quarter and we anticipate that moving further north. \nOperator: Our final question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks, good morning. I want to ask the aspirational guidance or long-term aspirational question again. But if we think about sort of the long-term revenue algorithm, right, is there anything that you're seeing inside your customer base, whether it'd be higher unit economics on the new accounts or evolving mix shift from different businesses, that's going to drive that above average revenue growth relative to history, I guess it would be good, and maybe this is an Investor Day thing, if you could, to just understand sort of what the key drivers will be as we look out, whether it'd be the baseline for economic growth versus share shift versus the different segments, right, like B2B et cetera. Yes, I don't know -- that's an open-ended question, but I'm just curious about your response to it.\nStephen Squeri: Yes, I got it. All right, you help us a little bit what our outline for Investor Day. Thank you. But you know, look, I think one of the things that people don't take into account when thinking about future revenue growth is retention of card members. One of the big drivers of our growth has been the fact that it's a lot easier when you keep onto your card members who are with you and spending and so forth and retention of card members, is at an all-time high. The other thing that's driving this is obviously the shift from a goods and services perspective, I mean, look, we grew -- we had more billings in 2021 than we had in the history of the company and we're at 82% of our overall T&E billings in 2019 and theoretically we're known as a T&E product, right. So I think we'll talk about this, but I think there are a number of things. I think it's retention. I think as Jeff mentioned before in response to Rick's question the lifetime value of card members obviously getting card members earlier in their life, you're going to keep them longer especially if you have the retention rates that we have. We'll continue from an SME perspective to above our product set and if evolve our revenues and we'll continue to bring loan balances back to -- we were above average industry growth from a loan balances perspective and we think we'll get back there. So look, we'll give you some more insight on that, but I think those sort of from a high level perspective, those are the things that give us all the confidence in the world.\nVivian Zhou: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Earlier today, we reported third quarter revenues as 10.9 billion up 25% over last year's third quarter, and earnings per share of $2.27. These strong results once again reflect accelerating momentum in our core business as billings on our network reached record highs for the third quarter, driven by goods and services spending.  In my remarks this morning, I want to put into context the decisions that we've made, pre -pandemic, when the pandemic hit, and during the pandemic to drive the growth we are now seeing, and the increased confidence we now have in our business model. In 2018, we introduced the new financial growth algorithm, which call for high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth. Prior to the pandemic, we achieved those objectives for 10 straight quarters through focused and increased investment levels in our business.  We executed strategies for profitably growing the business which were based on initiatives to attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers in both our consumer and commercial businesses. And while our differentiated business model gave us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities we saw, we also knew that the favorable economic conditions we had at the time could change.  So we also developed a plan for winning through the down cycle that's focused on protecting our customers and our colleagues and maintaining our capital strength while investing strategically and at the right time to rebuild momentum so we could win during the recovery. Through it at all the driving force behind everything we do from product innovations to our investments decisions is to continue to make the American Express brand special and back our customers. Over the last several years, we focused our strategies on broadening the appeal of core products to attract new customers particularly Millennial and Gen Z customers, as well as expanding our leadership position with SME customers by providing more ways to help them manage and grow their businesses. To accomplish those objectives, we made a series of investments and I'll highlight a few.  We put in place a strategy for consistently refreshing our core premium products, adding value with expanded and relevant new benefits targeted at key consumer and small business customers, and we charged for that added value. We added a host of new digital capabilities for consumers and small businesses and expanded and enhanced our mobile app to appeal to the digital lifestyles of our target customers. We're an early mover in launching our Buy Now, Pay Later capability pay with Plan It, which we introduced to address the evolving borrowing preferences of our customers. We increased our focus on working with strategic partners to help us enrich our value propositions, expand our network and broaden our digital capabilities and offerings.  For example, we negotiated wide ranging long-term agreements with key co-brand partners such as Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We also expanded partnerships with digital giants such as PayPal and added a variety of new partners to our ecosystem, including fintechs such as Bill.com and Better, and lifestyle brands such as Equinox. We achieved virtual parity coverage in the US and we increased coverage internationally through a more targeted approach while increasing the number of compelling offers and benefits that our merchants delivered to our card members. When the pandemic hit unexpectedly in early 2020, we responded by activating our plan for winning through the cycle using the same customer-focused approach to concentrate on retaining our customers and addressing their immediate needs.  We move quickly to enhance and expand our financial relief programs to assist our customers who suddenly faced financial hardships. Our frontline servicing team stepped up to ensure we continue to provide the world-class service our customers have come to expect from American Express. We pivoted value propositions of several of our premium products, adding temporary benefits on categories that were relevant to how customer spending behaviors have changed, such as wireless streaming, food delivery, and others. This has produced lasting behavioral changes as spending in a number of these categories, including wireless and streaming has proven to be sustainable.  Soon after, we turned our attention to small businesses who needed help by launching the largest global small business campaign in the Company's history, creating a stand for small coalition and supporting minority-owned small businesses in the U.S.. As last year progressed we learned from our customers what resonated with them and in this unprecedented environment. And we grew more confident to seize the growth opportunities we saw emerging. So we ramp ed up our investments in card member acquisitions and value proposition innovations to capitalize on those opportunities and start rebuilding of our growth momentum. We also saw an opportunity to accelerate our strategy to bring new digital beyond the card capabilities to our small business customers and acquired Kabbage, one of the leading providers in digital cash management platforms.  Importantly, the increasing demand we are seeing for our products and what we learned from the early value proposition enhancements encouraged us to restart our product refresh strategy last year. And in July, we launched a new consumer platinum card in the U.S. We're repeating this customer-lead product innovation strategy with the refresh of the U.S. Business Platinum Card which we launched last week.  As with the consumer card refresh, the new benefits we added to our Business Platinum in key spend categories such as electronics, software, shipping, wireless, and others were informed by our card member desires. Coming into 2021, we are emboldened by the strong results we were seeing toward the end of 2020 from our customer retention and acquisition efforts. And we decided to double down on our investments in marketing, product innovations, technology, and people to accelerate our growth momentum.  All these decisions, those that we made before the pandemic, when the pandemic hit, and through this year, as conditions began to improve, are driving the results we're seeing today. For example, customer acquisition to gain momentum over the last 5 quarters with 2.6 million new cards enforced in the third quarter. Demand for our premium fee-based products has been particularly robust with acquisitions of our U.S. consumer and small business platinum and gold cards reaching all-time highs in the quarter.  In consumer, Millennial and Gen-Z customers have driven this growth with 75% of new U.S. gold and platinum consumer cards coming from these customers. In commercial, we had one of the best quarters ever, the U.S. small business card acquisitions. Our focus on meeting the needs of SMEs and Millennial and Gen-Z consumer customers has resulted in these groups being the most resilient throughout the pandemic, leading the growth in spending.  In fact, spending from these groups continue to accelerate in the third quarter with goods and services spending for SMEs growing 21% above 2019 levels, and overall spending for Millennial and Gen Z customers, particularly strong up 38% over 2019 levels. Our initiatives to protect our customers at the beginning of the pandemic h as driven retention and satisfaction metrics higher than pre -pandemic levels and the digital capabilities we've introduced has driven steady increases in digital engagement.  For example, approximately 85% of active card members are digitally engaged with us. And we had the highest ever daily active user engagement across the web and mobile in August with a nearly 17% increase year-over-year. This example show the strategies we implemented to profitably grow our business before the pandemic began, coupled with the decisions we made in executing our strategy to manage through the pandemic and to win during the recovery have generated strong consistent momentum as the environment continues to improve.  And what we've learned through this past year is informing our strategy for investing to profitably grow our business moving forward. Looking ahead, we're operating from position of strength and we see even more opportunities to build on the momentum we've created. So we will continue to invest strategically in seeking to drive even higher levels of sustainable long-term revenue and EPS growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss our third quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions. Thank you.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our third quarter results, which reflects strong momentum in our core business driven by the investment strategy that Steve just spoke about. You see this momentum in our summary financials on Slide 2 with third quarter revenues of $10.9 billion up 24% year-over-year on an FX, adjusted basis, third quarter net income of $1.8 billion in earnings per share of $2.27.  To get right into a more detailed look at our results, let's talk about how the strategies that Steve just discussed, have helped to drive our volumes back above pre -pandemic levels, as you can see on Slide 3. You've all noticed in the several views of volumes that begin on Slide 3 that we continue to show third quarter volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 as we find, it's provides a clearer picture of the progress we're making in building growth momentum. We did see continued momentum and spending volumes in the third quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes both up around 30% year-over-year and up 4% relative to 2019 on an FX adjusted basis. This growth in billed business is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which you can see on Slide 4, represents 79% of our overall build business and was up 19% versus 2019 and strengthened sequentially versus Q2.  We are very pleased with this continued strength in goods and services spending given the investments we've made in premium card member engagement, prospect acquisition, growing our coverage, and expanding relationships for the key partners. Focusing in first on our consumer business on Slide 5 overall spending was 9% above 2019 levels as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 20% above 2019 in the third quarter. For many years, we've been focused on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of card members through expanding our value propositions in digital capabilities.  Aided by these efforts, you see that Millennials and Gen Z customers are leading the growth in spending reaching 38% above 2019 levels for the quarter. Older age cohorts have shown continued steady though smaller improvement as well. Turning to our commercial business, as you know, we've been very focused on helping our small and medium-sized enterprise clients run their business by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments for working capital needs.  This strategic focus on SMEs has been key in driving the performance you see on slide 6. Global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial build business, remain the most resilient across all of our customer types with spending up 11% versus 2019 driven by strong growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which grew 21% above 2019 levels in Q3. In contrast, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery.  We've said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. Digging into goods and services, spending trends on Slide 7, we continue to see strong growth in online and card-not-present spending, which was up 27% versus 2019, even as offline spending fully recovered in the third quarter, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. We also saw growth across all categories of goods and services spending with both consumer and SMEs driving the strong growth in retail and wholesale spending, And SMEs leading the growth in advertising and media spending. Turning now to T&E spending on Slide 8, you continue to see a recovery that is on track with our expectation that were reached 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. T&E spending improved sequentially versus Q2, and we're pleased to see restaurant spending, our most resilient and now largest T&E category, back above pre -pandemic levels in the quarter.  We did see some modest impacts from the Delta variant in the airline category, where the pace of recovery slowed a bit in August, but it has strengthened again in September and into early October. The trends we have seen reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies. And we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our consumer and commercial customers as they return to travel.  Turning to our last look at volumes on slide 9, you do see that the overall billed business volume recovery continues to be led by the U.S., which first surpassed 2019 levels in Q2 and was up 9% in the third quarter. Importantly though, growth in goods and services spending has been strong bull in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spending is only weaker outside the U.S. because, historically, we have more travel-related spending in our air -- in our international regions. And international T&E is recovering more slowly than in the U.S. given cross-border travel restrictions. Looking ahead, based on current trends, we still assume that overall T&E spending globally will recover to around 80% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter of 2021.  And even more importantly, we expect continued strong growth momentum in goods and services spending. So all in all, a really good story on spending volumes. Moving on then to the receivable and loan balances on Slide 10, loan balances continue to slowly recover in the third quarter and were up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Relative to 2019 though, loan balances remained down 10% as we continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I will talk about in a moment.  I would point out that we have hit an inflection point on revolving loan balances and will take time for those balances to be build as paydown rates are likely to remain elevated in the near-term. We believe over the long term, we can get back to growing our loan volumes faster in the industry. For the next few quarters though, I continue to expect the recovery in loan balances to lag the recovery and spending volumes. Turning next to credit and provision on slides 11 through 13, as you flip through these slides there are a few key points I'd like you to takeaway. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables, write-off, and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows.  As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency in loss rates to slowly move up over time. However, given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off rates in the next few quarters. This strong credit performance combined with further improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, drove $191 million provision expense benefit in the third quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release as shown on Slide 12. That said, we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus in the industry forbearance programs have yet to roll-off and that there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment.  In addition, we are closely monitoring how the card members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, though the early performance of the card members that have exited these programs has looked quite strong. As you see on Slide 13, we ended the quarter -- third quarter with $3.6 billion of reserves representing 4.5% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances, respectively, which is only slightly below the reserve levels we had pre -pandemic.  So given that our credit metrics are still around historical lows, I would say that we continue to hold an appropriately significant amount of reserves driven by the remaining uncertainties I just spoke about. Moving next to revenues on Slide 14, total revenues were up 25% year-over-year in the third quarter. We had double-digit growth in all of our non-interest revenue lines and we are starting to see growth in net interest income as well. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we're beginning to see, though they still remain well below 2019 levels.  Turning to our largest revenue line discount revenue on slide 15, you see it grew 33% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis and is now comfortably above 2019 levels. This growth is primarily driven by the steady momentum in goods and services spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net current fee revenues continue to grow as consistently as they have throughout the entire pandemic, up 27% year-over-year in the third quarter. These card fee revenues are now 27% higher than they were back in the third quarter of 2019 as you can see on Slide 16. The resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. Turning to net interest income on Slide 17, you can see that it was up 6% year-over-year, though still growing slower relative to the other revenue lines, we have clearly hit an inflection point.  This growth is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs into higher paydown rates. They're driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. We did see a modest sequential improvement in revolving loan balances in the third quarter. But looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes.  So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q3 as you can see on slide 18 with revenue up 24% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Looking forward, with the strength in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first three quarters of the year, we now assume that full-year revenue growth could be around 15% if current trends continue. The revenue momentum we've seen this year has clearly been accelerated as a result of the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, technology and people, and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19.  Let me start at the bottom with operating expenses, which were up 3% year-over-year in the third quarter. Looking forward, I still expect our full-year OPEX to be below the $11.5 billion we originally expected, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing in technology and our people to drive long-term growth in our business. Moving on to variable customer engagement expenses at the top of slide 19, there are a few things to think about. Most importantly, in 2020 we added some incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection, because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions.  The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing investment line and are now winding down. We are able to wind them down because our customers are, again, engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions, which is a good thing in terms of longer-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does, however, mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. As one example of the financial implications of customers again engaging in travel-related aspects of our membership rewards program, in the rewards line we made a roughly $200 million adjustment this quarter to our membership rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel related categories.  Looking forward, as I've said the past few quarters, I'd expect these variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 40% of total revenues. Turning next to the marketing investments, we're making the build growth momentum. You can see on Slide 20 that we invested $1.4 billion in marketing in the third quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisition while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.6 million new cards, up 87% year-over-year and 6% sequentially in the third quarter.  Much more importantly though, than just the total number of cards, we focused internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from new acquisitions and revenues from this quarter's acquisitions are trending stronger than what we saw pre -pandemic. One key driver of this performance is a great demand for our premium fee-based products. With new accounts acquired on these products more than doubling year-over-year and representing 65% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. In particular, acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small business platinum and gold Card members were at all-time highs this quarter. And this was, again, one of the best quarters for small business new account acquisitions in the U.S. Based on the opportunities we've seen in the first three quarters of 2021, we now expect to invest over $5 billion in marketing for the year.  We feel really good about the results we've seen from our strategic investments, and see an opportunity to continue to invest during the recovery to maximize sustainable long-term growth. Turning next to capital on slide 21, our CET1 ratio was 12.6% at the end of the third quarter, which declined from the prior quarter, but remained above our target ratio of 10 to 11%. In the quarter, we returned $3.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, including common stock purchases of $3.3 billion and $337 million in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation.  Looking forward, we expect our CET1 ratio to migrate to our target range over the next few quarters as we continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we hold and generate, while supporting balance sheet growth. So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first three quarters of this year might mean for the future.  As a reminder, we started the year with a wide range of scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021, as we did not know how the medical and economic environment would evolve during the year, and the impact it would have most importantly, on our credit reserves. Now, three quarters into the year, macro outlook has steadily improved and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong.  We've already released $2.3 billion of reserves, accounting for over $2 of EPS year-to-date. That still leaves us, however, with a lot of reserves to the remaining uncertainties I spoke about earlier. So our updated scenario one on slide 22 assumes that this uncertainty persists if the medical environment and economic outlook does not improve further and that we therefore don't release any additional credit reserves this year.  That can lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $8.90 per share. Our updated scenario 2, in contrast, assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance as the remaining stimulus and forbearance programs roll off. And then we also see continued improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty, and in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $9.50. In closing, we feel really good about the progress we've made this year as a result of our Investments in marketing, value propositions, technology, and our people.  And as the year has gone on, we've gotten even more confident in our ability to deploy significant resources towards building sustainable long-term growth momentum. Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high-end of the range of EPS expectations, as we originally had for 2020, in 2022. And to continue to drive towards higher levels of sustainable growth over the long term. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou : Thank you, Jeff. Before we open the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the Operator will now open up the line for questions. Brad.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\nRyan Nash : Hey, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Campbell: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash : So as we look ahead to next year, Jeff, you said that you expect to be on the high end of your original 2020, which is what you had mentioned last quarter. If we look back to that time frame, you were expecting mid-to-high loss -- mid-to-high 2s losses provisions. We're going to be in the $3.5 to $4 billion range versus where I look now, losses are running sub-1 and you know that you don't expect them to move up that much for the next few quarters.  So you maybe just one, Jeff, talk about some of the puts and takes that -- such that you wouldn't be above the high-end given how much leverage you have from credit. And then second, Steve, maybe you could expand on the comment that Jeff made to continue to invest to maximize the long-term growth that can help you sustain the financial algorithm that you laid out at the beginning of the call. Thanks.\nJeffrey Campbell: Let me start Ryan by pointing out remarks. We've already -- this year because of the environment added over $2 of EPS to our earnings just from releasing credit reserves. As you think about my comments about 2022, we assume next year we'll have strong credit results, which you can recall from having a several billion dollar good guy on the provision side this year to having more of a normalized for the new world of lower credit losses provision expense next year.  So we see that as a pretty impressive grow over to in fact be confident in getting to the high-end of where we originally thought we'd be in 2020 next year. Considering the magnitude of that grow over, considering that it's not reliant on a full recovery across all of our businesses, we actually see tailwinds that probably will help us in '22 and into 2023. And that's why as I turn it over to Steve, I think we are still emboldened by the progress we've seen bringing new people into the franchise, Ryan that we think we have an opportunity here to continue to invest significant resources to drive longer-term even higher levels of sustainable growth.\nStephen Squeri: Look, I -- if you would have asked me at the beginning of the year, would we invest almost $5 billion in marketing this year? I would've said no, but we're not governed by what level we think we should or what anybody thinks we should hit. We're governed by the fact that there were tremendous opportunities out there.  And when you look at what is going on with our acquisition activities right now, look we brought in 2.6 million cardholders and what we really focus on is what revenue those card holders really bring in. And what we're seeing is we're seeing a cardholder base that is spending more that we're bringing in, that has a better FICO profile, and it's skewing Millennial and it's skewing fee paying.  And so as we run our models will be governed by -- can we continue to acquire these card members and we are. And the reality is, is that -- I've said this from Day 1, we're running this for the long -- the medium to long term. And the reality is, if we continue to find those great opportunities in the consumer base, in the SME base, in some opportunities beyond the card that we might have, we'll continue to invest.  So as we look at it right now, our plan is to continue to be aggressive with our investments, constrained by our investment return models, not constrained by a certain level that people think we should or should not be at. And that's just the way we've been running the business for the last few years, and we'll continue to do that.  And I think it's really served us well during the pandemic. I don't think you would've thought that this year we would've spent that kind of money. And -- but I think the key point is we're spending that money to grow the business profitably. We're not spending that money because we're in some battle to keep up with the Joneses here, okay?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning.\nJeffrey Campbell: Hi Betsy.\nStephen Squeri: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Couple of questions here. First, just following up on that -- on the marketing side, it seems like that is in line with what you've been spending historically as a percentage of revenues. So should we take your comments to mean that you had ramped that up from here or that there's a trajectory of marketing expense that's going to be similar to what you've had in the past as a percentage of revs?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I think Betsy, what you should take is that we're not governed by thinking about, okay, we got to keep the percent of revenue, the marketing represents constant or similar to where it was in 2019. We're governed by the universe of really attractive opportunities we see to build longer-term growth momentum. So that's what has driven our marketing spend now including value injection to over $5 billion this year, much higher than Steve and I started the year thinking it would be.  And as we think about 2022, we're very confident in the kind of EPS outcome that we've been talking about. But the ultimate amount of marketing that goes with that is going to be a function of the attractive opportunities. And because we're getting such great growth from the spending as Steve talked about, we're actually generating more revenue from the dollars that we're investing in marketing than we were pre -pandemic.  The marketing starts to become a little self-funding while still hitting our EPS targets if the opportunities are there. So that's what's going to drive us in terms of how much marketing we do next year. And was there a second -- part 2, Betsy, if the Operator keeps you on.\nOperator: My apologies. Our next question comes from the line Mihir Bathia with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bathia: Hi, and good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Not surprisingly, I also have a question on marketing and engagement spending. So in terms of -- Maybe just talking about it at a little bit of a higher level, right? In terms of competition, I understand that American Express is always been in a very competitive market for many years.  Maybe talk about the dimensions of the competition. Have they changed post-competition? Are you seeing different players? And also, just in terms of your marketing and customer acquisition spending, how is it different today than it was maybe pre -pandemic like in 2019? Is there -- are you making investments in different things? Are customers are asking for different things?\nStephen Squeri: Look, it's -- the only time I'd say competition ramp ed down was during the pandemic when nobody was really acquiring a lot of cards. But when we look at the range of competitors, you have to realize that we're looking at competitors on a global basis, country by country, we're looking at competitors across corporate card, small business, and consumer cards and I think as we talk to, quite honestly as we talk to you guys about competition where the drive tends to be is consumer competition in the U.S. and the reality is that this has been a competitive market since the financial crisis.  I think the consumer card competition really heated up after the financial crisis when the big money center banks decided to really get serious about their consumer card business, and a lot have done a really good job. And we compete very vigorously with them. And so I don't really think it in my mind, I don't think it's changed all that much. I think it paused a little bit during the pandemic, but I don't think it has changed at all.  The other thing that I would say is there are a range of other competitors out there. Fintechs and what have you and we continue to watch them, whether its competitors in the corporate card space, competitors in other places in other places. For buy now, pay later perspective, that's not really a big competitive threat to us. I mean, when you think about buy now, pay later, it tends to be targeted at low FICO, it tends to be targeted at a lot of debit card users, it's used as a customer acquisition vehicle.  And that's just not the game that we're playing. We've had a buy now, pay later product since 2017, and it's just another way for our card members to manage their spending within the overall American Express relationship. It's a transaction by transaction management tool, which quite honestly is a lot more flexible than point-of-sale buy now, pay later because you don't know who is going actually have point-of-sale at every merchant you go to.  And then for the Pay in 4 people, which is also another thing that's out there which is a version of buy now, pay later, there are -- actually our charge card product gives you more float and gives you rewards. I -- but you have to look at all this stuff, whether it's whoever is coming into the space. We look at competitors all the time and you have to evaluate how it attacks your customer base.  But I think the way we run this business and you've seen this over decades is we continually put more value and build a bigger moat around our customers and just look at what we've done with the Platinum Card here, we refreshed this product while it was going gangbusters, both of them. We were at record levels of platinum acquisition before the refresh and yet we went out and refreshed and went out and raised the fee. And how can you do that? Because you're adding more value both on the consumer side and both on the small business side. And so look, in the third quarter, we have record levels of not only Gold and -- not only Platinum but Gold card acquisition for our base.  So we feel really good about that. I think as far as how you spend your money -- look, we do -- obviously, the industry has changed. You do a lot less direct. You do a lot less direct mail than you used to do. You do a -- there's a lot more sort of aggregator on acquisition. But I think what's really important about us and as we look at our marketing spend, we look at our marketing spend not only for prospect marketing, but we invest in our customers.  And we spend marketing money on our customers to continue to grow their spend, to upgrade their product, to introduce them to our lending capabilities. It creates a flywheel, right? Because what you do is you bring these prospects in, and then you manage these prospects and get them to go more and more profitable.  And one of the things that we hang our hat on is we look at our customers as a platform for growth. And if you can continue to do more and more with your customers, they will generate more revenue, you'll have more loyalty and you're seeing that. You're seeing that in our retention metrics. And so, we really look at our marketing spend. It's not just acquisition; it's also with our existing customer base. And that's probably changed a little bit more over the years as we've invested more and more on our customers as are the products that we have continues to expand.\nJeffrey Campbell: And Steve, one of the best examples of that last evolution you talked about is the fact that our member get member program, where our existing card members who are so attached to the brand that they get other card members and friends to also get attached to the brand, that has come from almost nowhere a few years ago to being one of our most significant acquisition channels. And I think it's a real commentary on everything you just talked about.\nOperator: And we do have those follow-up questions from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Squeri: Sorry about that, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck : No problem. Thanks. Yeah. You mentioned during the prepared remarks that this was one of the best quarters for acquiring small business and I wanted to tie that into an article. Was that recently saying that you're going to be working with Goldman Sachs to enable B2B for your clients. This is really in the corporate card, the 200 -- the top 250 companies globally that you work with. And in this article it suggested that you would not be offering transaction account directly from yourself, but you're tying in with a partner to enable that.  Maybe you could give us some color as to how this offering is expected to drive business opportunities, talk about the transaction account banking piece of that and then if you could tie into what you're seeing in SMB and what you could be offering to SMB clients too that would be helpful. Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. It's good to clarify this. So look, we're very excited about the partnership with Goldman and look, we have relationships with 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. And when we compete, as we compete, sometimes we compete with other money center banks that have corporate card programs and also have transaction banking and they tend to integrate that.  And so Goldman is very interested in getting into transaction banking, not as necessarily as interested in getting into the corporate card. We do a number of things with Goldman Sachs from a customer perspective, there are customer of ours, we're customer this. And as John and David and I were talking about things, it looked like a really good opportunity. They were trying to ramp up their transaction banking.  We have the corporate card and putting those things together in that space, a space that we really weren't going to get into transaction banking as it related to large banks. It's not our space. Corporate card is, but not transaction banking. So we decided to look at the top 250 and if that goes well and there's no reason why it will not go well, then we can put it -- put a little bit more downstream to say the S&P 500.  We have a different perspective as it relates to the SME space, which is why, if you remember what we've talked about from an SMB perspective is we wanted to be the working capital providers for our small businesses. And now in the small business space, we have a very good footprint. and not only in the U.S., but good footprints in internationally. We also remember during the pandemic, we bought Kabbage.  And what is Kabbage? Kabbage is basically a transaction banking platform, right? And so what Kabbage has? Kabbage does short-term loans. It does working capital loans, it will do merchant financing loans, it has a transaction banking account, It has debit card attached to it and we have our American Express Card attached to it.  We have a very different philosophy as it relates to small businesses, where the commitment of capital, the commitment of cash that we have to put out, and the commitment from a loan perspective will be much smaller and be much more diffused across the entire SME base. And so we believe it's a sweet spot for us and that was the Kabbage piece of it. We did not believe that transaction banking was a sweet spot for us from an S&P 500 and above. And we're really thrilled to be partnering with Goldman on this.\nBetsy Graseck : Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRobert Napoli: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I wanted to follow up on Steve and Jeff on the SMB business and the competitive environment in that space, and your movements and adding additional products and services. There is a lot more competition, I guess from venture -backed companies like Brex and Divvy and Ramp, or you have Dibby now part of our partner Bill.com.  But how do you see those companies are growing very fast and you're providing, I think spend management or that business spend management services. How do you view that competition relative to your SMB efforts and are there additional products and services and ecosystem you're building for your SMB clients.\nStephen Squeri: Well, look, I mean, from an SME perspective, had pretty good quarter up 13%. So we feel pretty good about that. And I think I'll just point you back to what I just respond to Betsy with. Obviously, we went out and bought Kabbage. And Kabbage has cash flow analysis on it, it has transaction banking, it has debit, it has the ability to loans. And so, now what you do is you take a Fintech platform like Kabbage, you take American Express with over 3 million small business customers, and a sizeable Balance Sheet, and a sizable brand, and a lot of capabilities.  You put that together and we believe it gives us a really great offering as it relates to our SMB base. And look, and I'm not going to discount any of those Ramp or Rex or Debbie or any -- we never discount anybody. And you look to learn from people as well, but we believe that the combination of what we have and the space that we're in, and putting together Kabbage and in also integrating into Kabbage, AECOM pay and our AP capabilities -- our automation capability -- AP automation capabilities puts us in a very, very good position to continue to compete in this space and continue to grow and continue to win.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Eran [Indiscernible] with Citi. Please go ahead.\nEran: Thanks. Maybe we could touch on capital distribution a little bit. The buybacks for the quarter were well above -- I think more than double what the street was expecting. Is that level just more of a catch-up or do you expect to have an elevated level of capital return for the next couple of quarters.\nJeffrey Campbell: Well you are correct, [Indiscernible] quite elevated, probably our largest ever quarter of share. The purchase and into really strictly a catch up. [Indiscernible] This is our first quarter where we were completely free of any Fed constraints on our buyback. We've been very clear for many years that our target CET1 capital ratio was 10% to 11%. As you all know, that is actually well above the regulatory minimums. It's really more governed by our own view of the balance sheet and the rating agency view of the balance sheet. So since the constraints from the FRED were lifted, while we don't want to disrupt the market, we did buy more aggressively. I think you will continue to see us by above what I would call a steady-state level for -- Our steady-state level is pretty high. As a Company with a 30% ROE, we generate a lot more capital than we need each year. But it'll stay elevated until you get back down into that 10% to 11% range, which I'd expect to happen over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Richard Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks guys for taking my questions this morning. Look, I think when we look back at what's happened over the last year, we really see the strength of the American Express franchise from the core business. And in a lot of ways, things have stayed the same. I'm curious when you look forward, what do you think is different about the business as we emerge from the COVID crisis? Is that the demographic of your customer, is it the expansion with Kabbage, what's going to be different in the next three years because of what we've seen in the last year?\nStephen Squeri: Well, I think that if you look at what happened here, I think we've bedded down customers a lot more than we've ever bedded them down in the past. And that was because we really focused on a lot of this value proposition enhancement. And one of the reasons that I started my remarks today with pre -pandemic, at the pandemic, and during the pandemic was to show that this was a bit of a continuum.  When you think about this, what we talked about a number of years ago was really focusing in on our customers, focusing in on refreshing our products and services, becoming more digitally engaged, and expanding that organic core of products and services. And what I think what we saw during the pandemic here was that we saw an accelerant as it related to online. Our online spending has accelerated tremendously, I think were 27% up in Q3 here, goods and services, 19% growth over 19.  And so we've been able to direct our card members in ways faster than we probably would have gotten there without the pandemic. And again, I think looking at our overall strategy of refreshing these card products has led us to expanding our overall base. As we expand the value propositions, look, we're talking about over 70% Millennial and Gen-Z acquisition in a Platinum Card where we just raised the fee to $695.  So it's obviously speaking to that base. And I think that's one of the things we've seen over this time period. It's how much more we are speaking to that customer segment. And so when you put that all together and you add the SME piece of it, which is a complete expansion with Kabbage is that we're opening up a lot more doors for us to do business with our SME customers. And one of the things we've learned is that the more products that you have with your customer, the higher retention rates that you have, obviously, the more revenue that you have, and the more engagement that you have. And so, I think we've probably driven faster to where we thought we were going to get ultimately, as a result of the pandemic, but we haven't fundamentally changed where we were going.  And that's why I wanted to start this conversation this morning with this as a continuum for us. But again, like we've talked about in the environment, online has been accelerated probably 3 years from a macroeconomic perspective, and I think we're seeing our strategy that we were looking to continually to implement that has been accelerated, and it's proven to be right.\nJeffrey Campbell: For one financial, [Indiscernible] Rick and Steve, I'd add to that is very similar, is that our funding structure has actually changed quite significantly over the course of the pandemic to be more heavily weighted to our depository products, which are our lowest cost of funding. And when I project the head for years, that trend is going to continue. So that is actually, I think perhaps a little notice, but very positive change for us as well when you look a little longer-term.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. One of the point that I'll just make and not to beat on this, but when you look at the fact that we -- when you look at our acquisition and you see where we are acquiring these card members, it has actually expanded our playing field. And so with that playing field expanded, that's why you're seeing this broader marketing spend because you have more customers to go after. You have more archetypes now that you can go after than you did probably 3 or 4 years ago because the product is speaking to a broader set of consumers out there now.  Broader in terms of the demographic and broader in terms of age and so forth, and wants and needs that the products are getting -- all getting broader. And a product can now appeal to multiple customer sets. And you're seeing differentiation between the products. It's just not an upgrade. When you look at the Gold versus the Platinum, there is specific differences here that speak to another different consumer or different small business customer. So I think that has probably changed as well.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I was just curious on the 3 million SME customers. As you look at the total U.S. SME spend, does that volume growth typically track the total market given how penetrated you are there with your relationships? And I guess, would that include any cash conversion or I know it represents inventories, is most of that done on card any way? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Look, I don't have sort of market share information on that, but -- sort of at the tip of my fingers here. But it is -- we think from a 13% growth perspective, we are probably growing at or above market at this particular point in time. But when we look at this, what is down from an SME perspective is T&E. You are seeing a conversion of check or cash or wire to card and I think we saw that during the pandemic and I think that's where some of the investment in our AP automation has helped as well.  And when you talk about B2B spending approximately 80% of SME spending is B2B spending. Maybe 85% of SME spending is B2B spending and they use it for lots of different things. They -- there are some inventory management. But remember, our SME base is so broad and it's professional services, lawyers, HVAC, so forth and so on.  And so they do use the product or goods for resale as well. It's -- auto glass companies use it to buy auto glass and plumbers use it buy supplies and so forth so on. And you're probably seeing a little bit more cash conversion, but we're pretty pleased with that 13% number of growth plus with the T&E component of that being down.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have another follow-up question on the growth that you're seeing in the Millennial and GenZ that you called out on Slide 5. Can you just take a step back and comment a bit on what features and reward specifically or like which card profiles that you're seeing are particularly attracting -- attract those consumers like have you, how have you been that -- this successful over the last couple of years and then also, can you give us any sense of the percentage of your U.S. card-based or some measure along those lines that's currently in those younger cohort?\nStephen Squeri: Last part, we don't really, we haven't -- I don't know if we've disclosed the last point, but let me go with the first point while they feverously look for that answer, Lisa, as sitting around the table with me. As far as the first part, look, Millennials and Gen-Zs are about experiences. And they are about access. And I can speak for experience having a house full of them. And so, they love to travel; they love to do things.  And when you look at the Platinum Card product, which had always been positioned as, hey, I'm a real high spender, I need to have that Platinum Card product, you have to look at the utility of this product. And you look at fine Hotels and Resorts and you look at the value that you get out of a fine hotel and resort booking with an early check-in and a late checkout, or a free breakfast and a $100 credit at the hotel.  And then you look at streaming credits, their online shoppers, this rewards accelerators, this travel credits, this access to tickets, this access to special part member events, it is a range of services that they use. And look, Equinox is another benefit that we put on and, look, we just added Walmart, Walmart Plus membership, which a majority of our Platinum Card holders shop at Walmart. We think this is a great benefit as well.  So when they look at this product, it really is a lifestyle product for them. One that ranges from their everyday activities of online spending and streaming all the way to traveling. And the credits they get, whether it's Global Entry and TSA Pre and all those kinds of things. So it is a wide ranging value-rich product for these younger people and older people like myself. But basically out of this particular cohort, it's 27% of our overall spending and in the third quarter that grew 38%. We feel pretty good about that as we move in. So that's the -- I think that gives you the answer to your second question.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Min Zhao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMin Zhao: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about potential M&A. Are there any areas in your product set that might benefit from possible bolt-on acquisitions? And then has there been more opportunities to engage in the syntax space or if high evaluations continue to be a headwind to any activity there? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Well, I mean, look, let's take a low historical walk down memory lane. But we have -- we bought Resy which was a great bolt-on acquisition for us with dining and it becomes a great system for new card members because we don't just limit Resy to our cardholders. And then we added Lounge Body, which is the lounge finder, which provides our card members not only with access to our Centurion lounges, but other relationships that we have, over 1200 lounges, and it'll also give them perspective on if our lounges are full enough. Then we bought Resy and we bought Cake and a few others and then obviously, Kabbage. So look, we're constantly looking an AECOM pay we bought as well. So we're constantly looking for those bolt-on acquisitions, things that will continue to drive our overall organic core and make our overall products that better. Some of the things are -- Obviously, the prices for Fintech are obviously some of these things are very highly valued, and obviously the math doesn't work, but the way we've looked at it is if something makes strategic sense overall, then we'll look at doing it. But I think the big thing for us is we have a feeder system with Amex Ventures, where we have probably investments in 40 plus 50 different entities right now. And it gives us an opportunity to test drive them. It gives us an opportunity to learn and through some of these investments, it led to us acquiring companies down the road. So look, you never say never about anything and that's probably as far as I'm going to go, but we're always interested in things that are going to be accretive to the Company overall.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark De Vries : Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you about how you're thinking about crypto. As you attract more of these millennials and Gen Zs or digitally native, how important is it to think about offering either the ability to pay or integrating it into your rewards prop? And then also on a related matter, how are you thinking about whether there is a role to play developing kind of a supplemental settlement layer to address interoperability issues. And then finally, when should we expect you to buy CryptoPunk?\nStephen Squeri: So look, we think about a broad range of digital currencies from crypto to stable coins to government-backed digital currencies. And look, there's -- we think about cryptocurrency much more as an asset class at this particular point in time. We don't use our card to sort of buy stock. People don't use our card to buy stock and I don't think people are going to use our card anytime soon to buy to buy crypto. So I don't I see that as a big role. Having said that within closed ecosystems of NFTs and stable coins and things like that, you see it. We're on MBA Topshop. You can use the card there and there's a few other places where you can use the card and we'll see how that all plays out. I think there are opportunities down the road, potentially membership rewards and things like that as redemption options. But I don't see at this point and I don't foresee it at any point where crypto currency is going to be a threat to traditional credit card payments and there's a lot of reasons for that. There's -- Obviously, there's rewards. There's service. There is the ability to dispute, and there's also the ability to extend credit. So there's always a role. I think as I get asked this question, is it going to displace traditional credit cards? And I think the answer to that is no. I think there is a role though for digital currencies. I think it can make cross-border payments a lot more seamless and a lot easier to conduct. And so, we'll see how government digital currencies and other stable coins play out.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW, please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Thanks. When we look at the year-over-year improvement in goods and services, I guess, is there a way to parse apart how much of that is your same customer growth versus new customer growth versus inflation? I'm just trying to think about how that cycle through when travel and entertainment comes back. I have one follow-up after that. Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Well, we don't think it's a hell of a lot of inflation at this particular point in time. As far as new customer, there were a lot of new customers we acquired last year. And so same customer sales are driving quite a bit but we don't -- I don't have that at my fingertips at this point. But I think what I would say is that when we see -- what we've seen from a value proposition injection perspective last year, we saw a lot of that stuff stick. So we saw more card members putting wireless on. We saw more card members putting streaming services on. And that has continued to flow through. We've seen more of our card members putting online spending on. So I think that -- our belief is that's going to stick and when you look at goods and services growth, it's 19% over 2019, it's 18% over 2020. So it has been that. It has been consistent. So that -- I think that's here to stay, and I think what will happen is we'll get that travel.  The other thing I would say is, we talked about the millennial cohort before and that being up 38%. Our boomers are not back. And so the majority of our traditional card base is not back yet and that is not growing at 38%. But in reality is, they will come back. And they will come back as they feel more safe. And so we think that's a tailwind for us going forward.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Right. That's very helpful. And then I guess, Jeff, is there a way to be more specific on the provision next year? I know it's going to be dependent on loan growth and the macro. But as you're thinking about what's embedded in your expectations for the high-end of the range. I mean, is it close to several billions of dollars and maybe you could just talk through that please?\nJeffrey Campbell: Well, I think Sanjay, the way to think about it is many financial institutions were still holding an appropriately but significant level of reserves driven by the uncertainty in the medical and economic environment. At some point that level of uncertainty is going to decrease down to 0. And at some point, those reserves being held for that have to also go pushing much down to 0. Now -- so that's got to happen probably mostly over the course of next year.  On the other hand, as loan growth begins to pick back up, which it has in the last quarter, as delinquency start to drift up, I don't think they're going to spike up, but they'll drift up a little bit then the actual or what I'm going to call BAU fewer provision is going to start to drift out. What's really hard to predict those on days the relative pace of those two things next year.  What I feel very confident, though, in pointing out as I did a few minutes ago is that relative to this year where you've had billions of dollars that have led you to a net benefit on the provision line, I certainly don't expect that next year, which is why we feel pretty good about the confidence and the range we've given, given that it actually represents several -- just billions of dollars of improved business performance from a pre -provision perspective. But those are the dynamics that we think about.\nSanjay Sakhrani : Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandetti: Good morning. So I'll close it out with a question on regulation, Jeff. A lot of things have been going well for the Company. I just want to check in, specifically on the U.S. side and just see if you're feeling comfortable as you can with the environment.\nStephen Squeri: Hi. Don, I'll answer it. I think, whereas comfortable as we could be at this particular point in time for everything that we know, but you're always worried about everything. Regulation is one of those things but I think right now, I think we're okay. And we think about regulation, we specifically think about things that have happened in Europe and things that happened in Australia and so forth that we really don't see that happening in the U.S.  We'll see what happens as it relates to the CFPB s and how that all plays out. But I think we've lived in this environment along time. We know how to operate in this environment, and I think we'll just be fine. But I don't see any sort of curve balls, if you will, coming down the pike at this point. So that's what I have to say about it.\nVivian Zhou : With that, we will bring the call to an end.

With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80. These results reflect an acceleration of the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our core business and a strengthening macro environment. Our improving performance is a clear indication that the steps we\u2019ve taken to manage the Company through the pandemic and our investments to rebuild growth momentum are paying off. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the progress we\u2019re seeing in several key areas, including engaging and retaining our existing customers, acquiring new customers, continued excellent credit performance and an acceleration in spending. Since the onset of the pandemic, we\u2019ve been investing in short-term value enhancements to several of our premium products, which has helped drive Card Member engagement and contributed to retention levels that remain higher than the last few years. We\u2019ve also ramped up our acquisition engine over the past several quarters. And we\u2019re really pleased to see that overall acquisitions of proprietary cards, which include our co-brands, have continued to increase with 2.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. In fact, demand for our premium fee-based products accelerated this quarter with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer and Small Business Platinum and Gold cards well above 2019 levels and exceeding prior quarters, contributing to the continued double-digit growth in net card fees. Early spending on these new accounts is strong. We\u2019re also pleased to see that acquisitions are increasing in many of our co-brand portfolios. For example, as Ed Bastian mentioned on Delta\u2019s earnings call last week, Delta co-brand acquisitions reached 90% of 2019 levels in Q2. Turning to credit. We continue to see excellent credit performance with both delinquency and write-off rates improving further and reaching near historic lows in the quarter. We\u2019re also seeing continued improvements in Card Member spending. Spending recovery accelerated in Q2 with overall billed business volumes growing 51% in the quarter on an FX-adjusted basis versus last year and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in June. Goods and services volumes continued to strengthen, increasing 16% globally on an FX-adjusted basis versus Q2 2019. Travel and entertainment spending also accelerated in the quarter, particularly in the U.S., where a growing percentage of the population is now fully vaccinated. In fact, we saw a surge in spending by U.S. Consumer Card Members across all T&E categories, with overall U.S. Consumer T&E spending reaching 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and continuing to grow into July. T&E spending outside the U.S. continues to recover more slowly due to the overall -- due to lower overall vaccination rates and government-imposed restrictions in some geographies. In our consumer business, the largest contributor to spending growth in goods and services came from millennial and Gen Z customers and they are also leading the recovery in T&E spending, with total spending up over 30% on an FX adjusted basis versus 2019 levels in Q2 for this age cohort. In our commercial business, overall small and midsized enterprise volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q2, driven by continued strong growth globally in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019. While the T&E recovery also accelerated, with the fastest total growth coming from smaller sized businesses in the U.S. We\u2019re also seeing solid spending growth in key travel-related co-brand portfolios. Volumes on both Delta and Hilton co-brand cards increased by double digits versus pre-pandemic levels in the quarter, driven by the same trends of continued strong growth in goods and services spending and an acceleration in the recovery of T&E spend. In addition to investing in retention and acquisition activities as a customer-focused company led by innovation, a key part of our investment strategy is geared toward delivering a continuous stream of differentiated products, services and capabilities that provide additional value to our current customers and attract new ones to the franchise. We invest in innovation in a number of ways through internal development, acquisitions, co-brand relationships and partnerships with both digital startups and large well-known brands across a range of industries. A great example of our approach to innovation is our strategy for regularly refreshing our unique value propositions by leveraging our digital ecosystem and our diverse network of partners. On July 1st, we marked the restart of this strategy with the launch of our new enhanced Platinum Card for consumers in the U.S. The American Express Platinum Card created the premium card category nearly 40 years ago and has continued to define the category ever since. We intend to make sure it remains a competitive standard for many years to come. The reason for Platinum\u2019s success over the years, I believe, is twofold: First is our continual focus on knowing our customers and delivering value that meets their evolving needs and preferences. And second is our willingness to change our value propositions even as our products are at the peak of their performance. And that\u2019s the case with our most recent refresh. Despite just coming off our best quarter ever for U.S. Platinum account acquisitions, we introduced our new U.S. Consumer Platinum Card, featuring a broader set of lifestyle benefits while doubling down on travel-related benefits. The new benefits are enabled by working with an expanded range of partners as well as the continued integration of our growing portfolio of digital assets such as Resy and LoungeBuddy. I would note that the last time we refreshed our U.S. Platinum Card, we doubled the customer base, bringing in a larger number of younger card members, and our intent with our current refresh is to attract an even broader pool of customers to the franchise. In developing the new Platinum Card, we listened to our card members and gleaned insights from their spending behavior to determine what features and benefits would be most relevant for the way they live now. For example, some of the spending patterns on certain everyday goods and services categories that emerged during the pandemic, such as streaming services and personal fitness, have continued into the recovery. This led us to add a series of annual credits for digital entertainment services and Equinox club memberships or digital subscriptions to their on-demand app. Our Platinum Card Members have always cared a lot about travel and entertainment. And as our recent quarterly results demonstrate, our U.S.-based customers are eagerly returning to travel and in-person dining. So, we added a series of new travel-related benefits to the refresh product on top of those Platinum Card already offers, including a significant expansion of our proprietary Centurion Lounge network and a new global dining access program powered by Resy, our online reservation platform, that provides exclusive access to some of the world\u2019s best restaurants and premium dining experiences. The enhancements we\u2019ve made to the U.S. Platinum Card represent a significant increase in value, which we believe will be very attractive to both current and new customers, even with an increase in its annual fee. As we have seen from previous refreshes, customers are willing to pay more for what they see as Platinum\u2019s unique value, and we believe it will be no different in this case. In fact, the very early indications are encouraging. Applications and acquisitions have outpaced our expectations in the first two weeks since the new Platinum Card became available. The U.S. Platinum Refresh is just one example of how we\u2019re leveraging partnerships in our digital ecosystem to innovate and add differentiated value to our products and services. We\u2019ll be refreshing other products and rolling out new digital capabilities for both, consumer and commercial customers throughout the remainder of the year and beyond. We\u2019re really excited about the new U.S. Platinum Card and the potential that it and other innovations we have in the pipeline represent. And there are many other reasons why I feel very good about where we are at the halfway point in the year, including the progress we\u2019re making to rebuild momentum in our core business is accelerating and better than we expected at the beginning of the year, the improvements we\u2019re seeing across many of our key metrics are sign that our strategy for managing through the pandemic and investing in activities to rebuild our growth momentum is working. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the strength we\u2019re seeing in customer retention, new account acquisitions, credit performance and overall spending volumes, with goods and services volumes now well above pre-pandemic levels globally and travel and entertainment spending recovering faster than we expected, driven by significant improvement in the United States. Taking all of these factors together, we are increasingly optimistic that the strength we\u2019ve seen in our core business through the first half will continue, particularly in the U.S., even as the pace of recovery remains uneven in different regions around the world. With this in mind, we remain committed to executing our investment strategy for growing our business over the long term. And based on current trends, we are confident in our ability to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff, who will discuss our second quarter results in detail, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be here today to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion were up 31% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, as we lapped the trough of the billings and revenue declines that occurred during the most significant pandemic lockdowns in Q2 of last year. Our second quarter net income was $2.3 billion and earnings per share was $2.80. These strong results were, of course, in part driven by an $866 million credit reserve release as we saw continued strong credit performance and some improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. Now, as I turn to a more detailed look at our results, I\u2019ll again focus on what we see as the key drivers of our great progress towards our 2022 financial objectives: volumes, credit trends and the marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum. As we\u2019ve said all year, 2021 itself is a transition year, positioning us for 2022 and beyond. So, let\u2019s now get into the first key driver to watch as we measure our progress this year, volumes, which you will see several views of on slides 3 through 9. You will note that we have shown second quarter volume trends on both, a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019, as we find this provides a clearer picture of how spending is recovering on the way to our 2022 financial objectives. And that clear picture on slide 3 shows an acceleration in the pace of recovery across all of our volumes in the second quarter with total network volumes and billed business volumes up around 50% year-over-year, as we lapped the trough of the billings declines from Q2 2020. Importantly, relative to 2019, total network volumes, billed business and processed volumes were all down just 2% on an FX-adjusted basis and surpassed pre-COVID levels for the month of June. The acceleration in billed business is being driven by both spending on goods and services, which was up 16% versus 2019, as you can see on slide 4, and by a notable improvement in spending on travel and entertainment in the second quarter. Overall T&E spending reached nearly 70% of 2019 levels as we exited Q2. This is a level we originally expected we would not reach until the fourth quarter this year. So, to see it recovering more quickly than we had expected and without it coming at the cost of any slowing in the growth in goods and services spending is a positive indicator for us. Turning to slide 5. You do see that the billed business volume recovery is being led by the U.S., which surpassed 2019 levels and was up 3% in the quarter. The recovery in total billed business volumes outside of the U.S. is weaker. Interestingly, though, you see on the top right of slide 5 that the growth in goods and services spending has been strong in both, the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Overall spend is weaker outside the U.S. because historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions, and international T&E is recovering more slowly due to lower vaccination rates and continued government restrictions in certain geographies. Focusing in then on just our consumer business on slide 6, you see that overall spending was 4% above 2019 levels in the quarter, as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 18% versus 2019. And we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we\u2019ve seen during the pandemic, even as offline spending recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In our commercial business, as you can see on slide 7, global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our commercial billed business, remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spend up 6% versus 2019 for the quarter. This performance was supported by continued growth in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% versus 2019. In contrast, on slide 8, large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We have said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. Finally, putting all customer types T&E spending together on slide 9, you do see improvement across the board in the second quarter, with total T&E spending reaching nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the month of June. As I said earlier, this recovery has been faster than we expected, led by a sharp recovery in U.S. consumer T&E spending, which reached 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and has continued to grow in July. Looking ahead, we now assume that overall T&E spending globally will have recovered to around 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021. We also expect continued steady growth in goods and services spending for the remaining 2021. So, all in all, a really good story on spending volumes. Moving to our other volume metric, receivable and loan balances on slide 10. You\u2019ll see a slightly different set of charts here and in a few other places throughout this presentation, where we thought it would be helpful to show comparisons for the first and second quarter relative to both 2020 and 2019 to help with better rate of recovery. Loan balances began to slowly recover in the second quarter and were up 7% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Relative to 2019 though, loan balances remained down 11%, 11% more than spending volumes. We continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I\u2019ll talk about in a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes. This leads then to the second key driver to watch this year, credit and provision, on slides 11 through 14. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I\u2019d like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance with Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows, although we would expect loss rates to slowly return to more normal levels eventually. Given how low delinquency rates are today, we don\u2019t expect to see a material increase in write-off rates anytime this year. This strong credit performance, combined with some improvement in our macroeconomic outlook, drove a $606 million provision expense benefit in the second quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve release, as shown on slide 12. That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $1.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on slide 13. We are closely monitoring how the Card Members exiting our financial relief programs are performing, and early performance of recent exits has looked quite strong. But we are mindful that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off, and there are remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment around the world, including in the U.S. So, we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. As you see on slide 14, we ended the second quarter with $4 billion of reserves, representing 5% of loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to build long-term growth momentum, on slide 15. We invested $1.3 billion in marketing in the second quarter as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while maintaining some of our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.4 million new cards, up around 20% sequentially. More importantly than just the total number of cards, we\u2019ve seen great demand for our premium fee-based products with new accounts acquired on these products up 30% versus the prior quarter and up almost 4 times year-over-year. As Steve mentioned, as some great examples, acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small business Platinum and Gold cards all reached well above 2019 levels this quarter. Based on the momentum we\u2019ve seen in the first half of this year, we would now expect to see around $5 billion in marketing spend this year. Ultimately though, our marketing levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities we see and the pace at which we finish winding down our value-injection efforts in the remainder of the year. So, what does all this mean for revenues on slide 16? Total revenues were up 33% year-over-year in the second quarter, and we had double-digit growth in almost every one of our revenue lines, except for net interest income, which only accounts for 18% of our revenues. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, led the recovery though, as it was up 56% on an FX-adjusted basis year-over-year, as shown on slide 17. This recovery is primarily driven by the strong growth in goods and services spending that we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter. Importantly, these revenues have been our most resilient revenue line throughout the pandemic, as you can see on slide 18. They are now $300 million or 30% higher than they were back in the second quarter of 2019, demonstrating the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both, prospects and existing customers. The one revenue line showing a slower recovery is net interest income on slide 19, which, as I mentioned, accounts for only 18% of our revenues. For us though, the driver here is the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. Looking ahead, I continue to expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. So, to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q2, as you can see on slide 20. While revenues remain 6% below pre-pandemic levels on an FX adjusted basis, they were up 31% year-over-year. Looking forward, with the momentum in goods and services spend growth we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year and our updated assumption that we now expect overall T&E to recover to 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of the year, full year revenue growth could be around 12% to 14%, assuming current trends continue. Moving on to expenses. We\u2019re continuing to break out on slide 21, our variable customer engagement expenses, which moved with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were up 85% year-over-year, driven by higher spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I\u2019d expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the remainder of the year. Moving on to operating expenses. You can see that they were down 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio. In 2021, full year, given the year-to-date gains we\u2019ve seen in our equity investment portfolio, I\u2019d now expect our full year OpEx to be a bit below the $11.5 billion we originally expected, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses while also investing to build growth momentum in our business. Turning next to capital on slide 22. Our capital position remains tremendously strong. Our Q2 CET1 ratio of 14.2% remains far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year and growth in our capital base from earnings that have exceeded distributions. We returned $1.3 billion in total to shareholders this quarter, including common stock repurchases of $908 million and $346 million in common stock dividends. Looking forward, we remain committed to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. Given the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest guidance, we plan to increase the pace of share repurchases to migrate towards our CET1 ratio target over the next few quarters. So, let\u2019s close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first half of the year might mean for the future. In January and again in April, I laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happens with credit reserves. As a reminder, our scenario one or low scenario assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the subsequent quarters. Now, halfway into the year, the macro outlook has improved somewhat, and our actual credit performance has remained incredibly strong. So, we\u2019ve already released $1.9 billion of reserves. That still leaves us, however, with a reserve ratio that is above pre-pandemic levels due to the remaining uncertainties. So, our updated scenario one on slide 23 assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical environment and economic outlook worsens and that we therefore don\u2019t release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of an 80% overall T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $7.50 per share. Our updated scenario two in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 12% to 14% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $8.75. More important though than these 2021 numbers is our focus on managing the Company to further build growth momentum. Our progress this quarter around our key drivers, volumes, credit performance and marketing was very strong, and this gives us confidence that our strategies are working. Based on all these current trends, we are confident in our ability in 2022 to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had before the pandemic for 2020 of $8.85 to $9.25. And we are confident in our ability to resume our financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Kevin?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, very strong spending growth. I guess, when we look inside the bill business growth, how much of that strength is coming from pent-up demand versus some of the new account growth? I\u2019m just curious, just trying to figure out how long this can last, obviously, knowing that T&E volume is still on the come. And just a quick clarification, Jeff, on the value injections, should we assume that as T&E comes back, those value injections slow? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Maybe I\u2019ll start, Steve, just because your -- last part of your question is quick, Sanjay. And then, you can talk, Steve, about the broader pent-up demand trends. On value injection, Sanjay, certainly, with what we\u2019re seeing in the world now, we would expect that to continue to go down each quarter and be completely gone by the end of the year. And so, that\u2019s one of the reasons. As you think about 2022, our overall marketing line dollars should be down a little bit in 2022 from 2021 because value injection will be at zero. But Steve, you probably want to talk a little bit about the demand issues.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, Sanjay, I think, it\u2019s a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn\u2019t acquire anywhere near the amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we\u2019re still ramping up, and we\u2019re still not at overall levels of acquisition that we want to be at. And the reason for that is you\u2019ve got international, which is not opened up. And so, acquisition levels from an international perspective, both from an SME side of it, from a consumer side of it, is not there. You\u2019ve got corporate card acquisition. Not a lot of companies are adding a lot of people. And so, you don\u2019t have that. So, when you really start to dig into this, a lot of this is really the pent-up demand. And so, just take a look at what we\u2019re looking at. And we look at Hilton co-brand cards and we look at Delta co-brand cards, we continue to see them sequentially month-over-month add more volume. And what you\u2019re now seeing is you\u2019re seeing volume being added in T&E, but you are seeing sustained volume growth in goods and services. And so, we think we\u2019ve done a really good job with the value injection in pivoting sort of people how they thought about these cards. And so, looking back years from now, we may find that one of the sort of the bright spots of this for us from a spending perspective is people found other ways to use their cards, and we actually improved our goods and services mix. So, I think you\u2019re seeing that pent-up demand coming from existing cardholders. And yet, we\u2019re not back to travel levels in any way, shape or form. The other thing, if you start to sort of dig into our spending by sort of age group, we mentioned that our millennial spending is up 30% over 2019. Well, then you can just take that and you go to the boomers and you go to our next level of people, and that spending is still building up. So, we believe there\u2019s still a lot of spending within our existing base. You look at corporate spending, which is about half of what it was. Small Business, while doing very well from a goods and services perspective is still challenged from a T&E perspective. And so, we believe that a lot of the growth that we\u2019ve had has come from the existing base and I think there\u2019s more to come from that existing base. And as we get more and more Card Members on board, you\u2019re going to see more spending there as well. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.\nOperator: Next question is from Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to dig in a little bit on the commentary around the marketing spend and the value injection you just indicated. On the Slide 15, you go through and indicate the degree of value injection quarter-by-quarter. And just wanted to understand how you think about that value injection and how that has impacted the retention as well as the acquisition with the question, as you move into next year, do you think that acquisition and retention rate will be able to remain at levels that you\u2019re seeing this year even without that value injection? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: So, the short answer is yes. But you probably want a little more color than that.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: So, if you think about -- let\u2019s go back to why. So, why did we do the value injection? So, we did the value injection to make sure that the value propositions that were challenged at the time, which were predominantly travel-based value propositions, would no -- people wouldn\u2019t look at it and say, I\u2019m not getting value from the card. And that was -- I think that we\u2019ll look back on that as a very important decision because what it said to our customers is that, look, we know that you are -- you bought the product for a specific reason, you cannot use that product to -- we always talk about experiences and access, and you can\u2019t get that. And so, what we did was -- and I give our teams and our marketing teams a tremendous amount of credit here, is we look for categories that people were going to really double down on in streaming services, wireless services, more shipping services, even dining on some of our co-brand cards, and we invested a lot of money in value injection. The other thing that we did is we also, at the top end on our Platinum and our Centurion, is put credits in for travel, okay, which is one of the reasons our -- I think our TLS bookings are now above 2019 levels in June. And we continue that at the beginning of the year because the beginning of the year, we were still unsure, but we changed the value injection. So on Platinum Card, we went to a PayPal credit. And that PayPal credit was to get more embedding within that ecosystem, so that you have more cards on file. But our plan has been and always has been is that the value that we have in our products stands on its own. And once we got to the point where people could take advantage of the existing product, and this is predominantly more of a U.S. phenomenon at this particular point in time, you didn\u2019t need that value injection. And so, then we get back to, okay, what did we learn? And then you look at the Platinum Refresh. And if you look at the Platinum Refresh, what does that have? Well, it has a wider variety of components to it in terms of streaming. It has digital credits, whether it\u2019s Sirius or Peacock or New York Times or what have you. And it also has another travel credit within there. And so, we don\u2019t believe we need to rely on value injection at all. And so, as you look at the high marketing going forward, we believe the value of the products will stand for themselves. Having said that, we\u2019re also going to go back on our quest to continue to refresh our product portfolio, and you\u2019re seeing that. You obviously just start it with the Platinum Card, and we\u2019re not going to stop at the Platinum Card, but I\u2019ll stop at that comment at this point. And so, when you look at the $5 billion in spending, what we made the decision this year is we weren\u2019t going to cap that spending. So, at the beginning of the year, you\u2019re seeing a lot of value injection, but we also made decision at the beginning of the year to go in with more customer acquisition. And so, we\u2019ll continue to do that, which will drive us closer to the $5 billion. But the bottom line on this is that our products were resilient through this. We propped them up a little bit. We learned a lot. And what we\u2019re seeing with our consumers right now is that they are utilizing these value propositions. And they\u2019re utilizing these value propositions with lounge visits, with bookings, by using the travel credits and all the benefits that come with Gold and Platinum. We talked a lot about Platinum, but the Gold Card too is another premium product that we have. And that has been positioned a lot more as a dining product. And that has taken off as restaurants, especially in the United States, have come back. So the short answer I guess is that we don\u2019t believe we need value injection anymore. We believe the value in the products will continue to sustain the spending. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Togut, Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDavid Togut: What is your expected time line and trajectory of the international T&E billings recovery? And as a related question on international, when will domestic China American Express become material to overall revenue and earnings?\nSteve Squeri: All right. So, the first one, if anybody on the call can tell me, that would be good, because I don\u2019t know. I think, you\u2019ve got a situation in Europe. Look, look at Japan with the Olympics, right? I mean everybody is expecting spectators to be that there\u2019s no spectators there. You\u2019ve got Australia, which is still closed. You\u2019ve got the UK, which is battling the delta variant. And so, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with international. Having said that, our billings continue to improve in international. People, much like they were in the U.S., are looking for ways to travel, whether that be car trips, whether that be more restaurant and so forth. And so, I don\u2019t really expect international to come back this year and hopefully, at some point next year. But that\u2019s really all going to be driven by vaccination and the efficacy of vaccinations. And remember, the vaccines that are available in different -- in other countries are not the same vaccines that are available in the United States. And there\u2019s different efficacy on all different types of vaccines, whether that\u2019s AstraZeneca, which has like a 67% efficacy; or it\u2019s a Moderna or a Pfizer, which is up at 88%. And so, what you\u2019re seeing in the UK now is vaccinating -- vaccinated people actually get COVID, not being hospitalized or dying, but still getting COVID. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see international come back this year. I think -- and it\u2019s not really in our -- we look at it as a tailwind for sort of 2022 and 2023 for us. As far as China goes, look, China is -- we\u2019re really pleased with what\u2019s going on in China. And part of the China story is continuing to build the network and continue to build the card base, and we continue month-over-month to build that network and to build that card base. And as we move into other quarters, we\u2019ll provide more insight into what\u2019s going on. But I\u2019m not -- I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re going to expect China to be a material part of our revenue base or our earnings base in the near-term future, more medium to long term, but I\u2019d also like to remind everybody of the model that we have in China. The model that we have in China is a network-based model. And a way to think about a network-based model is to think about that model much like Visa and MasterCard\u2019s normal model is. We\u2019re not taking card fees. We\u2019re not getting a discount rate. We\u2019re getting network fees, and that\u2019s the way that\u2019s working. But we are building China. We believe it will add more scale, not only for us and more presence in China for both our card members at travel ad, but it will also add scale for us as people -- as Chinese Card Members travel outside of China and add more scale and add more volume to the overall network. So, China will not be material in the near term.\nJeff Campbell: Steve, I would just emphasize one point back on the international spending, which is, it is important to go back to slide 5 of the deck and realize that outside the U.S., spending on goods and services actually has recovered just as strongly as it has in the U.S., and we expect that will continue. The other thing to remember is that as we express our confidence in our ability to get to our 2022 financial objectives, we\u2019re really not counting on international T&E coming back in any meaningful way next year. If we are confident it will at some point and whenever it does, that will be a tailwind, but it\u2019s not a key element of our confidence about 2022. So, next question, operator?\nOperator: And that\u2019s from the line of Ryan Nash, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: So, I maybe just wanted to flesh out the 2022 expectations a little bit further. So, Jeff, you talked about 12% to 14% revenue growth this year. I think that would put you back at 2019 levels. So, can you maybe what -- explain to us what\u2019s incorporated for the high end in terms of spend and top line? Are you assuming that GNS could continue to run elevated, or are you assuming some sort of a handoff to T&E, given all the pent-up demand? And secondly, Jeff, can you maybe just clarify the capital comments, -- how quickly can you get back to 10% to 11%? It seems like there could be a pretty big buyback over the next few quarters? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, maybe we\u2019ll work backwards, Steve, because I think the capital one\u2019s simpler than the first one. The On capital, Ryan, you should -- as I said in my remarks, look, we\u2019re going to increase the pace of our share repurchases. And we will get back within our CET1 target range of 10% to 11% over the next few quarters. In many ways, the governor on that is as we increase the size of our share repurchases, we want to be mindful of overall volumes in the market. And we\u2019re not trying to do anything that is in the near term going to drive the stock price. So, we\u2019ll get there in the next few quarters. Exactly when will be a little bit of a function of what kind of volumes and trading we see in the overall market. But we\u2019re committed to being in that 10% to 11% range, and that means we got a lot of capital return to shareholders.\nSteve Squeri: So, as we think about next year and now, look, we went from comments of our aspiration was to be in the range to comments today of our anticipation is we\u2019ll be at the high end of the range. So, what\u2019s driving that? The first thing I want to -- so to clearly state is, given that the recovery is uneven, we will continue to invest, as we\u2019ve been investing. And I think we have pulled back in our international card investment right now because it just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to continue to double down on that. And so, we will continue as we move into next year to invest in not only our U.S. card acquisition, but international card acquisition, both small business and premium products. What are the assumptions behind sort of next year\u2019s getting to that high end? Well, look, we need consumer T&E to fully recover in 2022. And it\u2019s on a path to do that. So that is I think good. Obviously, like a reasonably healthy economy as well. And so all things being equal, things continue the way they are in the U.S., we feel really confident. What\u2019s not in those financial objectives is the following, a full recovery of net interest income. And you can look at our revenue, and you see where we are from a net interest income perspective. Corporate T&E is not factored in there, which we don\u2019t believe that will come back until 2023. Cross-border T&E we believe will continue to be challenged. And the comments that Jeff just made about international, while goods and services, we think will continue to grow. I think consumer T&E and corporate T&E and international will continue to be challenged. So, if that comes back, obviously, that provides upside and there would be tailwinds for 2022, but we\u2019d more be counting on those as tailwinds for 2023. But again, it\u2019s really hard to predict. But that\u2019s a positive for us. The one thing I will have people keep in mind though is that we have -- we\u2019ve had some big reserve releases. And as Jeff mentioned, when we talk about sort of $7.50 to $8.75, the $8.75 would anticipate some more releases, which would mean even bigger reserve releases. And so, you have to grow over that. And part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary bill that we did last year. But I\u2019d like to point out the other part of those reserve releases is the extraordinary job our credit team is doing. And so, that\u2019s the other piece of it that we take into account, all that being said, we feel really good about how we\u2019re tracking for this year. And that\u2019s why we feel good about saying the high end of the range for 2022. And I just gave you a bunch of upside possibilities, and I just gave you the grow-over possibility as well, with the awesome notion is we\u2019re not going to get the marketing cutting -- we\u2019re not going to cut marketing to get there. We\u2019re not going to be at $5 billion because we will not have value injection there, but we will continue to invest in marketing because I think it has proven for us to be a great source of revenue growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Donat of Piper Sandler.\nChris Donat: I had one question about net card fees, Jeff. When I look pre-pandemic, they\u2019ve been growing -- and this is slide 18, grown around 20%. And then with the pandemic and the lower issues going on there, growth decelerated for the net card fees. As we think about the remainder of \u201821 and \u201822 and what you\u2019ve got going on with retention and the value injections, and it sounds like a ton of good things going on, on the acquisition side. Should we expect an acceleration in net card fee growth over coming quarters?\nJeff Campbell: So, Chris, as I said in my remarks, we feel really good about the net card fee growth. In fact, I\u2019d like to point out that the dollars that we have grown net card fees by about -- more than $300 million a quarter since 2019, interestingly, kind of offsets the drop in net interest income, and we have a lot further to go. All that said, as most of you know, the accounting for card fees is a little complicated because we amortize people\u2019s card fee payments over 12 months after they pay them. And so, that causes the trends to move slowly. So, I\u2019ve said through much of this year that I expected card fee growth, because we weren\u2019t acquiring a lot of new card members last year, to slow quite significantly in the back half of the year. I will tell you now that with the tremendous progress on bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise, I think you might see a little bit of slowing in the next couple of quarters before it reaccelerates next year. But boy, it\u2019s a lot less than we originally anticipated. The other thing I would remind people of is it\u2019s really bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise that drives that card fee growth. And in fact, when you think, Steve, about the Platinum Refresh that you talked about, while we raised the fee for existing Card Members, that fee actually doesn\u2019t hit until their anniversary date next year. And then, once it hits, we\u2019ll amortize it over 12 months. So, it\u2019s a lovely long tailwind, but it\u2019s not going to be the driver of the next couple of quarters.\nSteve Squeri: And the only point I\u2019d make is when you look at that net card fees, the absolute dollars continue to grow. And so, -- and that\u2019s a direct result of the retention efforts.\nJeff Campbell: Yes.\nOperator: And next question is from the line of Moshe Orenbuch, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Thanks. And I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about the 40% of variable customer engagement costs and how to think about that in the coming years. One of the things that -- you\u2019ve obviously had tremendous success and you alluded to them in the prepared remarks in terms of the spending on the co-brand cards, but some of those contracts have kind of both volume levels and accelerators. If I recall, the Delta co-brand was supposed to accelerate it to 2023 in terms of the payments. Can you talk a little bit about that -- your views on that 40%?\nJeff Campbell: Well, a couple of comments, Moshe. First, because of the effects of the pandemic, the variable customer engagement costs sort of have been flowing with revenues. But if you go back a year, you had our Card Members suddenly not redeeming travel-related benefits, not traveling around, and that caused some unusual declines. Boy, the good news now is they\u2019re back traveling. And that recovery means that now we\u2019re back incurring some of those costs. And that makes the year-over-year, when you look at it just for the quarter, look a little unusual. That\u2019s why for simplicity purposes, we\u2019ve said, look, we\u2019re running at about 40% of total revenues. I\u2019d expect that to be the case for the next few quarters. Next year, we\u2019ll have to see how all parts of the business are performing. I guess, if I step back from all the math though, I would just say it\u2019s very good thing to see our members back engaged with our travel-related benefits. We feel really good about the value propositions we have in the marketplace given the kind of acquisition and retention numbers Steve talked about. And it\u2019s those Card Member engagement costs to drive that tremendous attachment for our existing customers and the ability to attract new customers. So, I think, the 40% is a good number for the next few quarters. And we\u2019ll have to see where it ends up next year, and we\u2019ll give you an update.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: I had a question about retention. You\u2019ve been highlighting the strength in retention throughout the pandemic. And just taking a peak at the supplementals, it looks like you\u2019re up 2.1 million in cards in force on 2.4 million in cards acquired. So, that is, in fact, very good retention. Can you just talk a bit about what\u2019s been driving that, and whether or not you think it will persist after the pandemic? And so, can we expect sustained growth in cards in force going forward?\nSteve Squeri: Well, look, I think as I said, I think some of the decisions that we made around value injection, some of the decisions we made around providing relief. But I will tell you, I think the largest thing that drove retention at the beginning of this pandemic, not a lot of companies were answering the phone. And our customer satisfaction scores from a servicing perspective really went through the roof for us during the pandemic. We pivoted people to home very, very quickly. We had equipment at the ready for them and they felt safe, they felt secure and they were able to take care of our customers. And so, at that time, people called American Express, we would then help them. And if you think about the help that we provided to people, it was -- I\u2019m not -- I can\u2019t take my trip, I\u2019m canceled, I had tickets to this, I had -- whatever it might have been, and we were able to help. And when you help somebody one time, that\u2019s a lifetime savior, because they\u2019ll always remember it. And the reality is, I think it was the combination of outstanding customer service because more people needed customer service during this pandemic than they ever did before, especially with cancellations of events. And I think we stood out. I think, we stood out among everybody else, once again, and I think the value injection and the financial relief programs. And we have continually look to engage with our customers throughout the pandemic and meet their needs. So, our hope is -- and we\u2019re seeing it persist right now is that we\u2019ll continue to retain these customers and build their loyalty. But I wouldn\u2019t -- I would not downplay customer services role in this retention. I can\u2019t tell you how many emails and letters I got that people were calling out to say, look, I was on hold with somebody for five hours. And I went to you and you guys were able to handle it. You answered the call in four or five minutes. So I think that really helped a lot, Lisa, I really do.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rick Shane of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: I\u2019m curious, when you think about the 80% recovery of T&E in the fourth quarter, how important corporate travel is to that recovery? And the reason I raised that is I think there\u2019s an important distinction between leisure travel, which has a long-planning cycle and business travel, which tends to have a much shorter planning cycle. And I\u2019m assuming that that short planning cycle creates volatility in terms of your expectations. And I\u2019m curious how much upside downside there is associated with that corporate travel?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. I would say very little downside because we\u2019re assuming -- we\u2019re not assuming very much. And we\u2019re just using ourselves as an example. There are a lot of companies that are still not even back yet, right? And it\u2019s hard to travel when you\u2019re not back. That\u2019s -- and it\u2019s hard to travel when there\u2019s nobody to travel to. I think New York is a little bit different phenomenon in financial services here. But the reality is, is we\u2019re not assuming very much from a corporate travel perspective, minimal improvement from really where we are. So, the downside volatility, I think, is negligible. The upside is pretty positive. But again, we\u2019re not anticipating a lot of travel. Having said that, corporate travel will come back. Anybody that believes that Zoom, WebEx or Google Meets or Microsoft Teams or what have you is going to take the place of face-to-face, it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s not. I think it\u2019s a great supplement. But ultimately, people will get back. But people are still antsy about getting out there but not so much for consumer travel. They\u2019re pretty willing to get out for consumer travel, but they are a little bit -- again, I think for corporate travel, it\u2019s a different thing. But, the reality is it will come back. And I think there is nothing like face-to-face interaction and business -- and doing business that way. And so -- but I see it more as upside, Rick, and not a volatile downside. Now, having said that, if it does come back and then goes down, that\u2019s when the volatility comes in. But I think behavior, once it shifts back to corporate travel, I believe will stay there.\nJeff Campbell: And Rick, the only numbers I\u2019d add to that is, yes, we expect Q4 to be at about 80% overall, led by consumer though, to Steve\u2019s point. So, I\u2019d expect global consumer to be at 95% probably of 2019 levels, the U.S. consumer at or above 2019 levels. And of course, the other thing, Steve, that\u2019s interesting is small businesses even now are traveling more than the large businesses.\nSteve Squeri: Right.\nJeff Campbell: It\u2019s the large businesses where you really don\u2019t see any signs of life right now. And we\u2019re not counting on any.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark DeVries, Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. Just a quick clarification and a bigger picture question. On the higher end guidance for 2021, does that contemplate reserve releases that get you down around kind of the CECL day-one level? And then kind of big picture, for Steve, what\u2019s your experience been historically on the impact of wealth effects on spend? Because obviously, if you look at, since the beginning of last year, there have been some pretty significant wealth effects for a lot of your cardholders. And what implications that may have for kind of where spend levels can recover to once your customers don\u2019t have the same restrictions on their activities?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, well, I\u2019ve said this many times, consumers like to consume. And so, giving opportunities to consume, they will start consuming. And I\u2019ve been here a long time. And I remember, after 9/11, people sort of didn\u2019t travel and sort of hoarded a little bit. And then all of a sudden, it exploded. And if you look back historically, you saw tremendous growth for us after 9/11. And it wasn\u2019t in travel. I mean, people started to spend on their homes, spend on other lifestyle choices and things like that. And then eventually travel came back. And so, I think the wealth of -- if you look at the savings that has accumulated within the United States and the wealth that is accumulated from stock appreciation and what have you, I think that only bodes well for us for people to continue to spend. And so, I would anticipate -- and again, we saw this right after 9/11, and we saw this after the financial crisis as well. I\u2019ve been -- it just tells you I\u2019ve been around a long time. And I think that will actually happen. But we\u2019ve never seen -- I haven\u2019t seen wealth accumulation like this across the continuum when you look at the overall savings rate and then just look at where the stock market is, obviously at an all-time high. So, I think that really bodes -- that bodes well for us as we think about spending going forward. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re bullish on \u201822 and beyond.\nJeff Campbell: And on the credit reserves, Mark, I\u2019d point out, on slide 14, in dollar terms, we are actually already below the dollar reserves that we had day one of CECL, $4 billion now versus $4.3 billion. What\u2019s still above, however, day one is the percent of the actual loans outstanding that the reserves represent. If you think about that $8.75 scenario, certainly, I would anticipate that that includes some reserve releases that bring that percentage below the day one CECL percentage. The unknowable question at this point is how far below. But, when you think about the credit metrics right now, it would suggest that your reserve levels, once all the various kinds of uncertainty work themselves through, it would suggest that your reserves as a percentage of loans outstanding should be significantly lower.\nOperator: And next question is from the line of Bill Carcache, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Your lens [ph] centric competitors have been very focused on elevated payment rates. Is Amex at all focused on stepping in to capture greater share of balance growth as payment rates normalize? I know capturing your fair share of balances that Amex customers carry with competitors was a big focus pre-pandemic. But I would appreciate any color on whether this is an opportunity that you\u2019re actively looking to pursue now.\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think obviously, during the pandemic, that obviously slowed down, but we\u2019re back at it. And the reality is we can be back at it, but if they\u2019re not going to revolve balances, it really doesn\u2019t -- it doesn\u2019t matter. But we have opened up again, obviously. We tightened up -- just to remind everybody, we tightened up our credit controls pre-pandemic. And that allowed us to go in pretty quickly and I think do a lot of really good things for our customers and for ourselves. But, we\u2019ve opened it up this year. And we\u2019re out there looking to acquire balances. We\u2019re not going to do crazy stuff, but we\u2019re looking at acquiring balances where it makes sense. And what I mean acquiring balances, I\u2019m not talking about fee free -- zero interest rate, things like that. What I\u2019m talking about is engaging with our customers to see what their revolve needs are and to see if we can meet those needs, whether it be through a pay plan it or whether it be through a consumer personal loan or whether it just be through a normal card revolve product. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Don Fandetti, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Steve, could you provide an update on the Amazon small business co-brand partnership? And also whether it would make sense to look at the consumer co-brand, if that were to come to market? It seems like a deal you don\u2019t necessarily need but maybe it makes sense in some areas.\nSteve Squeri: Well, look, here\u2019s what I would say. We are really happy with our overall Amazon relationship, and that is a multifaceted relationship. Not only do we buy Amazon services from them, but small business has been -- I think has been a good thing for both of us. I think it\u2019s been good for our customers. I think we\u2019ve been able to offer some great value. A lot of our customers use it as a companion product. And so, that\u2019s worked. I think our Pay with Points efforts with Amazon has really worked. And what I would say about co-brand opportunities, look, we look at them all. That makes sense. And we look at -- predominantly, we\u2019ve had a lot of travel co-brands, obviously. We\u2019ve also had other co-brands, and people will remember the Costco co-brand, but we\u2019ve also have a Lowe\u2019s co-brand for the small business. Obviously, we have the Amazon co-brand for Small Business as well and not just in the United States, but in a couple of other markets. And we look at the opportunities. And what we do is we look at those opportunities, and can we provide a value proposition that makes sense to our customers and can we do that in an economical way. And an economical way may not just be the economics of the co-brand deal itself. It may also be the economics of what a co-brand could do to the overall portfolio, both positively and negatively. And so, there\u2019s a lot of things you look at when you evaluate a co-brand. And we\u2019ll do what\u2019s right for our customers and our shareholders.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Bob Napoli, William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Good morning, Steve and Jeff. A question on the related, I guess, the SMB market itself and the competitive environment, you\u2019ve seen new players coming into that market, whether it\u2019s somebody like Square or there are a number of fintechs that are doing charge cards with spend management attached to it. Maybe just some thoughts on the importance of the growth of SMB, what you\u2019re doing, and how you view that? Any change in the competitive environment? And what new value injections that maybe not in that term, but products or services you\u2019re looking to add in maybe U.S. and international?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. Well, I think -- let me just -- I\u2019ll just mention international. International, right now, certainly a different competitive environment internationally than in the United States. There\u2019s not one competitor. It\u2019s competitors by market. But I would say, at the moment, not a hotbed of activity, small businesses. The viability of a number of small businesses in international markets, not a lot of people have line of sight into those right now. And we\u2019re not growing anywhere near like we used to grow. If you remember, small business international, high double digits, high double-digit teens for two, three years in a row. And we think we can get back to that. We just don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t see that happening this year, and we\u2019re not counting on it for next year. But, internationally, you\u2019re competing with local banks and so forth. And again, we\u2019ve done Amazon deals in multiple countries. And I think that has helped. And we continue to look for partnerships where they make sense. In the United States, we continue to grow. In fact, June was one of our best acquisition months in the history of our small business card in the United States. So, we\u2019re really pleased with that. There is a lot of competition. There\u2019s a lot of fintechs. There are banks out there. Capital One is aggressive, U.S. Bank is aggressive, JP -- everybody is aggressive in this space. And ultimately, it comes down to value, and we continue to grow. And again, here, from a Small Business perspective, I think we did a nice job with value injection. I think you will see us continue our strategy of product refreshes over the coming year. But, I think one of the big things that we\u2019ve done obviously is the Kabbage acquisition. And just last month, we launched the Kabbage checking account, the working capital, cash flow analysis and so forth. And what you\u2019ll see ultimately is that Kabbage platform being the landing point for our small businesses. And the way you want to think about this is fintech with scale. And so, when you think about Kabbage, which is a pure-play fintech in the small business space and you think about American Express and the small businesses and you combine that together, you have a fintech at scale, not a fintech growing at scale, a fintech growing from scale, from scale with the balance sheet. And so, that has always been the vision of Kabbage. We\u2019ve made -- as you bring Kabbage into the bank holding company structure, you have to do some other things to future-proof it, if you will, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. But that\u2019s what you will see. Ultimately, what you will see is a fintech with traditional bank scale and a very strong balance sheet, and we\u2019ll continue to add products as we move along on to that platform. And that was the vision, right? I mean we see a lot of other people out there doing those kinds of things. But to be able to do that at scale from the get-go, I think, is a big win for us. So, that\u2019s a long -- that\u2019s the vision in the medium term here for Kabbage. And we just launched that platform from an Amex perspective just last month with those other products on it.\nOperator: And our final question will come from the line of Craig Maurer, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: I really wanted to ask about the competitive environment in high-end U.S. consumer, considering we just saw Citi shutdown their platinum competitor going forward. Has the U.S. premium consumer race really just boiled down now to two competitors, Amex and Chase? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the best way to answer it. Look, I don\u2019t know what Citi\u2019s strategy is. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s just a pullback for now from a -- to a reentry. That\u2019s a possibility. I know Wells is looking to get stronger in this space. And so, what we\u2019re really focusing on, Craig, is -- what we\u2019re focus in on is developing the best product possible and to make sure we could take on all comers. And some may say in the middle of pandemic, you\u2019re relaunching your Platinum Card and you\u2019re raising the fee. Yes, we are. Why? Because that was part of the strategy. We learned a lot during the pandemic as well. We were able to enhance the product. When you look at it, we added $1,400 worth of additional value for $140 worth of additional cost. And that\u2019s a great example of leveraging our partnerships, leveraging our knowhow, leveraging the digital assets that we have, whether that be Resy or LoungeBuddy or what have you within that overall collection. And so, yes, maybe it might look like right now, it\u2019s Chase and American Express. And Chase is a very formidable competitor with very smart people who are working really hard to beat us, and we\u2019re working really hard to beat them. But, I\u2019m not assuming it\u2019s going to be just us and Chase for long. I think you will see other people I think try and get in this game. And our Platinum Refresh is another shot across the bow. And anybody that really wants to come in and play with us -- and play in this game, we\u2019re ready. And we\u2019ll continue to up our game and up our service and provide even more and more value to our card members. And look, as I said in my remarks, the Platinum Refresh last time worked, and that was in the face of JPMorgan Chase entering in with a strong product. And we believe it\u2019s going to work this time in early results. And obviously, we\u2019re only in for three weeks here. But, if you just do the value calculation, it is a really strong product. And we\u2019re really proud of what we put out in the marketplace.\nVivian Zhou: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Vivian. And hello, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. Early this morning, we reported first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.74. I'm pleased to say, that our overall core business performance was slightly better than our expectations with credit performance continuing to be best-in-class. And we're especially encouraged about the progress we're making toward our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022. As I discussed in January, we're looking at 2021 as a transition year, where our focus is \u2013 is on investing to rebuild growth momentum by firing up our core business, scaling next horizon opportunities, while continuing to retain financial flexibility. And while I feel good about our results for the quarter, what I feel really good about is the progress we're making to rebuild momentum. When we talk about firing up the core, we're looking for meaningful progress in four areas, spending volumes coming back to pre-pandemic levels, bringing new customers into the franchise, retaining and deepening relationships with our current customers, and signing up additional merchants. We're making good progress in all these areas. Overall, spending on American Express cards in Q1 continued the sequential improvements we saw through the last two quarters of 2020. US volumes exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and spending in March from US consumer and small business - small and medium sized enterprise customers was higher than March 2019 levels. Non-US volume lagged a bit due to renewed lockdowns in certain international countries. Excluding travel and entertainment categories, spending on our cards in Q1 was up 11% on an FX adjusted basis versus 2019 levels. This marked the third straight quarter of positive growth. And although the T&E volumes were significantly lower in the first quarter versus last year, we've seen a steady sequential upward trend in monthly T&E spending, and a noticeable improvement in recent weeks, particularly in the US as the vaccine rollout accelerated. These trends indicate that the pent-up demand for consumer travel we've been talking about is real. And it increases our confidence that the domestic \u2013 that domestic consumer travel will continue to recover as the year progresses. In terms of bringing new customers into the franchise, card acquisitions are also gaining momentum, and were up sequentially in the quarter globally. In fact, new accounts acquired on key premium US consumer and small business products were above 2019 levels and exceeded the prior quarters. Initial spending on these new cards is strong. And the average FICO scores of these new US consumer and small business card members are higher than those acquired pre-pandemic. In addition, card acquisitions in some of our largest travel co-brand portfolios have accelerated since the fourth quarter, an important indicator that travel remains an attractive category for consumers over the long term. Another indicator of building momentum in our core business is retaining and increasing engagement with existing card members. We have a good story to tell here as well. Card Member attrition on our proprietary products, which also includes our co-brands continues to be lower than in the previous years, and customer satisfaction levels remain higher than pre-COVID levels. The additional value we provided on several of our premium products help drive Card Member loyalty and spending in 2020. And as we believed has been sustained into this year. For example, 95% of US Platinum Card Members who took advantage of the streaming credits, and 88% who used wireless credits offered last year are continuing to spend in these categories months later. We're also seeing good engagement on the new offers we rolled out earlier in the first quarter for Platinum Card Members, which include statement credits with PayPal and other select merchants. The uptake on these offers are in line with the wireless and streaming offers we announced last year. Overall Card Member engagement with our digital channels and capabilities is at an all time high in most areas. For example, over 88% of our US Card Members are making their payments digitally and 87% use our website or app for self-service. The number of Amex offers redeemed in Q1 increased fivefold versus last year's first quarter, topping 5.3 million redemptions. Finally, we continue to see strong adoption of Pay It Plan It, our Buy Now Pay Later feature after we recently expanded the capability to all US consumer cards. Since launching Pay It Plan It, card members have created over 6 million plans totaling over $5 billion of accounts receivable. Another key driver momentum is expanding merchant coverage. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress growing merchant coverage internationally, while maintaining our coverage levels in the US.  When it comes to building momentum, we aren't just focused on the near term, we're also focused on scaling next-horizon opportunities that will drive growth over the longer term. China represents an exciting opportunity in this regard. As you know, developing our card processing network in Mainland, China has been a priority for us and we're pleased with our progress. Since getting the green light to start processing payments in China eight months ago, we have reached mobile wallet parity coverage through our partnerships - partnerships with China's major mobile wallet providers. And to date, we have added over 14 million merchants to the network at the point of sale with more to come. A key enabler of our coverage growth in China is the progress we're making to modernize our network, particularly in adding the capability to process debit transactions globally which is an essential need for customers in China and helps us prepare for potential additional debit applications elsewhere. We remain focused on scaling our China business by acquiring card members through the relationships we've established with 16 issuing partners, and I look forward to sharing more highlights of our progress over the course of the year. In our commercial business, our growth has - has been and will continue to be driven primarily by small and medium-sized enterprises. A key element of our longer-term growth strategy for SMA franchise is to deepen our relationships with current customers and attract new ones by offering a range of supplier payment and cash flow management solutions, both on and beyond the card, giving business owners more tools to help them manage their businesses. Kabbage is one example of how we plan to bring this strategy to life. We've been focused on integrating Kabbage's digital capabilities into our business. And in Q1, we began the rollout of the Kabbage platform, which includes a business checking account and working capital solutions to our small business customers. In our consumer business, Resy, our online dining platform, helps drive bookings and spending at restaurants, which is a top category for our card members. When the pandemic hit, Resy quickly pivoted its value proposition for restaurant owners to help them expand their offerings and find new ways to attract customers, including enabling takeout, meal kits, family meals, and virtual events. Resy also provided a number of special offers for Amex card members. As a result, over the past year, Resy has seen significant growth in engagement for both consumers and restaurants. In fact, we've seen a number of reservations booked on the platform more than doubled since December and Amex card members who use Resy are some of our highest spending and most profitable customers. Those are just some of the examples of our progress in rebuilding our growth momentum, both in our core business and with next-horizon opportunities. Importantly, as we've increased our investments in both categories, we've also been focused on maintaining our financial strength and flexibility. We resume share repurchases this quarter and our capital ratios continue to be well above our targets. Before I hand the call over to Jeff, I want to share some thoughts on where I see things heading in the near term. As I sit here a little over a year since the globe - global COVID pandemic started, I'm optimistic that the hopeful signs we're seeing as vaccine distribution accelerates will continue and get stronger as we move through the year. Of course, we're still cautiously keeping our eye on - on the progression of the virus - virus and its impact on local lockdowns and cross-border travel restrictions in certain areas. But there are clear indicators that the economy is improving, particularly in the US and I believe this will translate into continued steady improvements for American Express. Given all of this, we remain firmly committed to executing on our 2020 investment strategy for a building growth momentum for the longer term. As I said last quarter, we're not focused on achieving a particular EPS target this year. Instead, we're focused on achieving our aspiration of returning to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 and 2022. And for the company to be positioned to execute on our financial growth algorithm going forward. I'm encouraged by the results we've seen thus far in 2021, which makes me even more confident in our roadmap for achieving our 2022 aspiration. I'm particularly proud of our colleagues who have remained nimble and focused through the uncertainties of the past year, their dedication and hard work, along with the flexibility of our business model, the loyalty of our customer base, the strength of our partnerships, and the value of our brand make me feel very good about the future. Jeff, will now walk you through our results and we'll - we will take questions after that.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today and talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a good progress toward the aspirations we have for 2022 that Steve just outlined. As I've said since the beginning of the pandemic last year, the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends, along with, this year, the marketing investments we are making to rebuild growth momentum. I'll spend most of my time this morning on these topics. But first, looking at the summary financials on slide three, when you consider year-over-year results, last year's first quarter included two months of pre-pandemic results. And so, as you would expect, first quarter revenues of $9.1 billion were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. But in contrast, while we don't typically look at monthly results, were you to look at our revenues in just the month of March, you'd see that they were up 7% year-over-year. Our first quarter net income was $2.2 billion and earnings per share was $2.74. Included in these results is a $1.05 billion credit reserve release due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and continued strong credit performance. So, now, let's get into the first key driver of our performance, volumes. Beginning with a few comments on some nomenclature changes we have made to our volume reporting. Thinking ahead on how we expect our card processing network in Mainland, China to grow in the coming quarters and years, we have renamed what we previously called GNS bill business as processed volumes, because our business model in China is unique and different from what we do with our GNS partners in other regions. We have also changed what we previously referred to as proprietary billed business to just billed business and renamed what we used to call our overall volumes from billed business to network volumes. You will see we've recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release, as well as on appendix, slide 27. So, with these changes in mind, moving on to our volume performance on slide four, we saw continued recovery across all of our volumes in the first quarter with total network and billed business volumes down 8% and 9%, respectively, and process volumes down only 1%, all on an FX-adjusted basis. Getting into the details of our billed business growth, which you will see several views of on slides five through 10, we've shown first quarter trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 in order to provide a clearer picture of how spending is recovering as we begin to lap the onset of the pandemic in March of last year. I'd also note that the trends we've seen in the first two weeks of April are a continuation of the trends we saw exiting the first quarter that I'll focus on this morning. In addition, it remains important to look at spending on travel and entertainment categories separately from spending in other categories, which we will now be calling goods and services spending, given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these two very different categories. Overall, there are a few key points I'd suggest is the takeaways on volumes from all of these slides. First, there are clear signs of volume momentum that we feel good about. As you can see on slide five, our overall billed business volume growth continued to recover steadily throughout the months of the first quarter, with the reopening of the economy and rollout of the vaccines progressing well in the US and certain other geographies. Spending on goods and services, which represents the vast majority or 86% of our volumes, exceeded our expectations, growing 6% year-over-year and up 11% versus 2019 in the quarter and up 15% in the month of March. Spending on travel and entertainment also showed sequential improvement given the progress on the medical front in the US, further reinforcing our view that consumer and small business travel will recover over time. Second, the growth in goods and services spending has continued to improve steadily in both our consumer and commercial businesses. In consumer, shown on slide six, we continue to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, which was up 23% year-over-year this quarter, even as the recovery of offline spending accelerated, driving goods and services volumes up 7% year-over-year and 13% versus 2019. In commercial, as you can see on slide seven, SME spending remains the most resilient across our customer types, supported by continued growth in B2B spending, which drove overall commercial spend on goods and services up 5% year-over-year and up 8% versus 2019 in the first quarter. Third, we are seeing a faster pace of spending recovery in the US versus other regions. As shown on slide eight, the total volumes from our US consumer and SME customers are recovering faster than other customer types and were up 1% versus 2019 levels in the month of March, even with the continued drag of T&E spend not yet fully recovering. International consumer and SME spending, on the other hand, is recovering more slowly due to renewed restrictions in key international geographies and the fact that, historically, we tend to have more travel-related spending in our international regions. And large and global corporate card spending, which historically has been primarily travel and entertainment, continued to be down the most during the first quarter, as we expected, since this will be the last customer type to see travel recover. Fourth, T&E spending though still down significantly, did improve steadily across all categories throughout the months of the first quarter. And consumer T&E continued to recover faster than that of SMEs and large corporations, as you can see on slides nine and 10. We expect this trend to continue given the pent-up demand to travel that we see in our consumer base and the positive early signs of domestic travel recovery that we see in the US as the vaccine rollout progresses. So to sum up on spending volumes, we feel good about the steady growth we are seeing in goods and services spending, and we expect it to continue to grow throughout 2021. On T&E spending, the trends we've seen in the first quarter are encouraging and give us more confidence in our current assumption that by Q4, T&E spending will have recovered to around 70% of its Q4 2019 levels, led by recovery in US consumer domestic travel. Turning next to the other key volume driver, receivable and loan balances, on slide 11. Receivable balances were down 4% sequentially and 6% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with spending volumes. Loan balances, however, were down 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, more than spending volumes, as we continued to see the liquidity and strength among our customer base leading to higher paydown rates, which relates to the very strong credit performance, I'll talk about in just a moment. Looking forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes. So turning next to our second key driver, credit and provision, on slides 12 through 16. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. We continue to see extremely strong credit performance with card member loans and receivables write-off dollars, excluding GCP, down 53% and 82% year-over-year, respectively, as you can see on slide 12. We attribute this performance to our robust risk management practices, the premium nature of our customer base, as well as the unprecedented level of government stimulants and forbearance programs. Clearly, macroeconomic forecasts have improved over the last 90 days, as you can see on slide 13. However, we still have two very different macroeconomic forecast scenarios, and we continued to put significant weight on the downside scenario in the modeling we did to calculate our first quarter credit reserves. The impact of the improvement in the set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models, coupled with the sequential decline in loan and receivables balances and our strong credit performance, led us to release $1.05 billion of reserves. This reserve release and our extremely low write-offs drove a provision expense benefit of $675 million in the first quarter, as shown on slide 14. That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $2.1 billion higher than they were pre-pandemic, as you can see on slide 15. In the coming quarters, we will see how the card members exiting our financial relief programs will perform. That will be an important milestone for us, though I would observe that all of the early exit performance indicators have looked quite strong. There also continues to be some uncertainty in the medical environment and the vaccine rollout, and we'll have to see how that plays out. And so we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. Slide 16 shows you this and that we ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of reserves, representing 6.4% of our loan balances and 0.5% of our card member receivable balances, respectively. Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to rebuild growth momentum on slide 17. We invested $1 billion in marketing in the first quarter as we continued to ramp up new card acquisitions, while maintaining our value-injection efforts. We acquired 2.1 million new cards in the first quarter, up around 20% sequentially. Importantly, the number of new accounts we acquired on our premium fee-based products was up 35% versus Q4, with acquisition volumes on many of our premium US consumer and small business products exceeding 2019 levels. As Steve mentioned, in 2021, our focus is on rebuilding growth momentum and maximizing our investments to do so. As a result, we continued to expect to spend a little over $4.5 billion in marketing this full year. Our ultimate marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities and the pace at which we wind down our value-injection efforts, as our customers begin again to experience the full benefits of our existing value propositions. So what do our three key drivers mean for our financial performance this quarter? As I said earlier, year-over-year revenues on slides 18 and 19 are impacted by the prior-year quarter, including two pre-pandemic months. So first quarter revenues were down 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, primarily driven by volume declines impacting net discount revenue and net interest income, as well as declines in travel-related revenues and delinquencies impacting other commissions and fees and other revenues. Net card fees, however, grew 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 20, demonstrating the impact of the strong continued card member engagement that Steve discussed. Looking forward, I expect the growth rate of net card fees will slow for a few more quarters, driven by our decision last year to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the beginning of the pandemic. Given the renewed momentum, we are now beginning to see new card acquisitions. I would expect net card fee growth to then reaccelerate. Moving on to net interest income on slide 21, you see that net interest income declined 22% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. While the primary driver of this is the decline in loan volumes, net interest yield on our card member loans also decreased 60 basis points due to the higher paydown rates from revolving card members on our credit card products. Looking forward, I expect the recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes. Volumes are also the primary driver of the discount revenue trends you see on slide 22. As expected, though, the contraction in discount revenue continued to be a bit larger than the decline in billed business. The average discount rate declined 8 basis points year-over-year, driven by the greater declines we saw in T&E spending where we, on average, earn higher discount rates. The year-over-year erosion in the first quarter is a bit less than in Q4 due to the recovery in T&E spending throughout the quarter that I spoke about earlier. Looking forward, we still expect that if T&E spending recovers to around 70% of 2019 levels by Q4, as I mentioned previously, you'd probably see overall revenue growth of around 9% to 10% for full year 2021. And if T&E recovers more slowly or quickly, you could see full year revenue growth but somewhat lower or higher than that 9% or 10%. Moving on to expenses, we are continuing to break out on slide 23 our variable customer engagement expenses, which move naturally in line with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx, which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were down 10% year-over-year. Relative to the past few quarters, we did experience higher usage of travel-related benefits and rewards, which we see as a clear sign of the pent-up demand we've been talking about. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the next few quarters. Moving on to operating expenses, you can see that they were down 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio, partially offset by some higher deferred and other compensation expenses. In 2021, we still expect our operating expenses to be around $11.5 billion, below 2019 levels, as we continue to keep tight control over our operating expenses, while also investing to rebuild growth momentum. Turning next to capital and liquidity. On slide 23, our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 14.8% in the first quarter, our highest level since we began reporting this ratio. And our cash and investment balance ended the quarter at $61.5 billion, far above our target levels, driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year. We resumed share repurchases in the first quarter, repurchasing 3.3 million shares. And we remain committed to our dividend distribution and to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. In Q2, we plan to repurchase shares up to the maximum amount permitted under the Fed-authorized capacity of around $900 million. Looking forward, our capital distributions will be a function of the Fed's guidelines, our capital generation, and the growth in our balance sheet. So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in Q1 might mean for the future. In January, I laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily based on what happened with credit reserves. Our original scenario one, or low scenario, assumed a much worse medical and economic environment this year, and that we would not release any credit reserves in the year. Now, three months into the year, the macro outlook has improved, and credit performance has remained very strong. So we've already released $1.05 billion of reserves. This still leaves us, however, with a lot of credit reserves we've built due to economic uncertainty. So our updated scenario one on slide 25 assumes that this uncertainty persists that the medical and economic environment does not improve further and that we, therefore, do not release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of a 70% T&E recovery by Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS outcome as low as around $6 per share. Our updated scenario two in contrast assumes that we continue to see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty and having no need to maintain our current level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 9% to 10% revenue growth assumption I spoke about earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as $7.50. More importantly, in either scenario, as I said earlier, our marketing investment levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities that we see not by a focus on any specific EPS outcome for 2021. What we are focused on is managing the company to rebuild growth momentum and achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations that we had for 2020 and 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm beyond 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the line for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Alan?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: [Technical difficulty] 4% in March versus '19\u2026\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Don. Don, could you start again? We missed the beginning.\nDon Fandetti: Sure, no problem. So Jeff, if you look at your T&E down about 54% versus '19 in March and April sounds like it gained a lot of momentum, it looks like, you know, down 30% for Q4 would be pretty conservative. How are you thinking about that? And also, what are your T&E assumptions as you sort of look at your '22 aspirational guide?\nJeff Campbell: Well, maybe I'll start, and then, Steve, you might want to add a few comments. So let me work backwards. So in 2022, we're really assuming, Don, that consumer travel and entertainment spending is mostly back to where it was pre-pandemic. Small business lagging that a bit and then large and global corporation travel still being well below its 2019 levels. The other comment I would make about 2022 is domestic travel in the US and around the globe will be the fuel that gets us to that level. We would still expect cross-border travel to be a little weaker next year than it was in 2019, just given the likely lingering number of cross-border restrictions that you've seen. You know, as of how we feel about our Q4 assumption, look, you know, we had a clear inflection point this quarter in the US, and so we feel good. But Steve, you may want to add a few?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. No, I think that, you know, those - the assumptions that Jeff just went through are exactly the assumptions we have in our - in our calculus here. But I think when you look at - when you look at this quarter and you look at the trends that we're seeing, I mean, we're seeing an increase in bookings, right? So we're seeing our travel - our travel bookings are up 50% over the - this quarter up 50% over Q4 '20. When you look at - and we look at this really carefully, when you look at February versus March, in March now, you know, we were 50% of 2019 bookings, and that was 19%. So we have 31% in February and then went to 50%. So we feel - we feel really good about that. When we also start to really dig into the data, we start to look at, you know, sort of cohorts of spending. And we're seeing, you know, people that are younger are getting back at a much higher level. Their overall T&E spending is probably about 85% to 90% and, you know, almost 100% back to where they were in 2019 in restaurants. And then when we look at older people, as they get vaccinated, we're seeing sequential growth month-on-month, as we look at their growth. And so, if you look at, just people over 45, you're seeing an 11% increase in their overall T&E spending month-to-month. We - that's only going to get better for us as we move along. And the last - the last thing that, you know, gives us a lot of great hope is, is redemptions, is MR redemptions. I mean, you know, when you go back and look at sort of MR redemptions that we had, our MR point redemptions in the fourth quarter for air [ph] was like 30%, and it's up to 54%. So we are, you know, we're doing some good things here. And our customers are doing some good things. And we'll continue to make sure that we're retaining these customers because they're going to spend. And as, you know, Jeff said, our co-brand cards are doing quite well as well. So, you know, all of that leads to, again, in an environment that continues to improve, us having a lot of confidence in hitting our 2020 plan in 2022.\nDon Fandetti: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of - one moment, please. We'll go next to the line of Craig Maurer [Autonomous Research]. Go ahead, please.\nCraig Maurer: Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks. I hope everybody is well. I wanted to just ask about the guide a little bit for 2021. Versus your original scenarios that you laid out with fourth quarter earnings, how much higher was the reserve release than you had envisioned? I'm trying to understand how much pull forward of reserve release benefit might have happened in the first quarter because of how strong credit quality was and the fact that lending did not accelerate?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. So I think, Craig, the first comment I would make is, remember, we're not trying to provide guidance this year. We tried to give people a couple of low and high scenarios back in January to help people think about the year, and we updated them this quarter. What we are incredibly focused on is that 2022 aspiration, which we are really growing in confidence about. All that said, if I take you back to January, the then $5 low scenario assumed that the world would be so tough this year that you would not end up releasing any credit reserves. So we just released $1.05 billion of reserves. That's about $1. That takes you from $5 to $6. So your $6 assumes, once again, the world from here is suddenly going to get really tough, and you're not going to release any more reserves. At the high end, yes, we had assumed you release some modest level of reserves, which is why the high end only went up from $7 to $7.50. So that's how we thought about it. I just want to close though, by again emphasizing we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome this year. We're incredibly focused on what we're trying to achieve for 2022.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead, please.\nMark DeVries: Yeah, thanks. You know, I think that guidance around the corporate T&E spend makes a lot of sense. But Steve, I'd be interested in getting, you know, your color on recent conversations you're having with your large corporates on, when they think they'll feel comfortable having their employees travel more freely? You know, whether they'll recover to pre-pandemic levels? How much substitution of virtual occurs? And then finally, just given that, do you see more upside or kind of downside to that, that 70% of recovery level?\nSteve Squeri: All right. So, you know, when you think about corporate, the first thing people have to do is get back into the offices, right, because if people aren\u2019t back into the offices, there's nowhere to travel to. And you're starting to see - look, I mean, you know, Jeff and I are in here today with 80 of our closest friends in a building that, you know, has about 5,000 people. And we've said we're not going to have people really come back until after Labor Day. You're seeing other companies sort of gradually get back into it. So I think the step one. First step is let's get people back into the office, and then companies are going to say, okay, how comfortable I am having visitors into the building. And, you know, my anticipation is most companies will start opening - start the process of reopening in the United States now, July through, you know, sort of September, and get to some capacity level. I mean - and you guys have your own situations yourselves, where you're - most of you are probably sitting at home today. So, I think what's going to happen is it's going to be slow, which is why we really haven't assumed a lot of corporate T&E coming back and a lot of travel coming back. Having said that, corporate T&E takes many forms. You know, we do have salespeople that are on - out and on the road and calling on accounts. And there's car rental and there's gas, and they're still staying at hotels and restaurants. And so, you know, I think for a segment of it. And I think when you look at a segment of our, let's call them, industrial corporate T&E - corporate customers, they have people that are going to plants and visiting, you know, making customer calls and so forth. I think that eventually, what will happen is, you know, investment banks and consultants are going to want to go out and meet with their clients again. There is been a lot of deals that have been done, a lot of relationships that have been built. But, you know, there's nothing like in person. I just think, you know, it will take a bit of time. And, you know, look, there's also - there's that substitution. It's a substitution of WebEx and Zoom and what have you, which is why, you know, we've been talking 2023 before it gets back to 2019 levels. And I think, with that assumption, we feel good about hitting that 2020 aspiration in 2022. So when you think about what goes into our assumption for 2022, you've got a slower return of international. You've got a much lower return of corporate, and yet we're saying we'll be at 2020 levels. And so, you know, is there upside from a consumer perspective on travel? I think that all depends on the rollout of the vaccine, governments opening up their borders and things like that. I think, you know, from a domestic travel perspective, pent-up - there's pent-up demand. In talking to Ed Bastian and talking to Chris Nassetta, they're seeing a lot of bookings out front. I just went through some of our travel data. So, you know, as we go through this, I think what's going to be the key thing to watch for is how much does international travel come back from a consumer. And, you know, we're assuming that sort of now in the second half of 2022, okay. Not in - not really - not really this year. And I think the other thing you're seeing, Mark, is you're seeing a divergence. I mean, you see what's going on in India right now. There's a lot of countries that are having different results and different situations as it relates to the vaccine. But one thing is inarguable, the more vaccine rollout, the more people feel confident. The more people feel confident, the more they'll get out and spend. And that's why I think when you look at, you know, sort of the - toward the end of this second quarter into third quarter in the summer, you're going to see people hitting the road, you're going to see people hitting the skies, especially in the US.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Betsy.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: So my question is on the 2.1 million accounts acquired in the quarter. Maybe you could give us some color on the type of customer, you know, age bracket, income, geography, that kind of thing? And give us a sense of what's resonating, is it more the cash back, the T&E, the specific, you know, enhancements that you're making on, you know, some of the programs, spend more get more kind of points, bonus points. And a little bit on how you're thinking about this group of new accounts that you're acquiring and what that means for future spend trajectory and growth rates versus maybe what you were acquiring pre-pandemic if there's any, you know, compare contrast there you can share would be great? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Okay. Well, let me give you a couple. It's a probably a half hour meeting there. But let me go through. So look, 2.1 million new cards normally, you know, 2019, you saw us average about 2.5 million new cards. When you look at the consumer cards, 60% of the cards we acquired were millennial or Gen Z. We saw - in the pandemic, you saw more cash back cards being acquired. We're - you know, there was a 35% jump in premium cards that we saw in this particular quarter. And acquisition of platinum and gold cards was well above pre-pandemic levels. So we feel good about that. And just to give you some sort of contrast on that. When you look at our fee-based products, it's still a little bit lower. I mean, we're acquiring about 60%. It was about 70% in 2019, but sequential increases have helped. We're seeing co-brand cards come back. I mean, you know, we talked about 90% more Delta cards acquired in this quarter than in the - than in the previous - than in the previous quarter. And we're seeing a higher level customer. I mentioned that in my remarks, the FICO is a lot higher, and we're seeing good spending. So, you know, we feel good about both our small business and consumer. I would - we don't really talk about geographic distribution and things like that. But, you know, our intent is not only to acquire cards, but we also, when we talk about it, we acquire billed business. And we're on track to do from a billed business acquired perspective where we in 2019. So we feel good about that.\nJeff Campbell: You know, the other thing I'd add just to make it clear, Betsy, is that the sequential growth in the travel co-brands has been tremendous. They're still below where they were pre-pandemic because you still don't have anywhere near as many people staying at hotels or sitting on airplanes. And so that's what leaves us overall a little bit below the level of pre-pandemic new card acquisitions. But we're quite confident that we'll come back. And once you look beyond that sector, we think we're at great levels today.\nOperator: We will go next to the line of me Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about - dig a little bit more on the 70% by year-end T&E assumption. Is there - it sounds like there's a mix shift between volumes that do between domestic and international, weighted more toward domestic, which I think we all understand. But maybe - is there a difference in revenue or profitability between that travel in terms of what you make? So I guess what I'm trying to ask is as T&E comes back, is the contribution to revenue maybe going to lag a little bit on the - compared to the contribution to volume just from that mix shift? And then any update on April billing trends? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. No, so when we report the volume, it's the volume. And there's no - there's no different. Obviously, if people are booking first-class international tickets to Hong Kong, they cost a lot more than first-class tickets to Indianapolis. But the reality is we're giving you volume numbers. So it just means you need a lot more of those tickets to Indianapolis than you do to Hong Kong. So no, there isn't a difference for us. We're not giving you sort of - you know, when we talk about volumes, we're not giving you a number of trips booked here. What we're doing is we're giving you actual volume. So we may have actually more trips. In fact, when we look at - you know, we look at this, you'll - you know, we look at receipt of charges and transactions basically. So we may have more transactions in air and you may have lower dollar, but that doesn't - that doesn't mean anything to our margins.\nJeff Campbell: The only thing I'd add, Mihir, is when you look at our other revenue and other fee and commission lines, there is some in dollars in there that do come from cross-border travel. And as we think about the 2022 aspiration, we don't actually expect that to be fully back to 2019 levels in 2022. We don't need it to be to hit our 2022 aspirations. I'd actually put that in the category of things Steve talked about earlier that even beyond '22, there is still probably a couple of remaining tailwinds as the last of cross-border travel and corporate travel begin to come back to 2019 levels post 2022.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.\nMeng Jiao: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the recent expansion of Pay It Plan It to all US consumer products. Have you seen any sort of usage acceleration since you expanded that? And then can you actually frame for us how big the opportunity set can be, and if it could apply to that 2022 aspiration that you mentioned? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. No. So, you know, it's really too early to sort of - to tell on, you know, just how much we've got it, because we really just did it. But it's not really in the - you know, it's not in our calculus to help us make our 2022 number. It's totally - it's totally upside for us. But, again, just to put it in perspective, you're talking about 6 million plans from inception, you're talking about 5 billion of overall AR. And it's a convenience, you know, feature that - that we have. It's - yeah, I'd like to say it was our answer to Buy Now Pay Later, except we had it before a lot of the Buy Now Pay Later. We just had it on a particular card, and now we've put it on all the cards. So it really is all about meeting overall card members', you know, cash flow needs. And, you know, they'll do this versus potentially revolve on charge or, you know, just a normal lending transaction. It gives them more certainty. So it's in the overall numbers that we have and the overall spending that we have. But I wouldn't say in any way shape or form it's a big driver of 2022.\nOperator: We'll go next to line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. One moment. Your line is open, sir. Go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Steve and Jeff.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Bill.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning, Bill.\nBill Carcache: So you guys have done a very effective job of adjusting your pre-pandemic value propositions, but can you offer any thoughts on the work you've done more recently around potential post-pandemic changes and consumer preferences that may be longer - longer lasting and the risks that that could lead to more permanent changes? For example, how concerned are you guys about the risk that the value proposition associated with the airline lounges may not be as great post-COVID and how confident are you that you'll be able to identify sustainable cost-effective alternatives to maintain the overall value proposition across your different products to the extent that we can't just go back to the old, you know, sort of the older pre-pandemic offerings that you guys had?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. So a couple of points. So look, you know, our strategy for the last three years has been to refresh our products on an ongoing basis, ongoing basis anywhere from sort of three to four years. And so we'll talk more as we - as we refresh those products and we'll give you a little bit more color on that. I take the opposite view on sort of the travel value propositions. I think they're actually going to be even stronger at this point. I think that people are going to want to have the safety and security of our lounges. We're opening up more lounges. We're not backing away from these lounges. In fact, we've opened up numerous lounges during the pandemic and they've - they've turned into a little bit more of an oasis for people where they know with our brand, our security, and our reputation, we're going to take - take as good care of those - of people in our lounges as possible. And I think, the other thing that, you know, was a lot of questions we got at this time last year was what's the future of your travel co-brand cards? And when we look at the month of March and we look at sort of Delta and we look at Hilton, as just two examples, they're at 2019 spending levels, you know, overall. And because people have been accumulating points and people want status. And as I've said numerous times on these calls, status is probably even going to be more important going forward. So what we will continue to do is we're not going to walk away from our travel value propositions. If anything, I've been more encouraged that we did the right things, and we'll continue to add though. I mean, I think if you look at our history over the last three years or so, three and a half years, we've kept our core value proposition and continue to add. And during the pandemic, I talked about the results we had with wireless and the results we had with streaming. We got customers who were not using our card for those things, by putting some value in, we're now four months after the value and they're still spending. And we're doing the same thing, right now, we've got a PayPal credit for our platinum cardholders, and we're picking up more card members that didn't use PayPal. And as I've talked about PayPal and I've talked about some of the other Fintech Square and in Stripe and so forth, they've actually not only helped us get more coverage, but have helped us in ways to deliver more value to our card members. So we feel good about our card - our value propositions. We feel good about the travel value propositions that are in our products, but we will continue to expand and evolve our value propositions as we have over time. We're not walking away from that strategy.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So, Steve, maybe as a follow-up on that. So, you know, you injected significant value prop enhancements into the business like streaming and wireless as you just referenced, and I believe some of those will evolve over the next few quarters. So can you maybe just talk about how you envision repurposing those marketing dollars? I think, Jeff, you talked about spending a little over four and a half this year. Could we see that come down beyond this - beyond this year or do you expect to see these enhancements shifted toward customer acquisition and maybe we could see customer acquisitions above that, you know, those 2.5 million per quarter that you talked about in 2019? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. So a couple of points. We spent, I think it was like $1 billion this quarter. Some of that was in value injection, not the wireless and streaming. Those have ended. This is different types of value injection. But the majority of that was, you know, customer acquisition and customer engagement. When we look at the rest of the year, I think we said we're going to spend $4.5 billion. But we'll spend up to the attractive opportunities that are there. If there are not attractive opportunities, we will not spend it. If there are attractive opportunities, we will spend more if they are there, because we're focused on building that momentum. Having said that, given that you have sort of probably a six-month value injection window and you've got customer acquisition and customer retention, more than likely, you will see that overall dollar bucket come down next year, as we go into 2022 when you're not doing that value injection.\nJeff Campbell: The only thing I'd add, Ryan, is we've talked about the fact that as you go through this year, to Steve's point, you need to see the value injection spending come down. And we were pleased this quarter because actually it was down sequentially and we still continue to see tremendous customer attrition and retention rates further because the travel-oriented value parts of our value propositions are becoming more valuable to people again.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna Research. Go ahead, please.\nJamie Friedman: This is a very thoughtful IR deck so thank you for that and for the updated commentary. I just want to ask in slides seven, eight, nine, you demonstrate the outperformance of SME. You don't have to go to the slides just anchoring it. But in terms of the outperformance of SME, Steve and Jeff, could you remind us what it is about that relative to large and corporate that is different that makes it more sustainable? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So you can probably hear a shuffling of pages to get to seven, eight, nine. But yeah, so there is a huge difference. I mean, you know, so our corporate card is predominantly like 60% travel and entertainment, whereas our SME card is, you know, like 80% goods and services, they use the card to run their business. And you know, as we've talked about travel coming back, it comes back in layers. It comes back with consumer then it's SMB and then it's - then it's lodging corporate. So it is a very different business, which is why we went and acquired Kabbage to have a digital front for these SMEs where they can, you know, not only get their card spending done, but also get working capital loans, have a transaction banking account, have merchant financing loan, have short-term loans, and things like that. Because small businesses, small midsize businesses use this card to really help to run their businesses, which is a fundamental difference between how corporations use the card, which is to support T&E and obviously it is B2B opportunities with large corporates but that's why small business has come back. Why are small businesses have done I think even better than what you might have thought is - is the - the dispersion that we have across the small business arena. And I've said this many times, when people think about small businesses they tend to think about the small retail shop and they tend to think about the small restaurant. The reality is a lot of them didn't do so well during this time. We don't have a tremendous amount of our small business base. There is a very diverse base, and when you think about professional services, you think about, you know, cooling and plumbing and electric and all those things. You know, our base is very wide and that has helped us because some small business segments during this time have just been through the roof. Others have been hit really hard and others have, you know, businesses has - have maintained as they were before the pandemic.\nOperator: We'll go now to the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. Good morning, Steve and Jeff.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Bob.\nJeff Campbell: Hey, Bob.\nBob Napoli: Question on China, I guess, and in debit, as you know, broader thoughts on debit. So what do we - what should we see out of China? You've changed your reporting somewhat because it's your - you expect to see some significant numbers, I guess, out of China, but you've also talked about building a debit capability broader than China, and I just wondered what your long-term thoughts were on that?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. So I think, you know, we changed that to provide, I think, the appropriate level of transparency for you guys because, obviously, as we've said this all along, GNS volumes are not, you know, worth the same to us as GNS as proprietary volumes and China volumes are, you know, part of that - that mix. And so - that's why we change it to process funds. Because, yes, you're right, over time we do expect that volume to be very significant and we wanted to make sure we were providing the right level of insight so that you guys could make the right - the right assumptions. And there will be, you know, in China it'll be, you know, charge credit and it'll be debit cards. And so as we - as we build that capability, we will evaluate where else, you know, if we - if you build that capability for your network it gives you the capability to do it in other markets. And so we'll evaluate over time where that makes sense for us to roll that out. So nothing really to announce here, but I think it's important that you understand the capabilities that we're building as well and, you know, we're building these capabilities from a global perspective so that we have it. But to also point out, we do have GNS partners in local markets today that have debit products, have American Express debit products. They just tend to get used more locally within the country as opposed to around the world. And it's important, you know, at -at some point, we will have a lot of traveling Chinese card members and it's important that they're able to use all the products that we - that our partners issued to them all around the world, and debit being one of them.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\nRick Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. I know you guys have been on here a while. One of the consequences of the Card Act was that it shifted the competitive landscape from offering lower rates to higher rewards. And we think at the peak of the GFC recovery, that was particularly challenging for AXP because it had the impact of basically causing industry offers to converge to your core value propositions. One of the responses we saw from you is that you move onto your front foot in terms of targeting millennials for card acquisition. I'm curious as we sort of enter this new period of expansion and all of your competitors are talking about growth, what are the lessons you learned the last cycle in either tactically or strategically how will you respond?\nSteve Squeri: Well, you know, I have a different version of the Card Act than you do. I think our competitors got into this more after the financial crisis when they really looked at this and said this was a very attractive business. The reality is the Card Act had a lot less impact on us because remember, 80% of our revenues are not from interest and, you know, the fact that interest rates, especially on prior balances, were now controlled. You know, it really had less impact on us than it did and our competitors. Our competitors wound up just growing their overall business and one of the first things they did is hire a lot of people from American Express to do that. But you know, look, I think that, you know, the lessons that we've learned over time, and look, I've always said this, we welcome competition. The lessons that we learned over time is you need to continue to focus in on what your customer needs are and how your customer is changing and evolving. And this is why, when I took over, one of the first things I said is we're going to go to a strategy of refreshing our products on a real ongoing basis. You can not have your green card sit out there for 30 years and think it's still as relevant 30 years ago as it is today. Millennials, was really not, you know, not as much a Card Act. Millennials was us opening our eyes to the fact that our value proposition had a much broader appeal. And I think that we really started to communicate that and, you know, look, and I've said this publicly before, I think your company there did a great job of really highlighting premium cards. I'm talking about JPMorgan, and Gordon and his team did a fantastic job of highlighting premium cards to millennials. And you know, and our value proposition played remarkably well there. And as I just said, 60% of our cards that we just acquired are millennials. I think we had to expand our aperture and we did that. We expanded that aperture and we realized that the value proposition that we had could have a wider audience and could have a wider target. And we've done that and we will continue to do that. You will continue to see that from a multicultural perspective. You will continue to see that from millennials. You'll continue to see that, you know, with women as well. So I think what we learned is that since then is that there is a broader market for our products than we initially thought, number one. Number two, you always have to keep innovating and you have to innovate on a regular cycle basis, you can't stand on your laurels. And I would say that we learn more from, you know, some of our trials and tribulations with Costco than we did from the Card Act.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead, please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Most of my questions have been asked, but just a quick one on credit. Jeff, I think you mentioned you're still waiting toward the negative or a higher weighting toward a negative scenario in your reserve calculation. I'm just curious sort of how realistic that is given sort of where we are and where again delinquency rates here and the building momentum? Maybe you just talked about that. And then just one quick one on the expenses. You mentioned that the venture gains helping expenses this quarter. I mean, should we just view it as a one-time gain or how should we think about that, was that spent? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So on credit, Sanjay, you're correct. For the purposes of our accounting credit reserve, we did significantly wait for a downside scenario. And I think that's in keeping with a little bit of a regulatory view where you have the Federal Reserve saying to all banks, you know, we're still a little \u2013 why don\u2019t we see a little bit more time pass before we free everyone to go back to return into your appropriate capital levels. So we thought it was appropriate to be that conservative. But to be clear, the reserve that we have on the books implies that some - that steady recovery that we're in the midst of now just stops and things get worse. So if it doesn't then you would expect to see more reserves. The only other comment I'd make is it's April 23rd, you know, you're already at the point of the year where you really can't for the most part see write-offs go up significantly this year. Even if bad stuff happens, the actual write-offs would go into next year. On OpEx, yes, we did have a $377 million gain on the really great portfolio we have of Fintech investments. We have about 50 different companies, we have holdings, and we do partnerships for those companies and trading all about those partnerships. But the market's been pretty frothy lately so there was a big gain on a couple of those companies this quarter. There are also some offsets, you know, when the equity markets are frothy, our deferred comp balances are a bit of an offset or a hedge almost to the equity investments. I would really think of it, Sanjay, mostly as a one-time sort of thing this year. The reality is we're not focused on any particular EPS outcome. What we're focused on is to the extent we have good investment opportunities, you will see us use the financial strength we have right now to pursue those opportunities because we are laser-focused and increasingly confident of the aspiration we have for 2022.\nVivian Zhou: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company\u2019s progress and results and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. It\u2019s great to be with you to talk about our 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. As I go through our results, I will tell you why they strengthened my confidence in our plan to generate strong growth over the long-term. A year ago, we introduced our growth plan, which provided a roadmap for delivering annual growth rates for revenue and earnings per share at levels that are higher than the strong growth rates we were delivering before the pandemic. Our results over the last four quarters demonstrate that our strategy is clearly working. We exceeded the full year guidance we laid out in our growth plan for both revenues and EPS and we did so against the mixed economic environment. Revenues, which reached all-time highs for both the quarter and the year, were up 25% for the full year, exceeding the 18% to 20% guidance we started the year with. An earnings per share of $9.85 was well above our guidance of $9.25 to $9.65. The momentum we saw through the year in Card Member spending, engagement and retention continued in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter billed business reached a record quarterly high of $357 billion and was up 25% for the full year demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high spending premium card members. Customer retention and satisfaction remained very strong. In addition to strong internal metrics, we were recognized once again by our customers for providing industry best products and services, ranking number one in customer satisfaction in both the 2022 J.D. Power U.S. consumer credit card study and the U.S. small business card study. The investments we have made in our value propositions continue to attract large numbers of new premium customers. We acquired 3 million new card members in the fourth quarter even as we increased our already high credit thresholds through the year. For the full year, new card acquisitions reached a record level, growing at $12.5 million and nearly 70% of our new accounts acquired are on our fee-based products. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to be the largest drivers of our growth, representing over 60% of proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter and for the full year. Credit metrics remained strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our exceptional risk management capabilities and the thoughtful risk actions we have taken for the year. Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, let me tell you why these results increase my confidence that we are positioned to deliver on our growth plan aspirations. First, we are in a great business. We operate in the most attractive segments and geographies of the fast growing payment space. As highlighted by our leadership positions with premium consumers, including millennials and Gen Zers small and medium-sized businesses as well as serving the largest corporations in the world. We bring to this space a number of advantages that are very difficult for our competitors to replicate. These include our brand, our unique membership model, a premium global customer base and an integrated payments model. Forming the foundation of these advantages is our talented dedicated colleagues who deliver unparalleled service to our customers. Put together, the marketplace opportunities we see and the competitive advantages we can leverage create a long runway for growth. We intend to capture these opportunities and building our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas, continuously innovating our consumer and SME products, refining our powerful marketing and risk management engines and capturing our fair share of lending. Growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the U.S. and expanding partnerships to drive customer value across the enterprise, continuing to introduce new digital capabilities that deliver seamless, intuitive customer experiences in their channels of choice and expanding into adjacencies that reinforce our core, such as new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and SMEs, which adds more value to our membership model. All this investment happens while continually focused on gaining efficiencies in our marketing and operating expenses. As we have demonstrated consistently over the past 2 years, executing this investment strategy builds scale, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, it starts with a high spending, highly engaged premium customer base. These premium customers attract a growing network of merchants and partners who add more value to our membership model, which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers who attract more merchants and partners, which creates more scale. This scale enables us to generate more investment and operating efficiencies in our membership model making it more difficult for our competitors to catch up. So what does this mean for 2023? Our plan for this year is built on continuing our investment strategy in the areas I mentioned while factoring in the blue-chip economic consensus for slowing macroeconomic growth. And as always, we have plans in place to pivot should the economic environment change dramatically. This translates into 2023 guidance consistent with what we originally laid out in our growth plan last year. Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, which is higher than our long-term growth plan aspirations and EPS of $11 to $11.40. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.60 a share, up from $0.52 beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. To sum up, our 2022 performance shows that our strategy is working. And based on our performance to-date and what we see for 2023, I am even more confident in our ability to achieve our aspirations for double-digit annual revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Jeff to provide more detail about our performance. As always, we will have a Q&A session after Jeff\u2019s remarks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be here to talk about our \u201822 results, which reflects steady progress against our multiyear growth plan that we announced last January and also to talk about what our 2022 results mean for 2023. I will also spend some of our time this morning focusing on our full year trends since it is year-end and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we actually run the company. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2, full year revenues reached an all-time high of $52.9 billion, up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Notably, our fourth quarter revenues of $14.1 billion also reached a record high for the third straight quarter and grew 19% on an FX adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported full year net income of $7.5 billion and earnings per share of $9.85. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.07, which did include a $234 million impact from our net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. As I have said throughout the year, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the sizable credit reserve releases we had in 2021. Because of these prior year reserve releases, we have also included pre-tax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pre-tax, pre-provision income was $11.8 billion for the full year and $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 27% and 23% respectively versus the prior year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings. So now let\u2019s get into a more detailed look at our results, beginning with volumes, starting on Slide 3, we saw good quarter-over-quarter growth in volumes. I would note that we reached record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Total network volumes in billed business were up 16% and 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% and 25% for the full year, all on an FX-adjusted basis. Now of course, growth rates for quarters earlier in the year included more of a recovery on the lower levels of volumes in 2021. And we are now to the point where we have lapped the majority of this recovery. We are pleased with this growth and the fact that it is being driven across customer types and geographies. On Slides 4 through 7, we have given you a variety of views across our U.S. consumer services, commercial services and International Card Services segments and the various customer types within each. There is a few key points I suggest you take away from these various perspectives. Starting with our largest segment, U.S. consumer billings grew 15% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumers. Our focus on attracting, engaging and retaining younger cohorts of card members through our value propositions, drove the 30% growth in spending from our millennial and Gen Z customers on Slide 5, who you can now see make up 30% of spend within the segment. Turning to Commercial Services, you see that spending from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers represents the majority of our billings in the segment, supported by our strategic focus on expanding our range of products to help our SME clients run their businesses. We saw another quarter of solid growth in U.S. SME, though you can see that it was the slowest growing customer type this quarter, up 80% year-over-year. As you heard Steve talk about a bit last month at an investor conference, our SMEs have recently started to slow down spending in service categories such as digital advertising, so we continue to monitor spending trends. Moving to our U.S. large and global corporate customers, the one small customer type that has not come back to pre-pandemic spend levels, they did continue though their steady recovery this quarter with overall billings now 11% below pre-pandemic levels. And lastly, you see our highest growth in international card services as this segment is now in a steep recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments. Spending from international consumer and international SME and large corporate customers grew 23% and 32% year-over-year respectively in Q4. Across all customer types, T&E spending momentum remained particularly strong in the fourth quarter. While we also saw a nice sequential growth in the amount of goods and services spending versus last quarter, so there were a few pockets that slowed, such as the digital advertising spend in SME that I mentioned earlier. So what do all of these takeaways mean for 2023? At this point, on a dollar basis, most of our spending categories have fully recovered. So I would expect more stable growth rates this year across spending categories with the exception that year-over-year growth rates for T&E spending will likely be elevated in Q1 as we lap the impact of Omicron from the prior year. Importantly, all of the things that Steve just talked about that make up the strategy underlying our growth plan have created a foundation for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic. Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8, we saw year-over-year growth of 24% in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth. This loan growth is now exceeding our spend growth as customers steadily rebuild their balances. Given the volumes, of course, have now lapped, there is deep phase of recovery, we do expect the growth rate of our loan balances to moderate as we progress through 2023, but to remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances, which surpassed 2019 levels last quarter also continues to consistently rebuild with over 70% of year-over-year growth in the U.S. coming from our existing customers, which is about 10 percentage points more than what we saw in the years leading up to the pandemic. As you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. So they did continue to pick up this quarter as we expected, which you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, we expect delinquency and write-off rates to continue to move up over time, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023 for Card Member loans. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10 and to this year-end and because the pandemic has clearly impacted the timing of quarterly reserve build and release adjustments across the industry, I think it\u2019s helpful to look at our full year provision results. Full year 2022 provision expense was $2.2 billion, which included a $617 million reserve build, primarily driven by loan growth, the continued steady and expected increase in delinquency rates and changes in the macroeconomic outlook as the year progressed. The $2.2 billion number is of course still unusually low by historical standards relative to the size of our loan balances and card member receivables. Of the full year $617 million reserve build, we saw $492 million of it in the fourth quarter. Since earlier this year, we were still releasing a significant amount of the credit reserves we have built to capture the uncertainty of the pandemic. At this point, we no longer have any of these pandemic-driven reserves remaining on our balance sheet. Moving to reserves on Slide 11, you can see that we ended 2022 with $4 billion of reserves, representing 2.4% of our total loans in Card Member receivables. This reserve rate is about 50 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio and the strong credit performance we have seen. We view this consolidated reserve rate as more comparable to day 1 CECL than the individual loans and receivables rates. Because as we talked a bit last quarter, our charge products in many instances now have some embedded lending functionality. We expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels. Taking all of this into account, in 2023, you should expect to see provision expense move back towards more of a steady state relative to the size of our loan balances and Card Member receivables for the first time since we adopted CECL in early 2020. Given the combination of our strong loan growth and the unusually low level by historical standards of provision expense in 2022, I would expect a significant year-over-year increase in provision expense. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12, total revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 25% for the full year. This is well above our original expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategy and is part of which strengthens our confidence in our long-term aspirations. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that you see a 200 basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth and reported revenue growth for this quarter. While this is less of an impact from the strong dollar than what we saw in the prior quarter, it does remain a modest headwind. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q4 and 27% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 13, this growth is primarily driven by the momentum seen in our spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fee revenues continued to accelerate throughout this year, up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 14. In 2023, I expect net card fees to be our fastest growing revenue line. I would expect growth to moderate from the extremely high level we saw this quarter. This steady growth is powered by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investments we have made in our premium value propositions, as Steve discussed earlier, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Card members and U.S. business Platinum Card members, all reaching record highs in 2022. Moving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year in Q4 and 28% for the year on an FX-adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. The rising interest rate environment has had a fairly neutral impact on our results in \u201822 as deposit betas lagged the rapid and steep benchmark rate increases during the year. However, when you think about 2023, deposit betas are now in line with more historical levels. So I would expect the year-over-year impact from rising rates to represent more of a headwind in 2023. To sum up on revenues, we are seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum. Looking forward into 2023, we expect to see revenue growth of 15% to 17%. Now all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we have made in those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs, as you see on Slide 17, came in at 42% total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year. Based off the Q4 exit rates, combined with our continued focus on investing to innovate our products, I would expect variable customer engagement costs to approach 43% of total revenues in 2023. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion in the full year. As a reminder, our marketing dollars mostly represent the things we do to directly drive the great customer acquisition results we are seeing. As we look forward, we remain focused on driving efficiency so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues as we did for many years prior to the pandemic. As a result in 2023, we expect to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to 2022. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter and $13.7 billion for full year \u201822. In understanding our OpEx results, it\u2019s important to note the net mark-to-market impact to our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio that I mentioned earlier with reference to Q4. These gains and losses are reported in the OpEx line and totaled $302 million in losses for full year 2022, while in the prior year, we had a $767 million benefit in net gains. Even putting this aside, as Steve and I have discussed all year, our 2022 operating expenses do represent a step function increase compared to prior years as we have invested in key underpinnings to support our revenue growth and this inflation has had some impact on our expenses. Moving forward, similar to marketing, we are focused on gaining efficiencies and getting back to the low levels of growth in OpEx that we have historically seen. For 2023, we expect operating expenses to be around $14 billion and see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to the high level of revenue growth in our growth plan. Last, our effective tax rate for full year 2022 was around 22%. Our best estimate of the effective tax rate in 2023 is between 23% to 24%, absent any legislative changes. Turning next to capital, on Slide 18, we returned $4.9 billion in capital to our shareholders in 2022, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter with $639 million of common stock repurchases and $389 billion in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.3% within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 \u201823, as Steve discussed, we do expect to increase our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend decline with earnings and our 20% to 25% target payout ratio. We will continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth going forward. That then brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 19. 2022 was a strong year where we exceeded our full year guidance that we laid out in our growth plan last January for both the revenues and EPS. These results have strengthened our confidence in our 2023 guidance. First and most importantly, we expect the strategies that Steve laid out earlier to deliver continued high levels of revenue growth, leading to our revenue growth guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% and setting us up well for 2024 and beyond. As you think about the drivers of EPS growth in 2023, first, we expect to return to the low levels of growth we have historically driven in our marketing and operating expenses producing some nice leverage. Going the other driver, the two notable headwinds that should be just 2023 challenges are around the year-over-year impacts of provision and of interest rates, as I discussed earlier. Combining all of these factors together, it leads to our EPS guidance of $11 to $11.40 for 2023. There is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But as Steve discussed, our 2023 guidance factors in the blue-chip macroeconomic consensus, which is for slowing growth though not a significant recession. I\u2019d also say that our guidance is based on what we are actually seeing in terms of behavior from our customers around the globe. And of course, it reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. We feel good about the momentum we see in our business and in any environment, remain committed to running the company with a focus on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond as we get to a more steady-state macro environment. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Jeff. [Operator Instructions] And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Ryan.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So Steve, maybe just to focus on the revenue growth, so obviously, 15% to 17% is much better than the market was expecting, given macro concerns. And there is obviously been a little bit of an uptick in white collar unemployment. So could you maybe just talk high level about how you\u2019re able to put up this type of revenue growth in a somewhat weakening environment? Maybe just talk through some of the things that are idiosyncratic to Amex that Jeff just referenced, at the end of the call that maybe the market isn\u2019t appreciating that should be big drivers of revenue growth in the year ahead. Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think Jeff really hit it. I mean, what he basically said was, and this is where we what we\u2019re focused on is we can only run the business and forecast the business on what we\u2019re seeing. And what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re still seeing high consumer growth. We\u2019re seeing high consumer growth in international. We talked about some moderation in small business. Corporate spending still has not come back. Jeff talked about T&E. But I think when you think about the model, I think what \u2013 you have to get an appreciation for is we\u2019re a small segment of the overall U.S. population, and it\u2019s a premium customer base. And that premium customer base, while not immune to economic downturn, certainly, right now is spending on through. And so the other thing that we\u2019ve been doing is we\u2019re constantly tightening up the card members that we\u2019re acquiring. I mean, look, the card member base we have today is from a credit perspective, better than the card member base that we had pre-pandemic. And card members we\u2019re acquiring today are reaching a higher hurdle rate than ones we acquired just a year ago. And because of the value, there is still a good pool of customers that are out there. As far as overall white-collar unemployment, what I would say is, yes, you\u2019ve seen some headlines of individual companies that are going through layoffs. But the one thing that I would say is I think it\u2019s really important to look at where these companies were pre-pandemic. And they are probably still at employment levels that are much higher than what they were pre-pandemic. And so there is a rightsizing a little bit. But even with that rightsizing, we still have unemployment rates under 4%. And so look, we look at unemployment. But it has not, at this particular point in time, had any impact on our on our card member base. I mean, again, keeping our write-offs at 0.8 and 0.6 is sort of not sustainable and were 1.1, as Jeff said, it shows on the slides. And that will tick up a little bit over time. But that\u2019s just normal for the business. So I think what you have to really \u2013 you have to look at is this is a premium card member base that appreciates premium products and is spending. And it is a \u2013 it is a small piece of the overall U.S. economy. And we\u2019ve talked about the economy being bifurcated and it\u2019s probably no better example of what we have here. The other thing that I would say, when you think about revenue growth, unlike our competitors, we have a 3-legged revenue stool here, right? You\u2019ve got \u2013 you\u2019ve got fees that we get for merchants, you have card fees. No card fees were 25% growth in the fourth quarter. And while that\u2019s a high number, we certainly expect double-digit card fee growth to continue. And then you have, obviously, which is a smaller portion of our business. We have obviously interest revenue as well. So when we look at the card members we\u2019re acquiring, we\u2019re really looking at acquiring revenue across those three components. And the other thing I\u2019d point you to is 70% of the cards that we acquire are paying fees. So that\u2019s how we come up with 15% to 17%\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. I had a revenue question as well. Jeff, could you maybe just disaggregate the building blocks of the revenue growth. I know you mentioned a couple of things in terms of the trends on fees and NII. I\u2019m just looking at discount revenue and the year-over-year change in growth, and that sort of decelerated a little bit more than I had anticipated, I guess, does that slow down? Maybe some help there would be helpful?\nJeff Campbell: I think, Sanjay, the building blocks are pretty straightforward. And of course, as Steve just pointed out in our model, you always have to start expecting, right? That\u2019s what drives our model, that lending. And I think probably the important words that I would pick out of some of the things Steve and I have just said, for most of our spending categories, if you think about what\u2019s important in terms of dollars, we really have hit recovery point. And so as we look at the Q4 rate, I actually see those exit rates is approaching pretty stable levels for what we think given the tremendous success we\u2019re having in bringing new customers into the franchise because as you know, Sanjay, that is a key aspect of what drives our growth. I actually see those rates being fairly stable going forward. So that\u2019s what drives first really strong discount revenue growth. Our card fee growth, as Steve just mentioned, is super sustainable. I\u2019d just remind everyone that is the front-line item that grew double digits right through all the ups and downs of the pandemic. And gosh, our latest figures that Steve just gave you, 70% of our card members on fee-paying products this quarter, we have a long ways to go to keep growing net card fees. And then, look, it\u2019s the third leg of the stool. It\u2019s only 19%, 20% of our revenues, but net interest income matters. And we are still in a rebuilding mode of balance. Certainly, that process has now begun in earnest, and that\u2019s why you saw our loans grow a little faster than volumes this quarter. So I don\u2019t expect to see quite as high a rate next year as you saw in Q4. But it\u2019s still above in 2023, I would say the stable level and still above where we were pre pandemic because of that rebuilding process. So you put all that together with the comments that you\u2019ve now heard both Steve and I make, which is, look, we got to run the business based on what we see with our customers who are premium consumers, select segments of small businesses and the largest companies in the world, and that\u2019s where you get to the 15% to 17% revenue growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: So another kind of subtext on this theme. I wanted to understand a little bit about how I should be triangulating the revenue growth outlook, which is very clear with the comments around normalization of credit, should I be expecting that you\u2019re underwriting to that pre-pandemic level of was it 2.3 on the slide, with marketing spend being flat and the proprietary net acquired accounts here coming down a little bit in the quarter. So when I see all that, I\u2019m thinking that your bubble of account acquisitions is through, I suppose, and you don\u2019t need that marketing dollars to drive that incremental rev growth at the same time as you\u2019re underwriting to a group, a credit pool that\u2019s similar to pre-pandemic so we should have that NCO trajectory move back up towards pre pandemic? Or is there something that I\u2019m missing in pulling that all together? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Well, there is a lot there, but let me try and talk about marketing, and Jeff can pick up on other components. But \u2013 so look, the $5.5 billion of marketing spend was all-time record high. And the 12.5 million cards that we acquired. The fact that you saw a 300,000 card decrease sort of sequentially quarter-over-quarter is not something that we\u2019re concerned about at all. And some of the comped timing of when you do your acquisition and so forth. And so \u2013 but the key point here is that we\u2019re all looking at marketing efficiencies. And we continuously raise the bar on who we are bringing into the franchise. So we\u2019re not \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at a bubble in terms of card acquisition. We don\u2019t project card acquisition. We provide the card acquisition numbers, but for us, and probably we need to do a better job going forward from a metrics perspective, but we really look at revenue. I mean we look at the cards that we acquire in terms of how much revenue we can acquire. It\u2019s the same thing with billings. I mean, not all billings are created equal. I mean there is billings that you have that don\u2019t have a lot of value to it within the industry, we look at profitable billings, we look at card fees and we look at that, as Jeff said, interest income. So I wouldn\u2019t take away from this that we were at an inflection point or a bubble or anything like that. I think the $5.5 billion is a tremendous amount of money to go out there and acquire with, and we\u2019re pushing the organization to even be more efficient and more effective with that money. So we are looking at the same kind of acquisition levels that we\u2019ve had in the past with higher underwriting standards as well. As far as operating expenses go, and as you start to think about that, we had a big step-up in operating expenses as we had tremendous growth. And having had a lot of experience running the components of this organization from both a technology perspective and an operating perspective, travel and what have you, as you see those volume increases, you need to manage and to get to that next level of scale. And we believe that we have gotten to that next level of scale, and we will get back to normal operating expense growth. And the other part of it just like everybody else look rates increased there was some inflationary pressure within there, but make no mistake about it, there was \u2013 we had to get to another scale. When you have 25% revenue growth, we have 25% billings growth. When you have travel bookings that at all-time highs and continuing to increase quarter-over-quarter, you have to put in place not only the digital capabilities, but the people to make sure that you can handle all that. So from an expense perspective, the reason we\u2019re able to say that we think marketing will be where it is and operating expenses will not grow at the same level that they will because we believe we\u2019ve gotten to that scale component that we now believe that we can grow revenues 15% to 17% get into a 10% growth mode 2020 \u2013 plus 10% plus growth mode 2024 and beyond with that scale until the point in time. And I don\u2019t know when that is where we have to have another scale jump. But what you saw from a growth perspective, last year was all about the scale. So Jeff, do you want to talk about credit or anything else or...\nJeff Campbell: No.\nSteve Squeri: So that\u2019s how I would think about that in terms of going below sort of the components of revenue and how expenses relate to that revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thank you. Sorry if I missed this, but can you talk about how sensitive your revenue guidance is to the macro, kind of what gets you to the high and low end of the range you provided? And are you using at all the same assumptions around GDP and unemployment that you used to kind of set the reserve levels?\nJeff Campbell: Mark, one of the interesting things that I think surprises people is we have looked historically every way you could imagine, trying to find really direct correlations between GDP growth and for that matter between movements in the markets that affect people\u2019s financial wealth. And the, I think, surprising things to many people is we can\u2019t find any direct correlation between those two things. So when you look at our 15% to 17% guidance, it\u2019s really \u2013 I go back to what Steve and I have both now said a couple of times, driven by \u2013 our best indicator is what we see with our customers around the globe and how they are behaving. And we certainly are aware of and thinking about various macroeconomic forecasts but you start with what behaviors are we actually seeing. And I\u2019d also remind everyone that the U.S. remains by far our largest market. The U.S. economy shrank in the first two quarters of 2022, and we just posted revenue growth for the full year, 25%. So when I think about the 15% to 17% range, it\u2019s really not a 15% is a weaker economy, 17%. Frankly, it\u2019s \u2013 I wish we were more precise about forecasting, but it\u2019s just a little bit of forecast error, I would say, based on the trends we\u2019ve seen and the macroeconomic consensus, which is absolutely. The economy is supposed to slow when you look at that consensus, and that\u2019s factored in here as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. I think you said 70% of existing loan lending growth came from existing members. Is there a similar metric you can share on the spending side? Just trying to understand as things normalize and we get into more of a normal cadence how maybe help us project a little bit on spending growth, how that can translate as we look at your last few quarters of strong acquisitions? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, so what I\u2019d say is that when you look at lending, I\u2019m going to go back to that 70% number. And I do think it\u2019s an important one to think about the implications. I think occasionally people look at our loan growth and say, is that all the new customers you\u2019re acquiring and what do you know about them? And so we actually draw a lot of comfort from the fact that you have 70% of that loan growth coming from just our existing customers that we know well, we have history with really just rebuilding more towards historical levels. If you think about spending, in our model, we talk a lot about the fact that we have, I think, by the standards of most industries, remarkably high retention rates in the high 90% range. And that\u2019s a real key strength of our model. Once we get someone into the franchise, they intend to stay. That group, depending on the economy is growing organically a little bit. When you think about adding our new customers that is a key engine at any point in time of adding another normal environment. And it varies over time, but I might anchor around an 8% to 10% kind of number. So it\u2019s a mixture of super low retention what we are doing to spur more spending by our existing customers and that steady flow of new customers. And so one of the things again, that Steve and I have both just talked about, because I think people seem a little surprised to you by the 15% to 17% is a key driver, why we are comfortable with that is our tremendous success over the last year, and in the first weeks of 2023 and bringing great new customers into the franchise.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. And the other thing that I would say is and I said this in my remarks, this virtuous cycle that we talk about, the more card members we bring in, the more merchant and partner offers that we can get. And so the engagement \u2013 the increased engagement from existing cardholders is a really important driver of growth. So that \u2013 the membership model is we just don\u2019t bring our card members in and sort of watch them hope they grow. We bring our card members in and we want to work with them to grow. We do that from a small business perspective with our account development teams, making sure that they are taking advantage of all the benefits of the card, making sure that they are spending in categories that they can spend in, maximizing rewards and so forth. And we do that with our card base from an offer perspective through Amex offers through other direct offers from partners embedded offers within the model. And so a lot of our engagement not only from a customer service perspective is to making sure that our card members are taking advantage of all the aspects of the card that are out there. And so we really look to grow same-store sales, right. I mean so from existing card members, we are constantly looking to grow that share of their wallet. And again, that gets easier as the cycle gets bigger because more and more merchants want to reach more and more of our card members.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brian Foran of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nBrian Foran: Hi, obviously, a very positive outlook. I don\u2019t want to sound negative, but I think what we are all kind of dealing with is investors being like this is great? I will take it, but help me think about what are the risks? Where could it go wrong? So, maybe one question and one follow-up along the same theme, Jeff, when you were talking about the macro sensitivity, one question I hear sometimes is the note that the aspirational 2024 and beyond is a steady-state macro. And I get the investor question like, where is the dividing line? Like what would non-steady state macro look like where that guidance would then or aspiration within not apply? So, maybe you could touch on that, like what are the bounds in your mind for a steady-state macro?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think Brian, I would start with two comments. First, when you think about our long-term aspirations, we don\u2019t actually worry about recessions at all because the reality is, at some point, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s six months from now or 6 years, there will be a recession. And after that recession, there will be a recovery. And it doesn\u2019t change our view of we should be able to steadily grow this company in excess of 10%. Now, when there is a recession where you see a very significant shrinkage in GDP. So, not like the first half of last year where maybe the U.S. GDP went down 0.5 point or something. But where you suddenly see a quarter or two quarters where you have a pandemic like or great financial crisis like large percentage declines in GDP and you see huge spikes in unemployment. If you go back to one of the appendix slides, you will see that our CECL credit reserve accounting assumes a baseline and also builds in a downside scenario. In that downside scenario, you have 8% unemployment by the third quarter of 2023. Well, if there is 8% unemployment by the third quarter of 2023, we are going to have a few quarters where we are probably below our longer term aspirations. But is that kind of large shock that\u2019s going to knock us off for a few quarters, but I really want to keep coming back to and I suspect, Steve, you might reinforce this, but it doesn\u2019t change our long-term aspirations or how we are going to run the company.\nSteve Squeri: No. And I think just go back to the pandemic. So, look, we pulled back on acquiring card members because I don\u2019t think anybody had any line of sight. I mean that the pandemic was worse than the financial crisis from a credit underwriting perspective. You never say never, but that\u2019s sort of like the 100-year flood, right. And so my perspective is we will still acquire in that kind of scenario. And remember, everything we acquired today, we acquired through the cycle, but what we would do is move the credit criteria even further up. But what we would do again is we would engage with our card members. I think one of the most successful things that we did during the pandemic was retaining card hold, retaining those cardholders, whether it was through financial relief programs that got them through the hump for a couple of months or six months, whatever it was, or engaging them to spend in other areas and to stick with us. So, the reality is, is that if we were running this business quarter-to-quarter, which we don\u2019t, you would pull back. But the reality is, as Jeff said, after every recession there is a recovery. And the last thing you want to do is retrench in such a way that you are not going to be able to take advantage of the recovery. And that retrenchment, looks \u2013 it looks like layoffs that don\u2019t make sense and pulling back on marketing and trying to hit an EPS number for a quarter or for a year that is irrelevant. What\u2019s relevant is for a 172-year-old company to continue to grow over the medium and long-term. And the way you do that is you invest judiciously and you invest smartly. And in times when things are bad, you invest in your infrastructure, you invest in your people because you are going to need great people through when a recession is over, and your infrastructure is going to need to do that. And where companies make mistakes is let go of great people, and also do not invest in those things, they are going to need six months to nine months from now when the recession is over. So, yes, we may have a moment in time, as Jeff said, it could be six months, it could be 6 years, but there will be a time when we don\u2019t make that. And \u2013 but there will be a time where we exceed that. And that\u2019s why we say our long-term aspiration is for 10%-plus growth in revenue, and we feel we are on a way to that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my question. Look, when we look at Slide 5, it\u2019s really interesting in terms of the contribution and the significant growth from millennials and Gen Z. You guys have been really successful there. And we have seen that progress over time. I am curious, given that the millennial Gen Z growth in the last year was basically 5x, 4x to 5x other cohorts and the significant loan growth. If we looked at this distribution by age cohort, not for build business, but by portfolio in terms of borrowings, what the distribution would look like with millennials over-index versus the peers?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the short answer, Rick, is no. When you think about the behavior of the millennials and Gen Zs, there are a few distinguishing features, and we have talked about these. They tend to be more digitally and engaged. They tend to be more engaged with the overall value proposition, which we actually see as a good thing. Because of that, they often will engage more quickly when they get the new product. But I would also remind you of the other stat we have talked about this morning, which is 70% of our growth in loans right now is coming from existing customer facilities. We add a lot of these millennials there. That segment is still not adding as much to the loan growth because of the rebuild imbalances by your existing customers. So, while the behaviors of the younger card members are on average, similar to the older card members when you think about borrowing, just sort of the math here because you have got this rebuilding effect would say that they are not driving that bigger portion of our loan growth.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. And we tend to get a higher share of their wallet, but they have lower \u2013 they do have lower spending. And the great part about millennials and Gen Zs is that they are \u2013 and depending on where you are in millennial. I mean some millennials are 40 now. So, I mean, they are in a different thing. But the reality is the lifetime value of these cardholders is going to be significantly more than the lifetime value of acquiring a boomer or acquiring a Gen Xer right now. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s very attractive as well. And if you look, again, Rick, on Page 5, you will see that, look, it\u2019s 30% of the business growth. On the other hand, the boomer growth is only 6%. And some of those have been leery to go back travel still. So, we would also expect that to go up.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey. Good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Hey Dominick.\nDominick Gabriele: Great results. Good morning. I just want to change the topic a little bit. I just wanted your updated thoughts if you could just remind everybody about your ability to make account-by-account purchase limit authorization decisions given many of the accounts don\u2019t actually have stated line sizes on the charge cards. So, I am just really wondering about severity of loss in the downturn versus the frequency is more based on unemployment, but your ability to really hone in on limiting the severity of loss given your underwriting techniques. Thanks so much guys.\nSteve Squeri: I mean I think you just reminded us. The reality is, it\u2019s a couple of things, right. Number one, we constantly go through and look at contingent liability that\u2019s not being utilized. And so if we have somebody that has X for Align and they are only using 25% of X, we may not keep X there that long. We don\u2019t want to be a lender of last resort, right. That\u2019s number one. Number two, we also are \u2013 for new card members, we are raising those cycles, but raising the limit, the hurdle rate that we acquire card members. But we underwrite every transaction. We make a credit decision not based on the line because most of our card members do not have a line. I mean obviously, traditional lending cards have line. But other than that, we are underwriting every single transaction. So, we are not letting somebody just run it up because they have run it up in the past. And we are not letting somebody run up to a limit and have that write-off. One of the advantages of our model, and I am not going to get into all the variables underneath for a couple of reasons. Number one, we don\u2019t have time. And number two, it\u2019s very complicated. And number three, I probably don\u2019t fully all understand the whole thing either. But it\u2019s \u2013 an advantage of this model is that every single transaction is adjudicated on its own merits. It\u2019s not adjudicated based on an open to buy. And that is very important. It also \u2013 but that\u2019s from a credit perspective, that\u2019s a really reassuring thing. But from a spending perspective, it also enables why you read some of these stories of, hey, I just bought a painting for $75 million. There is nobody that has a $75 million line, right. Now, those are very difficult underwriting decisions and not for the faint of heart, but it does show that we make those same kind of decisions on a $200 purchase, on a $400 purchase. Every single transaction that comes through this system is adjudicated on its own merits, not on sort of some open to buy, and that gives us great comfort in terms of not having somebody just run something up and then have something written off.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. The only thing I would add, I think that is a unique capability we have honed over many decades since we first started the charge card product. The other advantage of the charge card product, I would say, Dominick, is it does give us this population who is supposed to pay us in full every 30 days, which actually is almost like an early warning system from an overall risk management perspective of when there are problems that pop up in various parts of the world or various segments or various customer types. And we think that\u2019s actually helpful to our overall results, and it\u2019s the part of the many things that drives us historically and today to have by far, best-of-class credit metrics.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Sorry to go back to the revenue guide. But Jeff, and I appreciate the 25% revenue growth for the full year, but the quarter was 17%. And between you and Steve, you both said that there was going to be a slowdown, it\u2019s still strong, obviously, but a slowdown in card fee revenue growth and with the comments about margin, probably net interest income. So, I guess is there a part of the revenue base that you think is accelerating in \u201823?\nJeff Campbell: Well, so, two comments. I think it\u2019s a good call out, Moshe. The first comment is as you think about 2021, of course, the base year here, you saw things progressively pick up as you went through the year. So, that\u2019s why each quarter our volumes on a year-over-year basis has slowed a little bit. But we also have pointed out that I think you are sort of through that recovery period now. So, I think what you see in Q4 in our view, is very typical of what you are going to get. Now, the one exception that we do think will accelerate is the net interest income piece, because you do have customers continuing to rebuild balances. So, net card fees probably moderates a little bit. Net interest income probably accelerates a little bit. But your discount revenue should be pretty consistent with what you would have seen in this quarter. And that\u2019s really the model that leads you from Q4 to what we expect for 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you. And maybe some topics that haven\u2019t been touched on yet. And Steve, you called out investment in services and adjacencies, I would say and also, the international piece, expanding your merchant acceptance there. So, just any call-outs on adjacencies, the B2B payments and your \u2013 how that contributes to your long-term strategy. And then international, I seem to recall Japan being an important market for, you saw some good growth internationally, Japan reopened, China is reopening. Is there acceleration potential in international in 2023?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, let me hit a couple of these topics and hopefully, I remember the mall that you went through. But look, I think international, we have seen which is really good and just look at the slides, you have seen really good growth from not only a consumer perspective, which is over 20%, but international SME and large corporations are growing at 32%. So \u2013 and remember, pre-pandemic, those are the fastest-growing parts of our business. So, we expect that to continue to grow, which obviously Japan is part of it and one of our top markets. From an acceptance perspective, we continue to grow acceptance internationally. We are really happy with the coverage gains that we have had, and we will continue to focus on that. We have talked about focusing on priority cities. We focused on all the categories, e-commerce, restaurants and lodging and tourist attractions, airlines, hotel and so forth to get those up. But again, with that we are getting 23% and 32% billings growth and our coverage is not where we want it to be yet, and we will continue to invest in that coverage. Look, as far as B2B goes, B2B continues to be a good story for us, but it\u2019s just a small part \u2013 it\u2019s a smaller part of the business. And we continue to invest in capabilities and we will continue to focus on B2B, but that will add not only to commercial spending, but that will also add to small business spending as well. And remember, 80% of the small business spending that we have is in the category of B2B spending. And so we will continue to hunt for that and try and automate more and more of those billings, and it makes it easy to get on the card.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi Steve. Just curious if you have seen anything that sort of raised your concern level around competition in U.S. consumer or small business. I mean it seems to us like you might be pulling away a little bit from competitors. I am not sure if your metrics suggest that or not?\nSteve Squeri: Well, I mean I don\u2019t \u2013 we continually look to raise the bar. And I think that there is a lot of great competitors out there. We have got JPMorgan and Bank of America and Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank and Capital One. And everybody is \u2013 they are all strong. And they \u2013 I mean they all had pretty strong results from a growth perspective. But as I said in my remarks, the more value we continue to add, the more we get our flywheel working, the harder it is to catch up. And we are not resting on our laurels. And that\u2019s why we continue to invest. We continue to invest in value propositions. We continue to invest in capabilities. We continue to invest in service. And so are we increasing the distance between us and our competitors, I don\u2019t know how you measure that, but I think we \u2013 our goal is to constantly make it hard for them to catch up. And our goal is to make sure that we are trying to be one step, two steps or three steps ahead of them. And it\u2019s flattering, actually that they are coming after the segments that we are in. And \u2013 but competition is there, and it is fierce. And for us, competition is just not U.S. consumer. It\u2019s a small business. It\u2019s corporate. It\u2019s in international. And so we are fighting a lot of battles here in terms of defending our territory, but I think the team is doing a really, really good job. But we are never going to rest. And if in fact they stopped, we still keep going. So, it is really important. I think it\u2019s one of the things that we decided a number of years ago that we would constantly refresh our products on a very regular basis and add value on an interim basis, which you have seen with our Platinum Card and our other products. And I think that\u2019s really helped us out quite a bit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question about international. The 26% of business growth in international really caught my eye because that figure is more than 2x of what Visa and Mastercard\u2019s international credit growth was in the fourth quarter. And so I was hoping to just dig in a little bit, so into what \u2013 looking at your international business is driving that and how sustainable it is? It looks like it\u2019s mostly driven by spending per card. The card growth isn\u2019t unusually high. So, is there a \u2013 I am trying to understand, is this a significant share gain going on? Is this acceptance that you are driving? Is this something unique about the geographic composition of the customer base. Can you just dig into that a little bit? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, Lisa, I think it\u2019s \u2013 look, pre-pandemic, we are pretty close to 20% anyway from an international perspective. And look, it\u2019s a smaller base than Visa, Mastercard. And it\u2019s a really high premium customer segment. And it\u2019s a segment that travels \u2013 it\u2019s a card base that travels quite a bit. So, pre-pandemic, we were growing in that 20% range. And that growth was due to a real focus on value proposition and a focus on merchant acceptance. I think what you are seeing right now, which is 26% growth, which is slightly outsized growth is still a recovery from the pandemic, right. I mean if you think about it, this 26% growth quarter-over-quarter, you still had a lot of lockdowns. People were not traveling last year at this time in international and so. Look, we are \u2013 our goal is to \u2013 our hope is to continue to grow this business as it was pre-pandemic at around that 20% level. But from my perspective, there is really nothing unusual here. We are sticking to our strategy, enhancing the value, continuing to add merchant acceptance and continuing to invest in this segment \u2013 these two segments of small business and international consumer card, which were fast-growing pre-pandemic, so nothing really unusual. And it probably normalizes a little bit as the year goes because people were getting out there and traveling and we got into the second and third quarters.\nKerri Bernstein: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

Please go ahead.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Darryl, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release this morning, we had another strong quarter. Revenues grew 27% on an FX-adjusted basis and earnings per share was $2.47, up 9% over last year. Our investments to drive customer engagement, acquisitions, and retention once again generated great results and our credit quality remained strong. Card Member spending remained at near record levels in the quarter. Billed business was up 24% on an FX-adjusted basis over the record growth we delivered a year earlier, led by the continued strength in Goods & Services spending and the ongoing strong rebound in Travel & Entertainment. As we said earlier this year, we expected the recovery in travel spending to be a tailwind for us, but the strength of the rebound has exceeded our expectations throughout the year. In the quarter, total T&E spending was up 57% from a year earlier on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the continued strong demand from consumers and small business customers. Particularly noteworthy is the strength we're seeing in T&E spending in our international markets, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time this quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Business travel also continued to recover and overall activity remained strong through September. Importantly, we're seeing increased customer engagement with a wide range of travel and dining benefits and services we offer as part of our membership model. For example, bookings to our consumer travel business reached their highest level since before the pandemic in the third quarter. And in dining, our resi reservation platform continues to see strong growth. Since we acquired the platform in 2019, resi users have tripled to reach $35 million, and we quadrupled a number of restaurants available around the world on resi. Goods & Services spending grew 16% year-over-year. The continued growth in Goods & Services is supported by the structural shift to online commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic and has been sustained since then, the new online and mobile oriented benefits we added to our value propositions. These benefits are particularly attractive to our millennial and Gen Z customer base, which is our fastest-growing customer cohort. The investments we've made in our value propositions are also continuing to drive momentum in new card acquisitions. We added 3.3 million new proprietary cards during the quarter, our highest quarterly level of acquisitions since the pandemic began. And we continue to see strong uptake of our premium fee-based products with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold cards as well as U.S. Business Platinum cards reaching record quarterly highs. Millennial and Gen Z customers are powering this growth comprising more than 60% of our proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter. As we sit here today, we see no changes in the spending behaviors of our customers, and our credit metrics continue to be strong with delinquencies and write-offs remaining at low levels even as loan balances are steadily rebuilding. Of course, we are mindful of the mixed signals in the broader economy. As always, we have plans in place to pivot should the operating environment change dramatically. And we've been taking thoughtful risk management actions to be prepared in the event of a downturn. But as I've emphasized many times before, we run the company for the long-term and make through the cycle investment decisions. Our strong third quarter results show that our strategy investing in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage continues to pay off, and our performance is consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. Looking ahead, we continue to see many great growth opportunities, and we will continue to take actions to best position our business for the long-term. As you will recall, our international businesses were among the fastest growing prior to the pandemic. As more countries relax their cross-border travel policies and life returns to normal, we see tremendous opportunities for growth in key regions despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. To that point, we made an organizational change a few months ago to help seize on these opportunities. We brought together our international consumer, small business and large corporate management teams under one leader, which will increase our speed, agility, scale and efficiency in our operations outside the U.S. As a result, you'll see this quarter, we've introduced a new International Card Services reporting segment. Looking ahead, we remain confident that the successful execution of our strategy, driven by our outstanding leadership team and the talented colleagues throughout the company, positions us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. Based on our performance through the third quarter, we also remain confident in our full year revenue growth guidance of 23% to 25%, and we expect to be above our original full year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide a detailed overview of our Q3 results.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Most importantly, our third quarter revenues were $13.6 billion, reaching a record high in the second quarter in a row, up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Now I would point out that we continue to see a much stronger U.S. dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate. So you do see a 300 basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth of 27% and our reported revenue growth of 24%, as we absorb some significant foreign exchange headwinds. Of course, the overall impact on our earnings still a headwind is less significant, because we do have some offsetting positive impacts on the expense side. Our revenue performance in the third quarter drove reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.47, representing EPS growth of 9% year-over-year, a great result considering the sizable credit reserve releases we had in the third quarter last year. Because of these prior year reserve releases, we have also included pretax provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pretax provision income was $3.2 billion, up 43% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings. Before getting into a more detailed look at results, let me spend just a minute briefly explaining how we've evolved our financial reporting for the organizational changes that Steve discussed earlier. You will see in the disclosures of the company earnings release that beginning this quarter, we have moved from three to four reportable operating segments. We first took global consumer services and split the U.S. into its own segment, creating U.S. Consumer Services. We then combine the international consumer business with the international portion of small and medium-sized enterprises and large corporate creating the new International Card Services segment. Commercial Services, that includes U.S. SME, U.S. large corporate and select global corporate clients. And lastly, our Global Merchant and Network Services segment remains largely unchanged, and as always, includes our global payments network and network partnerships. You will see in the appendix of our disclosures that we have recast prior periods to conform to these new operating segments. The new segments will also be reflected in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Now let's get into our results, beginning with overall volumes. Looking at Slides 3 and 4, you can see the continued strength in our Card Member spending behavior that Steve noted earlier. Total network volumes and build business were each up year-over-year at 23% and 24%, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis in the third quarter. If you were to compare to 2019, third quarter build business grew 30%, accelerating above last quarter's growth rate of 28% relative to 2019. And importantly, despite the uncertainties in the current economic environment, our spending trends with performance relative to 2019 strengthened as we went through the quarter. We are really pleased with this growth. And the fact you see strong growth across all customer types and geographies, driven by both sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued T&E momentum. On Slides 5 through 8, we've given you a variety of views of this strong growth across our US consumer services, commercial services and international card services segments, and the various customer types within each. Starting with our largest segment, billings from our US consumer customers grew at 22% in the third quarter, reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium US consumers. Millennial and Gen Z customers, again, drove our highest bill business growth within this segment, with their spending growing 39% year-over-year this quarter. Turning to Commercial Services. You see that spending from our US SME customers represents the majority of our billings in this segment and that spending from these customers continued its strong growth, up 17% in the third quarter. Our US large and global corporate customers, though a smaller part of billings in the segment, remain an important foundation for the entire company. And these customers continued their steady travel recovery this quarter, though overall billings are still 13% below pre-pandemic levels. We do continue to expect though that this group will fully recover over time. And lastly, international consumer and international SME large corporate customers within the new International Card Services segment were amongst our fastest-growing pre-pandemic, as Steve said, and are now in a steep recovery mode. You can see our high levels of growth in Q3 at 34% and 43% year-over-year, respectively. And if you were also to look at international consumer growth by age cohort, you would see, similar to the US, that the highest growth levels are from our millennial and Gen Z customers, who make up an even larger portion of overall billings than they do in the US. One other note on overall billings. The majority of our high level of growth this quarter was again driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network, with some modest impact from inflation. Overall then, we are pleased with the momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term aspirations. Now moving to loan balances. On Slide 9, we saw year-over-year growth accelerate to 31% in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarter-over-quarter, surpassing 2019 levels in the third quarter as customers steadily rebuild balances. As you then turn to credit and provisions, on Slides 10 through 12, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance. Write-off rates for Card Member loans remain well below pre-pandemic levels, flat to where they have been for the last three quarters, as you can see on Slide 10. As expected, you do now see that delinquency rates for loans have started to modestly pick up, but also remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 11. As you know, there are two components to our provision expense: our actual write-off performance in the quarter, which, as we just discussed, remain strong; and second, changes in our credit reserves, where there are a few key drivers. Our loan balances, especially our revolving loan balances grew strongly quarter-over-quarter and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our models, which was informed by third-party macroeconomic forecast as well as the latest Fed outlook, was slightly worse this quarter relative to last quarter. The combination of our strong loan growth and the updated macroeconomic assumptions resulted in a $387 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with low net write-offs, drove $778 million of provision expense for the third quarter. As you see on Slide 12, we ended the third quarter with $3.5 billion of reserves, with reserves for loans representing 3.2% of our balances. I would point out even with this quarter's reserve build, this remains well \u2013 the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, driven by our improved portfolio quality today compared to that prior time period. Going forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet and where we ended this quarter given our expected loan growth, the overall level of reserve adjustments will again be influenced by how the macroeconomic evolves in the fourth quarter. Moving next to revenue on Slide 13. Total revenues were up 24% year-over-year in the third quarter or 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up 39% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was largely driven by a recovery in travel-related revenues. Our loan revenue line, discount revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q3 on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 14, driven by both our sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and the continued momentum in T&E spending that you saw in our spending trends. Net card fee revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth continuing to accelerate, as you can see on Slide 15, largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products through the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter, we acquired 3.3 million new cards with acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold Card members and US business Platinum Card members, all reaching record highs in the quarter and now each more than two times higher than pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating the great demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products. Moving on to Slide 16, you can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. While generally speaking, a rising rate environment would be a modest headwind for us due to our sizable non-interest-bearing charge balances. An actual fact, it has been fairly neutral in terms of impact for us year-to-date. Over time, though, I would expect rising rates to represent a modest headwind. To sum up on revenues, we're seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum. When looking at Slide 17, I would point out that we have now seen six consecutive quarters of revenue growth above 24% on an FX adjusted basis as we are now showing strong growth even on top of the strong recovery-led growth in the prior year quarter. I would also point out that we have a couple of hundred basis points of difference when looking at revenue growth on an FX-adjusted basis versus our reported results. So, while we are leaving our full year reported revenue guidance at 23% to 25% for 2022, I would expect to be above that growth rate range on an FX-adjusted basis. Now, all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology, and coverage and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 18. Starting with variable customer engagement costs, these costs, as you see on Slide 18, came in at 41% total revenues for the third quarter roughly in line with what I still expect variable customer engagement costs to run for the full year at around 42% total revenues. On the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the third quarter, on track with our expectation to spend over $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong demand of card acquisitions, especially premium card acquisitions as we showed on Slide 15. And more importantly, we feel good about the spend, credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into American Express membership, which continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the bottom of Slide 18 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.3 billion in the third quarter, essentially flat to last quarter. As Steve and I have both discussed all year, these results reflect the impact inflation has had on our operating expenses, in addition to our investments in other key growth underpinnings to support our tremendous revenue growth. You can see, based off our third quarter results that we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $13 billion for the full year. And looking at the year-over-year OpEx growth of 22% this quarter, it is also important to note that we see an impact from the prior year, including a sizable benefit from net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio, while this year we saw a modest impairment charge. More generally, we continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage moving forward, and we'd expect to have far less growth in OpEx than revenues in our ambitious growth plan. Turning next to capital on Slide 19. We returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter, including common stock repurchases of $600 million and $391 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the third quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet growth. That then brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on Slide 20. With each quarter of this year, we have demonstrated consistent progress against our 2022 guidance and our long-term growth aspirations of delivering sustainable high levels of revenue and EPS growth. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our reported revenue growth guidance of 23% to 25%. Although I would point out, as I said earlier, that I would expect our FX adjusted revenue growth to be above that range. And we now expect to be above our original EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65. And uncertainty in the level of our final EPS for the year remains the possible impact on credit reserves and how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter, while I expect our actual credit performance and metrics to remain healthy. It's harder to predict exactly how the macroeconomic outlook might evolve. In addition, we are working towards our 2023 plan and expect revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets, which should create a platform for producing strong EPS growth. Of course, we'll have to see how the economic environment evolves versus where we are today. In any environment, though, we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Ryan.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So maybe just start on the top line, Steve. Solid results, once again, although clearly, as you and Jeff articulated, FX was a headwind in the quarter. And I know you mentioned you're not seeing any changes. Jeff mentioned the strength over the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing from a spend perspective, maybe relative to what you saw 90 days ago? Any changes under the surface? And then, maybe just flesh out a little bit further your confidence in the ability to generate mid-teens top and bottom line growth into 2023? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: We're confident. Look, the spending speaks for itself. I mean, just look at some of these numbers. You've got goods and services up 16%. Our U.S. consumer is up 22%. Millennial spending is up 39%. Our T&E spending is up 57%. International spending is 37%. We haven't seen any change. And you can look at this quarter-over-quarter. And the reality is that, last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending, and this is like, I don't know, $1 billion behind or something like that. But if you look at year-over-year growth, we're not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all. And look, that's not to say that things may not change, but I can only look at what I'm seeing right now. And if I look from a forward perspective, the question that we get is, what about T&E, can T&E spending hold so forth and so on? And look, I think you heard Ed Bastian last week, and he talked about not only what's been going on at Delta, but what they see going on through the holiday season. I think you've heard Chris Nassetta as well say the same kinds of things and what's happening with Hilton, and -- the of our biggest partners. And so, when we look at our consumer travel booking, we see higher bookings than we've seen in a long, long time. I mean that goes pre-pandemic. So if I look three out, because the next question that people ask is, what does the holiday season look like? Well, the holiday season, from a travel perspective, looks really, really strong, because people are booking three months out. And if you're going to be traveling, you're probably going to be going to restaurants. And if you're traveling in some place, you're probably bringing presents with you as well. So we don't see anything really changing over the next three months. And as we go into next year, we still feel really good about what our growth plan is. And the only thing I would say is, because I think I need to say this, is that if things change, we will be prepared to pivot. And I think people saw that during the pandemic. We've got our recession playbook, you have a credit cycle playbook, and we'll pull that playbook lever if we need to pull it. But to pull it at this particular point in time, does it make any sense. We're seeing strong growth and we're seeing strong credit results overall. So right now, nothing new. And the way I would headline this is that, this quarter looks like the first quarter, which looked like the second quarter, and it's the third quarter. It's another strong quarter for us. And the only thing that I would say is, I mean, when you look at our model, I think not only this quarter but this year, it really shows the strength of our differentiated business model. We have a different model than other people out there in the market. And I think that's coming through in our statistics. Year-over-year earnings growth and the top line revenue growth is not something you're used to seeing from us, unless you've been looking at the last six quarters.\nJeff Campbell: And Ryan, let me just add maybe a few other comments to try to dimension when Steve and I used a term like, well, we know how to pivot if we need to. I would remind everyone that GDP in the U.S. shrank in the first two quarters of this year, and we've been putting up revenue growth in the 24% to 30% range, steadily right through that. I'd remind you that I talked about our credit reserve is influenced by macroeconomic forecast. And so you can go look at what the Fed said in September. You can go look at what Moody's is saying. And they are predicting modest upticks in unemployment. And that's contemplated in everything Steve and I have said and in the guidance that we've provided. If you look at October, October is just a continuation of all that Steve just talked about thus far. So we feel good about the guidance we've given. We are acknowledging the environment we're in. But I don't want people to overplay our reaction to the fact that growth has been pretty slow in the U.S. because with our differentiated business model, as Steve just pointed out, performing very strongly in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Sanjay.\nSanjay Sakhrani: I guess I want to follow-up on that question. Steve, you talked about the recession playbook. Maybe we could just talk about your comments about operating the business for the long-term. And if we were to see a slowdown, how we should think about managing expenses. Marketing has been boosted quite a bit. You wouldn't want to grow as fast as you are right now in the backdrop. So maybe you can just talk about the flex there, how we should think about the aspirational targets in the backdrop of a recession or a mild one even. And then, Jeff, could you just hit the reserve rate? I know people tend to think about that reserve rate as a result -- as it relates to CECL day 1. Do you see yourself getting back to that level, given how low losses are right now? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: So, if you think about operating sort of in a recession operating in the playbook, I think the first thing you have to realize is that when you look at sort of credit and you look at how you acquire customers and how you underwrite customers, those are things that we do on an ongoing basis, right? And so we've been -- we make adjustments daily, weekly. I mean the models are constantly being updated and changing, and our return thresholds are changing. And so as we say, we manage through the cycle. When we look Card Members, we manage that so that coming through that, there is profitability, okay? And so we will continue to do that. And I'll point you back to the pandemic and what we did during the pandemic because I think that's a really good -- it's a really good model for us. So, what did we do? Well, we pulled back on your Card Member acquisition because, number one, we didn't have enough transparency at that particular point in time. And number two, maybe we weren't feeling good about sort of the Card Members that we could acquire at that point. But we never shut it down. We still acquired Card Members. So, you would see that. The only thing I would point out is we've been trending from a marketing perspective to spend well in excess of $5 billion. If you go back pre-pandemic, that number was between $3.5 billion and $3.9 billion. And so it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of delevering our marketing expenditure.  The other thing you have to realize is that a lot of our cost of Card Member services are variable in terms of spending. And so they -- and rewards as well go up and they go down as spending increases. And so I have a lot of confidence in our ability to flex our marketing numbers down. I have tremendous confidence in our ability to flex our operating expenses because operating expenses in a lot of ways go along with a lot of our volumes. So, -- and we've proven we can do that. And I think our underwriting, you would continue to tighten that up, but that's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. That's not something that you sort of just sort of end up when you get into it, you're tightening that up as you go along and as you see at any signals. And then the last thing I would say is you get into credit and collections and your ability to help our card members in a thoughtful way and your ability to collect money. And I think that a lot of the programs that we introduced during the pandemic with programs that we would be taking off the playbook. And the last point I would say is our card base is not representative of the US economy. We -- when you look at the share of card that we have in this marketplace and a number of card members, it's obviously well below double-digits. And they're not necessarily representative of what's going on in the broader economy. And the last point that I would make is a lot of people trying to equate what's going on with the stock market and going on in spending. There is no correlation in our history of that. The thing that you do worry about is unemployment and in particular, white collar unemployment. And so as we think about professionals that could potentially be laid off, that's something that you look at. But again, our models take all that into account. And we've been through this -- we've been through that kind of stuff before, and I think we're very well prepared for it.\nJeff Campbell: Before I get to credit reserve, Sanjay, I can't resist just adding though. You said, well, what would you do in a mild recession. I don't want to get into the cool debate here about semantics, but some could argue that from a growth perspective. We're in a mild recession and we just grew revenues 27% and to turn it to our credit reserves. Our credit reserve adjustments do include the latest economic forecast, which has unemployment ticking up a little bit next year, and that's included in all of our forward-looking comments. As you point out and maybe to help everyone, Sanjay, I think it's on Slide 12 in our deck today. Our day one credit reserve percentages of total loans were 4.6%. This quarter, they were all the way down at 3.2%. I will point out that if you look across the industry that is by far the lowest percentage. It's also the lowest percentage relative to day one. There's differential timing that all the different financial institutions have had over the last couple of years just due to the vagaries of the way the accounting works here. But as you sit here today, our reserve balance both on an absolute basis and relative to that day one basis is below the industry. And that makes sense, Sanjay, because we have, by far, the most premium book in the industry. We have, by far, the strongest credit metrics. And relative to pre-pandemic in that day one number, our credit profile is stronger today. All the talk you hear from Steve and I and Doug and others about our record success bringing more premium consumers into the franchise over the last couple of years has an impact on credit profile as well. So all else being equal, you would not expect our reserve percentage of loans to get back to where it was day one CECL because the average credit profile is stronger than it was day one CECL.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMark DeVries: Thanks. Could you discuss what's driving the accelerating new account growth off of already higher numbers? And how sustainable you view account growth anywhere near these levels to be -- any color you can provide on the ramp in spend you would normally observe from new accounts as they age? And then finally, did you see a surge in new account applications from Gen Z around your Jack Harlow concert?\nSteve Squeri: I can't comment on the Jack Harlow concert, not that I can't comment on it, I'm not aware of the surgeon and account acquisition. I'm sure it didn't hurt us. Look, I think that what you've seen here is we're not going out and just trying to grab the lots and lots of cards. I mean we're out there. We're having high-value cards. And the value proposition is obviously strong. And the value propositions are really playing well with millennial and Gen Z. It's 60% of our card acquisition. And, well, I don't have the numbers handy with me in terms of how the ramping goes in year one spending here. What I would point out is we're acquiring 60% of the cards that we're acquiring are millennial and Gen Z. And that cohort was up 39% this quarter. So I think this whole concept of generational relevance in bringing people into the franchise early and bringing them in on a premium product that they can really embed their lives into has really helped us out tremendously as opposed to bringing them in on a fee-free product and then trying to upgrade them along. I think a lot of millennials and Gen Zs are using this product. And again, as we've always said, we are just a payment product. I mean, we view ourselves as a lifestyle brand and as a lifestyle product. And the Jack Harlow concert is a good example of the things that we do to embed ourselves in people's lives. And we talked about resi and we talked about travel. And those services and those bookings are going up, and people are using that. And so it's just more than just the payment product. So again, Mark, I don't have the sort of first year ramp-up spending, but 39% is a pretty good indication. As far as we're going to acquire 3.3 million cards next quarter, I don't really have any idea. I mean we'll acquire those cards that as we underwrite them, they make sense for us to go -- they will be profitable through the cycle. Could that be 3.3%? Yes, it could be 3.3, it could be 2.9, it could be 3.5. We don't -- we're not in card acquisition targets what we're looking at is acquiring those card members that meet our criteria. And it just so happened that it was 3.3 this particular quarter.\nJeff Campbell: The only two comments I would add are amongst the modest risk management adjustments we've made across the course of this year, as we have significantly actually raised our financial hurdles required for some of the new card members that we're bringing in and still just brought in a record level, which tells you something about the level of demand that we see right now due to all of the trades that Steve just talked about. I'd also point out, as I said in my earlier remarks, that, that average customer whose behavior we track every single month is coming in with much higher spend patterns, much better average credit quality and a much greater average fee component than what we were seeing pre-pandemic.\nSteve Squeri: So it's harder to qualify to get a card. We're getting more. I mean just to cut to the chase.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for the time.\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. I just wanted to understand a little bit about how you thought the FX impacted yourself in the quarter? I mean you can see a variety of ways that you present, but just want to understand from your perspective, what the \u2013 what the impact was on the revs and on the expense side, in particular, the reward side? And then give us a sense as to how you think about the revenue guidance range, if it was FX adjusted for the year and for what you're expecting in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So thank you for the question, Betsy. I will say, I think foreign exchange movements, very dramatic right now and more dramatic than they've been in many years. I think are a little difficult to communicate and hard for a lot of people to fully understand. So you've seen dramatic moves in many of the currencies that are most important to us, from the yen to the euro, to the pound. And so when you look at our revenue growth this quarter, that's why you saw a 300 basis points difference between the FX-adjusted revenue growth and the reported revenue growth 24%. Now on the bottom line, it is a much more muted impact, Betsy, because, of course, we also have a very large proportion of our colleagues outside the US to go with all that business that we do around the globe, the cost of rewards in all those countries is in the local currencies. So the impact on our earnings per share is pretty de minimis. I think we have a 10-K disclosure, where we talk about over the course of a full year movement maybe costing you $0.10. That's a quarter. So that's why I don't really call it out when I think about EPS. When you convert all that into our guidance, it's why we're very comfortable saying we're going to be above our EPS guidance range. We left our reported revenue growth number the same as it was previously. I would expect to be a couple of hundred basis points above that reported revenue guidance on an FX-adjusted basis. So I'll conclude by saying, in some ways, what we're saying is -- our revenue performance has exceeded our expectations of 90 days ago. That has sort of offset the foreign exchange headwinds, which are a little bit greater on the revenue side than what I would have expected 90 days ago. But at the bottom line, you don't really need to factor it in that much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and good morning. I'd love to get a little update on SMB and online spending. I mean, the SMB obviously is a critical business for you and just obviously growing strongly. But any color you could give on SMB, any changes? And then, online spend has actually been pretty steady. I mean, a lot of, I guess, discussion around what is the right growth rate for online spend versus off-line over the long run I think is a little bit of a decel and maybe an off-line but steady and online. So just any color on SMB and your thoughts on the long-term growth of online spending.\nSteve Squeri: Well, I mean, let's just start -- we'll talk about a little about goods and services spending, which, I mean, which is really when you start to talk about online and offline. Look, our goods and services spending is 16%, and it's -- the growth rate is split pretty evenly. In fact, off-line may be growing slightly more than online, but both in that 15% to 17% range. So -- and I think that's sustainable. I think that, obviously, online spending popped up, but offline spending is back above pre-pandemic levels. So we feel really good about both. I think consumers are -- I mean, drive past the mall. I mean, consumers are out there shopping and spending. And they're also ordering online. And so, I think, it's sort of a double hit for us in a very positive way. So we're very comfortable with the 16% goods and services spending, and that's approximately 70% of all of our spending. As far as small business, small business continues to perform very, very well. And we've had -- in this quarter, we had 17% growth, and that's -- it's a large piece of our business. And we're doing more and more things with our checking account, with Kabbage and small business loans and so forth. So we feel good about small business, and it continues to perform really well for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Shane: Guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to revisit the topic we raised last quarter. Historically, your product offerings basically caused a customer base that's positively selected for spending pay and the product offering essentially habituated them to the pattern. Now you're offering a product that offers revolve on day one. And as you move into a younger demographic, do you think over time, despite the upward move in terms of credit profile, that that will change credit performance that you will actually increase your beta to the credit cycle, because you've changed the way you habituated your customer and how you've selected them?\nJeff Campbell: Yeah. So I think, Rick, it's a good question, because you are good to point out that there's been a significant change as we have, from our perspective, added more functionality for all of our customers on what our traditional charge products. And many to most of those customers still use them as traditional charge products and leave it paying off every 30 days and some occasionally take advantage of their new functionality and being able to carry a balance if they want for a little bit. But when you think about the impact on the company, Steve used the term a couple of times today, our differentiated business model. If you look over time, our net interest income is about 19%, 20% of our overall revenues. And that's where it was many years ago. And frankly, that's where we'd expect it to be many years from now. Because as much as we see an opportunity to get a little bigger share of our both consumer and small business customers lending wallet, we grew fees 23% this quarter. And we are seeing tremendous growth in discount revenue. So we do get great growth and expect to continue to get great growth on the lending side, but I don't actually expect it to make a big difference in the overall mix of revenues that we have as a company or in the business model we have.\nSteve Squeri: No, I don't think it's going to make a difference in the mix of, as Jeff said, in the mix of our overall breakup of revenue. But I think what it also gives us an opportunity is to actually acquire more spending. And when we did not have that feature, that group may have started off with a competitive lending card or we may have put them on a blue cash have you part. And so what's happening is, and I think this bears this out in the spending numbers of 39% growth, that cohort is consolidating their spending and they're consolidating their spending with our product, and it's giving them an opportunity to earn more rewards. And so I don't really think it changes the credit profile, I think it gives us an opportunity to actually capture more spend and to ultimately capture more revenue. And the more important part is, I think the lifetime value of these customers is going to be a lot more than the lifetime value of where we acquired previously, because we're going to run these people right through. We're going to run these consumers right through the cycle and they're going to be with us from day one, and I think that's really important. So I don't think it changes the profile of our revenue. I don't think it changes the profile of the riskiness of our company, but I do think it gives us an opportunity to grow more spending and obviously to capture more revenue from this segment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. The loan growth was up, as you just mentioned, about 31%. That's really industry leading levels of loan growth. And I know you've talked about in the past that you're trying to penetrate your existing customer base. And so you've effectively underwritten these people through their spending habits over time. But you -- and you -- and a while ago, I think you provided how much of the loan growth was coming from an existing customer base spending cohort and not -- could you just provide some of the breakdowns that are giving you the supercharged loan growth versus the industry again? Thanks so much.\nJeff Campbell: Let me just start, Dominick, with a few stats that I think are important and then Steve may want to add. I mean the biggest thing driving, of course, the 31% growth in loans, tremendous growth in spending, right? So we are in a recovery mode of spending and seeing tremendous progress there. And customers are also beginning to rebuild balances a little bit. So I think it's fair and natural. So yes, I think when you look at those who have reported thus far, you're seeing industry-leading growth in loans, but you're also seeing industry-leading growth and spending. I think that's very, very important to put those two together. So I think we feel good about the trends and expect them to continue. And I would expect long-term, just as we were before the pandemic, to grow a little faster than the industry on lending and to do it while still maintaining best-in-class credit.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. And I think what's also important to realize is that this loan growth is not all revolving balances here, right? I mean, so that's an important point. But spending growth like we've had will drive overall loan growth. And yes, it's -- we've had a large year-to-date sort of spend spending in growth. But if you just look at it sort of sequentially quarter-to-quarter, because we had pretty much the same card growth, you only have about $4 billion in overall loan growth on a sequential basis. But you do have quite a bit year-over-year. So it's not like all of a sudden, this thing just jumped up, spending continues. Spending has continued on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and that drives up lending -- loan growth, excuse me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up. I think, Jeff, you had mentioned that the interest-bearing portion had continued to grow faster, kind of helping net interest income. Can you just talk about when that level is off? How does that -- and I guess, Steve had sort of mentioned just in the answer to the last question a little bit about kind of a fair amount of that growth in lending, not being kind of interest-bearing balances. So as you look at that going forward, how do you think that \u2013 how do you think that develops?\nJeff Campbell: So I would expect most for the next couple of quarters to see the revolving or interest-bearing portion of those balances grow a little bit faster than the overall loan growth because we're not quite back to pre-pandemic levels of behavior. I think our expectation is, overtime, and I think it may take a while still you will eventually get back to pre-pandemic types of behavior. The other factor I would point to goes a little bit to Rick Shane's earlier question, which is you do have this evolution going on as we've added a little bit more functionality to some of our charge products. So those customers who have the traditional charge products, but have that pay overtime feature and to use it less than your traditional credit card or revolving customers. So that's putting a little bit of complexity in tracking our numbers here. But I think in terms of watching the macro trend, I would expect loan balances to grow a little bit faster than the industry. I would expect the next couple of quarters, the revolving portion to grow a little bit faster than the loan growth, and I would expect all of those things to really set down into steady-state levels about where they were pre-pandemic.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nDon Fandetti: Yes. On the international org change, does that signal maybe a faster pace of investment? I know it's always been a balancing act in international markets. And then also, is there anything new on the tech investment strategy, so you were ramping up hiring seems a little late in the game for that?\nSteve Squeri: No. I think the tech investment strategy remains the same. And I mean, there was an article on us ramping up hiring. And there's a lot of contracted conversion that we're doing. I mean anybody that's in financial services has their own employee base and has a large contractor base. And so it's not necessarily an indication of increased headcount in technology, nor is it an indication of being late in the game. What it is an indication of is a balancing act between our contracted population and our overall colleague population. So we've been pretty steady with our investment over the last couple of years, and we'll continue that same level of tech investment this year. And what was your first question, Don? So the international piece of this, I think from an international perspective, I just think that there is -- when you run a global company, it is really important to make sure that you bring the best and the brightest to bear on all the problems and issues that you have. And when you think about acquiring card members, engaging card members and retaining card members, having a dual or a try market structure sometimes can slow down your speed and your agility versus having a single market leader looking at making what are the right investment decisions for that market. And so how many small business cards we could acquire? How many consumer cards we acquire? How do you adjudicate what customers should get a small business or a consumer card? I think this will allow us not only to get products to market faster, but to also make sure that we're putting the right investment in the right channels as we move across. As far as extra money being invested in international, we have an enterprise investment strategy, and we will put the money where the best returns are. So if we can get more returns out of investing in market A or market B versus the US or vice versa, we will do that. And the other thing that I would say, look, I've been here for a long, long time. And organizational constructs change for the times that you're in. And for the technology that's available for the value propositions that are available, I mean this is, in some ways, a little bit back to the future. We did globalize all these things, but now we feel it's better to take these global capabilities that we have and deploy them on a much more local level, with more local decision making and more adjudication between sort of the various business units. So we just think that will be a more effective and faster way. And coming out of the pandemic, I think speed of decision-making and agility will be really important.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning, Steve and Jeff\u2026\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Hi. Your PPNRB and the strength of the underlying trends certainly highlight the earnings power in the model. But I was hoping that you could address investor concerns that thinking back to the 2007 time frame, your models back then, we're saying that customers with multiple mortgages were good credits and you guys essentially grew into that recession. And while today's environment is very different, some investors are looking somewhat by analogy to that time frame and have expressed concern that you may once again be growing into the next recession and the strong spending trends that you're seeing are a reflection of the inflation problem that the Fed is trying to fight. Would love to hear your thoughts around that dynamic.\nSteve Squeri:\n\u2013 : And we manage that quite carefully. I can also say that our ability to collect is completely different than it was back then. Our models are different back then. But yes, I think people can think what they want, but would be foolish to think that we haven't changed or learned a lot. In terms of growing into the recession, what I would say is this, 80% of our growth is driven by transactions right now. So if you look at that spending number, this is not inflation, this is transactions. This is higher levels of engagement. And so the notion of us -- we're growing because we have some tailwind of inflation is also a silly notion because we're engaging our card members more. We have more transactions. We have more card members. And the last point, just going back to your first question. So is our card base is so much different than it was in 2007 from an economic perspective. It's a much more robust, resilient card-based than it was back in 2007. And also, the way we grew our balances was not necessarily just through spending back then. There's a lot of balance transfer activity. And so I think this company is a very different than it was in 2007 going into the recession. The card base is different. The way we were growing is different. We've really become much more of a spend -- a growth company. We have a lot more premium cardholders. We have a lot more fee-paying cardholders than we did. Our growth is coming from very different sources. So -- but at the end of the day, when and if you have a big downturn, we'll see what happens. But we feel pretty good about abilities and we feel pretty good about our models, and we feel really good about how our spending is being acquired right now. So we're not just riding a tailwind here, we are riding real growth through customer acquisition and increased spending from existing customers because the value propositions are driving that growth.\nJeff Campbell: And the only thing I would add is that, just like that spend is coming from existing customers, the loan growth is predominantly coming from existing customers that we know well, who have a better average credit profile, and we feel good about our winning through the cycle models that tell us these are customers who we should have in any environment. And I think I'll come back to my earlier comments about our credit reserve levels are still below everyone else in the industry. They're below relative to day one CECL where others are, and that's appropriate given our strong credit profile. So we feel good about where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow-up -- \nSteve Squeri: Hi, Lisa. Good morning.\nLisa Ellis: Hi -- on that point. Given the continued strength in your business and the fact that you're still benefiting from a lot of these sort of lagging recovery tailwinds from the pandemic, can you just update us on your thoughts on taking advantage of the current valuation environment to pursue some tuck-in M&A or other more like chunkier organic investments, for example, things that you're perhaps going to -- looking at or leaning in on in terms of accelerating areas of your business? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: I mean, chunky organic investments, I mean, you've seen how we've driven our marketing spending and to acquire Card Members while, as Jeff said, making it harder to get a card. So I think that -- I think we've leaned in on our marketing investments. We feel really good about our technology investments. And look, we're always looking at opportunities to tuck things in that makes sense for us. I mean, whether it was Kabbage or Resy or LoungeBuddy or Acompay and so forth. We're always looking at those things that will add -- will be adjacent and add to our organic core. What we're not looking for, things that are sort of outside of our universe. I think, we've proven that we can expand with our customer base. We can expand the services that we're offering and looking at additional services that lead them to more spending or lead to more acquisition opportunities, which, when you look at Resy, people look at Resy as a restaurant reservation system. We look at that as a way to engage our card members. That is a way to engage with our restaurants. And we're looking at it as a way to acquire new card members. And so -- and Acompay is another one, where it's an ability to pick up more B2B spending. So we're always on the lookout for capabilities. And if the right valuation comes along, with the right set of capabilities, yeah, we'll take advantage of it. But as far as leaning in on organic investments, I think we've leaned in. I think we've invested in marketing. We've invested in card member services. We've invested in our value proposition, and we've invested in our colleagues and continue to keep our investment levels up in technology.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning and thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to really quickly touch on the regulatory backdrop. It seems there's anything worth highlighting there from your perspective, specifically I'm thinking of the building proposal. And if that's interesting to you there, but is there anything else also on regulatory that we should be thinking about? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm here. It was really hard. I don't know if you're on a speakerphone or, it was really hard to hear you. Durbin, is that the question?\nMihir Bhatia: So yeah, I was just asking about the Durbin proposal and the regulatory backdrop.\nSteve Squeri: Okay. That's very clear now. So look, in terms of the Durbin proposal, it's a proposal. I can't speculate how this is going to come out and whether -- it obviously is not going to impact us because we're a three-party system. So we don't really see that impacting us negatively, will it impact us positively or will it actually happen? We continue to look at it, and we'll see what happens there. Look, as far as the regulatory environment, it's a tough regulatory environment. And I think in a lot of ways, the objective is to protect consumers and to be transparent with consumers, and we applaud all of that. And so I think the CFPB is talking about late fees and things like that. And these are not material parts of our revenue streams. But I think transparency with consumers is really, really important, and we obviously want to see all that. But I don't think the regulatory environment is any tougher than it's been over the last few years, and we'll continue to operate in that environment. Obviously, it adds -- sometimes it adds a little bit of cost to comply with certain things, whether that means technological changes or what have you. But it's just like competition. It really -- it's always there. And you have to make sure that you're investing to meet the regulatory guidelines, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't see it as a big headwind for us or a headwind at all for us as we move forward.\nKerri Bernstein: All right. With that, we will bring the call to an end.

Please go ahead.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.

The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks, Kerri, and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter call. We had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 31%, reaching a record high, and earnings per share were $2.57. Card Member spending was at record levels. Billed business was up 30% from a year earlier on an FX-adjusted basis, led by a vigorous rebound in travel and entertainment spending and continued strong growth in goods and services. We added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter, driven by continued strong demand for our fee-based premium products. Acquisitions of our U.S. Consumer Platinum, Gold and Delta co-brand cards were all at record highs. Customer retention and credit quality both remain at exceptionally strong levels. While our strong growth may be somewhat surprising given the uncertainties in the external environment, there are a number of reasons for our continued momentum. First, the decisions we made through the pandemic continue to pay dividends. At the outset, we made it a priority to be there for our customers, focusing on delivering great service, providing financial relief programs, expanding our Shop Small initiatives, and injecting new value into our premium consumer and business products with benefits that were relevant for the times. We then ramped up investments early in the recovery to rebuild our momentum and grow our customer base, refreshing our premium products through a series of new benefits that enhanced our generational relevance and we accelerated our acquisition engine. These decisions lay the foundation for the strength in customer retention, engagement and acquisitions that you've seen over the past year and our results today. Other key factors driving our performance include the many competitive advantages that we have that differentiate us, as well as several structural shifts, some near-term recovery tailwinds, which you remember we discussed at our Investor Day. A critical competitive advantage is our global premium customer base, which is, at scale, unrivaled in the industry, with millions of high-spending super prime, loyal consumer and business customers across generations and geographies. Importantly, millennials and Gen Z consumers are a large part of our existing customer base and our fastest-growing age cohort, making up 60% of all new consumer Card Members we're acquiring and around 75% of new U.S. consumer Platinum and Gold Card Members. Our new customers have excellent credit profiles, are highly engaged in the premium benefits that come with American Express membership, and are spending more from the start of their relationship with us than previous newcomers, giving us a long runway for growth. In fact, Spending by this age group grew 48% in the second quarter, significantly outpacing other generations. Our momentum is also being aided by several structural shifts, which we believe give us significant opportunities to sustain our growth across all lines of business over the longer term. These include the growth in the premium consumer card space around the world, the ongoing increase in online commerce and digital engagement among consumers, the strong pace of small business creation and the acceleration in the digitization -- digitizing of commercial payments. Finally, in the near-term, we're benefiting from recovery tailwinds in our businesses outside the U.S., in the large and global corporate space and in travel and entertainment. The travel rebound in particular has been faster and stronger than anyone expected. Total T&E spending exceeded pre-pandemic levels in April for the first time. It was at 108% of 2019 levels for the quarter, led by strong growth in Global Consumer and SME spending, and a significant uptick in large and global corporate travel. And we don't see demand in the T&E categories declining significantly anytime soon. Based on the strength of future bookings coming through our consumer travel agency and the trends our partners in the travel industry like Delta are experiencing, particularly in the premium space. Of course, we are wary of the uncertainties in the current economic environment and the impact it's having on our business. The historically low unemployment rate is a positive factor as it's helping to drive our strong credit metrics and we continue to see no significant signs of stress in our consumer base. Inflation is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a modest contributor to our strong growth in volumes. But inflation when combined with low unemployment also puts pressure on operating costs. For example, like everyone else, we're seeing intense competition for the best talent. But because our colleagues are a key driver of our success, we continue to invest in talent, which is having an impact on our operating expenses. Looking forward, as I've emphasized many times before, we run the company for the long-term, and our investment strategy is grounded in this principle. As we sit here today, we have an abundance of great opportunities. And we'll continue to make our decisions with a longer-term view like we did during the pandemic. That means we will continue to invest at high levels in those areas that will drive sustainable growth, including our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage. We remain confident that the successful execution of this strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Most importantly, our second quarter revenues were $13.4 billion, up 33% on an FX-adjusted basis, strengthening sequentially from last quarter's already strong 31% year-over-year growth rate. Our reported second quarter net income was $2 billion, with earnings per share of $2.57. Now as I said last quarter, given that year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the volatility that the pandemic caused in credit reserve adjustments, we are including pretax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter, which we believe gives you additional insight into the trends of our underlying earnings. On this basis, second quarter pretax pre-provision income was $3 billion, up 27% versus the same time period last year. So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, beginning with volumes. Turning on Slide 3. You can see the continued momentum in spending from our strong customer base that Steve noted earlier. Billed business and total network volumes were up around 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in the second quarter. We feel really good about both our year-over-year growth as well as our sequential growth. The second quarter saw us achieving our highest ever level of quarterly billed business. And if you were to compare to 2019, the first quarter grew 19%, while the second quarter growth rate accelerated even further to 28%. Importantly, our spending volumes strengthened as we went through the quarter, with the month of June also reaching a new monthly record high. And as we sit here today, this momentum has continued into early July. Now I would point out that when you think about year-over-year growth rates, volumes in 2021 were, of course, in a steep phase of recovery as the year progressed. So I do expect that our year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we progress through the rest of 2022. Our spending metrics are being driven by both sustained growth in goods and services spending and by an acceleration in T&E recovery in the second quarter. Starting first with goods and services spending on Slide 4. We saw a year-over-year growth of 18% in the second quarter. We are now multiple quarters into seeing the effects of the structural shift in online commerce spending patterns, which is accelerated by the pandemic, with our growth rates remaining steady. Specifically, online and card-not-present spending grew 15% in the second quarter. In contrast, total T&E spending, as you see on Slide 5, showed an acceleration in its recovery this quarter even more than we and many others would have expected, reaching 108% of 2019 levels. The high demand for travel will be a steep recovery across all customer types. This strength in both goods and services and T&E spending is also evident as we break spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, with a few other key points that I'd suggest you take away. First, beginning on Slide 6, millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest global consumer billed business growth, with their spending up 48% year-over-year. I'd also call out that this quarter, all other age cohorts have now reached pre-pandemic levels of T&E spending, including baby boomers, who had been slower to recover. In our commercial business, on Slide 7, spending from our small- and medium-sized enterprise clients continues to drive our overall growth, with spending up 25% year-over-year. While a smaller part of our business, it is worth noting the significant acceleration in growth of 58% of the large and global corporate customers, significantly above last quarter's growth rate. This is a sign of a more meaningful business travel recovery. So overall, we are pleased that our strength in spending volumes has exceeded our original expectations for the year. And again this quarter, the majority of our high level of growth was driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network, with some modest additional impact from inflation. This positions us well for our long-term growth aspirations. Moving on now to receivable and loan balances on Slide 8. We saw a good sequential growth in our loan balances, which are now well above pre-pandemic levels this quarter. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarter-over-quarter, but remains a bit below 2019 levels, as paydown rates have remained elevated. As you then turn to credit and provision , on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And though they did continue to tick up slightly overall this quarter, as we expected, they are trending a bit better than our expectations when we started the year. Turning then to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. As you know, there are a couple of key drivers of provision expense. First, actionable credit performance, which, as we just discussed, is extremely strong; and second, changes in credit reserves under the CECL methodology. We built a small amount of reserves this quarter as our loan balances grew and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our CECL models got slightly worse relative to the outlook back in Q1, both partially offset by improved portfolio quality. This reserve build, combined with our low net write-offs, drove $410 million of provision expense for the second quarter. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $3.2 billion of reserves, representing 3.1% of our loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This remains well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic. Going forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time, but to remain well below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, given our expected loan growth. But the overall range and timing of reserve adjustments will be heavily influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves between now and the end of the year. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 31% year-over-year in the second quarter or 33% on an FX adjusted basis, as we continue to see a stronger U.S. dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate. Overall, these results were above our original expectations. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up sharply at 79% growth year-over-year, largely driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues that accelerated this quarter, with cross-border spend in particular surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 32% year-over-year in Q2 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 13, driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and the accelerated T&E recovery that you saw in our spending trends. Net card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth continuing to accelerate, as you can see on Slide 14, largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter, we acquired 3.2 million new cards, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum Card numbers again reaching a record high and increasing 20%, above last quarter's record levels, demonstrating the great demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products. Moving on to net interest income. On Slide 15, you can see that it was up 31% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, accelerating above last quarter's growth rate due to the continued recovery of our revolving loan balances. Looking forward, while I would expect our loan balances to continue to recover at higher growth rates, the rising rate environment will likely cause our net interest income growth rate to slow given our sizable non-interest-bearing charge balances. To sum up on revenues on Slide 16. We're seeing continued strong results and sustained momentum across the board. So looking forward, we now expect to see revenue growth of 23% to 25% for the full year of 2022. So the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in as expected, at 42% of total revenues for the quarter, and are tracking with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to run at around 42% of total revenues on a full year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the second quarter. We feel really good about the strong demand for new card acquisitions , as we showed on Slide 14. More importantly, we feel good about the spend, credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing in to American Express membership, which continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. I would now expect to spend a little over $5 billion on marketing in 2022. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.3 billion in the second quarter. There's often some quarterly volatility in this number due to the varied timing of certain accruals and entries. This quarter, for example, we see the impact of the prior year including a sizable benefit from net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. As I said last quarter, and as Steve discussed earlier, inflation, while driving some modest positive impact on volumes, it's also putting pressure on our operating expenses, particularly in our compensation costs. Taking everything into account, we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around $13 billion, as we invest in our talented colleague base, technology and other key underpinnings of our growth given our tremendously high levels of revenue growth. Turning next to capital on Slide 18. We returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock repurchases of $611 million and $394 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3% at the end of the second quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. Given the concerns about the macro economy and the market, it is worth noting that in the Fed's CCAR stress test results released last month, American Express was again one of the few firms that remained cumulatively profitable under the Fed's macroeconomic stress scenario and we had the highest profit margin as a percentage of assets of any participating bank. That brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on Slide 19. Our performance year-to-date and our full year guidance reinforce several points that Steve and I have now both discussed. First and most importantly, we clearly have momentum across all of the areas critical for us to drive sustained high levels of revenue growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention, evidenced by our strong Q2 results. Inflation is additionally providing some modest benefit to our revenues. The combination of all of these things led us to increase our expectations for full year revenue growth to 23% to 25%, up from our original range of 18% to 20%. For now, though, our EPS guidance remains unchanged from between $9.25 and $9.65. Let me walk you through our thinking here. As I talked about earlier, we feel really good about the strong results generated by our marketing investments this year. And that's why we now expect to spend a little over $5 billion for the full year, modestly above our original expectations. Both Steve and I also talked about the fact that there are some pressures on our operating expenses, particularly around compensation and partially fueled by inflation. And therefore, we now expect our operating expenses to be around $13 billion this year. Lastly and most importantly, as we think about our EPS this year, as I talked about in the credit section, while our credit performance and metrics remain extremely healthy, we can't predict how the macroeconomic outlook will evolve. That makes it difficult sitting here today to predict a precise range of outcomes for any potential CECL reserve adjustments for the balance of the year. That said, should the macroeconomic outlook not change meaningfully between now and the end of the year, and therefore, not have a large impact on current reserves in the balance of the year, we would expect to be at or even a bit above the high end of our EPS guidance range. In any environment, we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thanks, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.\nRyan Nash : Maybe just to start on revenue growth, Steve. So it's obviously coming in much better than expected, and you're choosing to invest more to propel future growth. So I was just hoping maybe you can just talk a little bit about the additional investments that you're making across the company, whether it's in OpEx or in Card Member engagement. How much of this is offensive versus -- to drive revenue growth versus defensive? And then given the acceleration of investments that we're seeing through '22, could this position us for better revenue growth in the intermediate time frame?\nStephen Squeri : So I think everything that we're doing here is offensive. I mean you could argue that raising compensation is defensive. But I think you're going to -- you've seen compensation being raised across. So if I break out the categories, you're going to see OpEx up. And you see an OpEx up for 2 reasons. #1, we are investing a little bit more in -- from an operating perspective. But that investment -- the main investment from an operating perspective is you can't grow your billings 30%, and with the majority of those billings being grown by 30% by more transactions without having more people to be able to serve your customers, to be able to engage with them from a travel perspective. And you have to remember, one of the huge differentiating factors that we have in our business model is our ability to serve our customers when and where they need to be served. And as you get more and more transactions, as you get more and more customers, you do have this step function increase. And so a lot of our operating expense growth has been done -- has been to the addition of people, which is not maybe a popular topic right now that people are talking about, but we're adding people. We're not subtracting people from our business. And we're adding people to make sure that we can continue the level of service that we had. And I don't mind doing that, especially in a growth environment, which is what we're expecting. Well, look, you're also seeing wage increase, and you have to pay more to keep your best talent. And so we will do that. That is [indiscernible] not to do that, and we will continue to do that. From a marketing perspective, I've been doing this for a number of years now. And one of the things that you hear us say is we have lots and lots of good investment opportunities. And to let those investment opportunities go by the Board because, we thought we might have spent $5 billion, but maybe it will be $5.2 billion, whatever, that's shortsighted because we're running the company for the longer-term. So I would say that the investments that we're making -- and additional investments in technology are truly all longer -- all thinking about the long-term here. As far as revenue goes for next year, look, we're building up momentum. But I think when we came out and said we were going to grow 18% to 20% this year, there was probably some scepticism. And now we're coming out and saying we're going to go 23% to 25%, which is going to put the level of revenue at the end of this year obviously higher than what we thought. We have a plan to get us to -- in 2024 at 10% plus revenue growth on a sustainable basis, which means in 2023, we'll certainly exceed 10%. What that number will actually be? I don't know sitting here right now. I don't know. But I can tell you it will be on our growth trajectory. And as long as we have good revenue opportunities and as long as we can continue to grow this business, I will continue to invest. And that's where we are. And as Jeff said, we've decided not to -- and I think it's really important. We've decided not to raise our earning -- our EPS guidance because of the uncertainty with CECL, which, quite honestly, we don't have a lot of control over. And so for us to sit here today and say, hey, look, let's just raise it to then come back in the third quarter or the fourth quarter and say, hey, we had to drop it, it's just -- it's fool hearted. But the revenue, it's what we see. And so when we're asked questions about, what do you think about the economy and you see a slowdown? If I was thinking there was a slowdown in the next couple of quarters, I wouldn't be sitting here raising revenue to 23% to 25%. So that's how I think about it.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.\nSanjay Sakhrani : T&E was a big driver of the upside. And I think, Jeff, you mentioned there's been further strength in July, which makes sense given we're moving into the heart of the summer months. Are you guys concerned this is sort of a pull forward, and you see a slowdown thereafter? And maybe that ties into what we saw in corporate T&E because that also moved up quite a bit. Where do you think the new normal shakes out?\nStephen Squeri : So if you look at where we are right now, and yes, we're at a 100 -- we're at 8% growth over 2019. And that's not really a big number when you think about it. When you think about 8% growth over 2019 from a T&E perspective and you think about sort of airline prices, you think about some of the inflation built in, I'd say there's more room to run on T&E. And when you disaggregate sort of T&E, and you look at it, and you see that the consumer is running sort of 38% above and you've got international consumer running only 8% above and you got SME running probably 8% above and corporate travel is only 60% of what it was in 2019, I wouldn't call out a pull forward. And when I look at my bookings, my future bookings in my consumer business, they're strong. And then when you get -- then you sort of disaggregate and you go below those numbers, and you look and you say, okay, what's really driving it? And you see a tremendous growth, right? We're seeing a tremendous growth, like 48% growth in restaurant. Lodging is huge. Airline is way up. But lodging and airlines are still below 2019 levels in aggregate. So -- and the airline industry is probably only about 85%, 90% of their capacity. And they have some staffing issues and what have you, and they're sort of canceling. So I don't think this is a pull-forward at all. I think there's a huge pent-up demand, obviously, to get out and travel and see the world or see anybody at this particular point in time. But no, I'm not really concerned about a pullback because I don't think we've gotten to a normal level yet. I really don't believe we've gotten to a normal level of T&E. So now we're going to see 90% year-over-year growth rates, no. But I look at absolute aggregate numbers, and I can't get too focused on just the growth rates. We're not at a normal level of T&E yet in our business.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck : Yes. It's really great, great results here. I wanted to dig in a little bit on how you're thinking about the loan growth on the SME side. I know that's been accelerating here. Just give us a sense as to where pockets of opportunity are and how you would flex if there was a slowdown.\nStephen Squeri : Look, we're -- our stated goal for our SME business is be the working capital provider for small businesses. And so I think that what we're trying to do is to be able to provide liquidity to them using cards. We've got some short-term working capital loans. We've got some shorter-term term loans and they're taking advantage of it. But I'll send you back to the pandemic. I mean when you look at our small business base, I think everybody was really concerned about how stressed this was because -- or how stressed this could be because of what the perception is the makeup of small businesses. And I've said this over and over again. When people think about small businesses, they think about restaurants and they think about small retail on Main Street and it's much more than that. And so I think that -- and you saw how we performed. I mean our credit metrics performed brilliantly through the pandemic. And we've always grown in the last few years a little bit -- well, pre-pandemic, we've always grown faster than the market. We have a very low share of our small businesses lending volume relative to their spending volume. I mean we probably have over 40% of their spending volume, but 40% of the spending level, but we have less than maybe 20% of the land. So there is opportunity, and we will go after this opportunity the same way we go after everything else, in a very measured, analytical and risk-adjusted way. And so we're not trying to grow crazily. We are just providing our customers with what they need. Having said that, I think you've seen our ability to pivot, and if need be, we will pivot again. But what I do really love about our small business base, not only that it continues to grow, but it is so diverse across so many different types of industries, and that's really, really, really important.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair.\nBob Napoli : Also congratulate you on a super strong numbers. Really great to see. I guess maybe a question on network coverage, one of your key areas of focus and incremental investment. And just maybe any update on how you're performing versus your plan on network expansion. Either kind of -- obviously, international seems like where you have the most opportunity from a network expansion. Any thoughts on or any metrics you can give on international and your thoughts on where your coverage should be internationally over the long term?\nStephen Squeri : Yes. Look, I mean, we -- from a U.S. perspective, we continue to remain in parity coverage, and as we -- virtual parity coverage. And as we said, it doesn't mean you're not going to run into somebody that doesn't accept the card now and again. But usually, it's -- when we do that, we're able to sign them up because it's sort of old news in terms of what the rates are and how we -- and so forth. So I'm not really can -- I should say, I'm not concerned about the U.S. But I like where we are in the U.S. and I like our approach to the U.S. From international, I think we've been really, really, really clear. We've been focusing on priority cities and continuing to drive those numbers higher, and those continue to do well. We've probably signed well over 3 million merchants this year, which is -- I think we're on pace to sign as many as we did last year from an international perspective. And we'll continue to provide information, not on a quarterly basis, but on an as-needed basis to show you that the progress that we're making. But we're really pleased with the progress that we're making in our priority cities. And that doesn't mean we're not focused on signing every merchant that doesn't accept the card. We do. But we think it's more important to sign those merchants where Card Members actually are. And that's why the priority cities and the priority countries are so important for us. And we feel really good about it. And you only have to look at the international spending to say, is it really working? And when you look at sort of our international spending this year, it's up higher than our consumer spending year-over-year for this quarter. So it's a big driver for growth for us.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Barclays.\nMark DeVries : I had a question for Steve about the 48% growth in millennial and Gen Zs. I assume it's normal for the younger generations to have stronger growth, just as a combination of what I assume are kind of stronger new account acquisitions and also just the ramping of spend as they age and their incomes grow. Can you give us a sense of what the breakdown is in that 48% between new account acquisition and then actual organic spend on an individual account basis? I know you indicated that they are spending more than previous newcomers. But any sense of kind of dimensionalizing that, how that compares? And then just finally on comparing across the different cohorts, kind of how -- what your market share is for these newer cohorts compared to Gen X and boomers at points in their age?\nStephen Squeri : Yes. So we don't really get into all of that either in our release or talk about. But let me give you a couple of points. When we look at sort of how we're getting card member spending, we really look at share of wallet. Share of wallet is really important for us. And from millennials and Gen Zs, we're getting a higher share of their wallets off the bat. That's key. Because what happens is, with a lot of our boomers and so forth, and especially our boomers, they were used to an American Express that was accepted in a limited universe. Our Gen Z and our millennials are used to an American Express that's really accepted everywhere. And so we're able to penetrate their wallets more right out of the gate because, number one, they're more card savvy, and they tend to use no cash. And they're more value proposition savvy, and they tend to figure out how to utilize the card in the best way for them. And so we're getting a higher percentage of their wallet. As they grow, as their wallets grow, as they progress through life, our aim is to continue to keep that wallet share. And that's a big deal. Plus, as you acquire Gen Zs and millennials, they tend to have a longer runway for tenure with the card product. As far as the 48% growth and breaking it out sort of -- I mean, really what you're asking for is same-store sales versus new store sales. I don't really have that at the tip of my fingertips here.\nJeff Campbell : Yes. We don't disclose the exact numbers, Mark. But we do pull it apart, just like you described. And we certainly have made the point that a disproportionate share of our new account acquisitions are going to that millennial and Gen Z demographic. But then when you break out, just to Steve's raised the same-store sales, it is also the fastest-growing demographic on a same-store sales basis. So both contribute, both the same-store sales effect and the fact that they are disproportionate, and our new customers.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele : Great. Obviously, you're reporting incredibly strong recovery spending numbers. If you just think about the spending cycle and inflation boosting nominal PCE versus real PCE, how should we think about the effects on your high-end consumer base versus the average U.S. consumer in terms of their susceptibility to a spending slowdown? And perhaps, why could this customer base that you have act differently versus the average consumer in the next spending cycle? And I'm just talking about total spending, if you -- if that works.\nStephen Squeri : Well, I think the simple answer is they have more money. But when you look at sort of what's going on in the economy and the stock market going up and down, we we've never really been tied to that. I mean -- and I've been here for forever, right, 35 years or so. And I've never seen a correlation between that. What I have seen a correlation between is sort of unemployment and people losing their jobs and not being able to pay their bills. And so that's potentially an issue down the road. But we're in a very crazy sort of environment, and Jeff called this out in his own remarks. I mean, we've got high inflation and low unemployment. And it's actually hard to hire people right now. And so yes, you're seeing some layoffs and some companies talking about slowing down their hiring and things like that. But it's not broad based and it's not broad scale at this particular point in time. And so I think as far as I look at this -- the cohort that we have, which is a small segment, right, of the U.S. population, but a very powerful segment of the U.S. population, you would have to see a huge credit crunch driven by unemployment, I think, for this cohort to be hit. The other thing I would say is, when we pull apart our numbers, this spending is not inflation-driven. And that's not to say there's not inflation in these numbers. But you have to remember that coming out at the end of last year, when no one wanted to talk about it, we had inflation in those numbers last year. So whether you look at 8% or 9% sort of spending inflation out there in the environment, it's not an 8% -- 8% or 9% benefit to our business because you do have a grow over. But the most important thing for us is we're seeing an increase in transactions. And that's what's really driving our growth right now, is an increase in overall transactions in our business. And that's an important indicator for us. We look at not only transactions, but we look at transaction size. And then we look at that transaction size a little bit on a normalized basis as you take the effects of inflation out. And we've got real growth when you do that.\nJeff Campbell : Yes. The only thing I'd add is that we have said consistently, a modest level of inflation, and I'd still use the word modest for where we are, absent a spike in unemployment, like Steve said, is generally net a positive thing for our business. It helps revenues a little bit. It puts a little pressure on cost. But it nets to a positive. And as long as the labor market stays where it is, that's why we feel pretty good about the guidance we've given you for the rest of the year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache : Could you speak to how much the competitive environment for high spending customers has intensified post pandemic, particularly as other issuers look to compete beyond cash rewards to provide their customers with greater experiential value by investing in things like airline lounges, travel portals and the like? And then I guess more specifically on -- if I may just squeeze in on the acceleration in spending among large global corporates. Could you discuss which products are enjoying the greatest uplift there?\nStephen Squeri : Yes. I mean, this environment has been a highly competitive environment since the financial crisis. And it hasn't really changed. Yes, I mean people invest in more things. I mean we've all raised the price of poker here a little bit. But we figure our competitors will continue to invest. We figure that our competitors will copy what we're doing. And that's why it's important for us to stay ahead. And so has it intensified? I mean we just work under the assumption. it's a highly competitive environment, and it will remain a highly competitive environment. And you're really talking about the U.S. consumer segment, but you've got high competition in small business. You've got high competition in various markets. You've got high competition in corporate card. But what we strive to do is put the best products and services out there. And that's worked out pretty well for us. And so it requires a little bit more investment. It requires investment across the board. But in the long run, I think you just have to look at the results. And right now, we're acquiring more cards than we've ever acquired. But we've said this before. What's really important for us is that we're looking to acquire revenues and we're looking to acquire billed business. We talk in terms of cards. But those cards are generating new billed business and generating revenue for us, obviously, because we're raising our revenue guidance. As far as corporate, I'm not sure I really understand the question all that much. But we only have a corporate card. So -- and yes, companies are spending. But we're only at 60 -- our T&E is only at 60%. And Jeff, where are we overall on corporate card spending? I don't know.\nJeff Campbell : It's a little higher because the travel never went down as much. So the overall number is at about closer to 80% pre-pandemic.\nStephen Squeri : So -- but we're not back yet. But you're seeing pockets of it and consultants are back out there on the road and bankers are back out there on the road. And I think people are having a lot more meetings. I know we had one in June, and it was hard to get conference room space for like 100 or 150 people. And even looking to book for next year for the same type of meeting, boy, people are out there booking 1 year, 1.5 years in advance. And I think that's good for the lodging business. It's good for the airline business. It's good for us. So that's kind of where it is.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Lisa Ellis of MoffetNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : Steve and Jeff, you've commented earlier on some of the near-term investments that you're making given the strong growth in top line you're seeing in wages and marketing, et cetera. Can you also comment a bit perhaps on some of the longer-term investments that you're leaning in on, kind of taking advantage of the strong growth in the business to be able to lean in and position Amex even better for the next sort of 3 to 5 years?\nStephen Squeri : Yes. Well, I mean, we're always making -- there's always the balance between long-term investments and short-term investments. And we don't talk a lot about the long-term investments until they actually happen. But you have to invest in your technology, and we've done that. And I've talked about that before because we've been one of the only companies that have said, we're not taking step function changes in our technology investment because we've been investing in technology all along. We're constantly investing in value proposition. And when people look at that, and we sit here on the phone here and we talk about it, like, okay, so what are you going to do to the Platinum Card? Well, it's not the Platinum Card. It's the 29 proprietary countries that we operate in, the small business cards that we operate in those countries and the corporate cards we operate in those countries and the co-brand cards we operate in those countries and the personal cards, Green, Gold, Platinum and Centurion. So we're constantly investing, and I think we use the Platinum Card in the U.S. either business or personal as a proxy for our overall investment, and that's not it, because we're investing in all our card products across the globe on an ongoing basis. You can't have product refreshes by just snapping your fingers and saying, hey, we're going to have a product refresh. This is months and months and months in the making and negotiations and partnerships and so forth. But look, we continue to invest in our lounge program. We continue to look at those things that add more value. I mean you've seen the expansion of things that we've done, whether it's checking accounts and debit cards for our consumers and our small businesses. And what we're trying to do is to create more stickiness and more reason to interact with American Express on an ongoing basis. I mean just look at sort of how the services around our card products have evolved over the last few years, whether that be from a small business perspective where we can meet a wide variety of reworking capital needs, banking needs and so forth, and then look at it from a consumer perspective and look at what we've done with resi, with over 30 million registered users on resi, and we have cards on file, a huge acquisition. So we'll continue to make those longer-term investments, but you'll continue to hear about them as they happen.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.\nMoshe Orenbuch : Great. And Steve, certainly note your comments that you're not anticipating a recession in the next couple of quarters given what you're seeing in your customer base. But could you just talk conceptually about how you think about account acquisition in terms of kind of new accounts, a high level of new accounts? Obviously, industry as a whole is still doing that. But clearly, less seasoned accounts are the ones that always would carry somewhat more risk. And maybe talk about the things you do to kind of mitigate that or steps you would take if you saw that and the rates start to rise?\nJeff Campbell : Well, let me maybe start, Moshe, by just reminding everyone of the highly analytical process we have for determining who we bring into membership in the franchise. And it's based on searching for that premium customer, whether they are a consumer or a small business. It's based on the vast amounts of data and history we have. And it's based on having very high financial cutoffs for who we allow into the franchise or not. And when you look at the outcome of that process right now, we are on average bringing in new customers who have higher credit qualities than we saw pre-pandemic in 2019, who are showing much higher spending profiles and who are also carrying balances at a greater rate. So we feel really good about the people we're bringing into the franchise. And as you've heard Steve and I and Doug and others talk about, we also always when we bring people in, model their results assuming there will be a recession. I don't know when there will be a recession, but there will be. And so we build a through-the-cycle view of the economics right into our upfront calculation of whether we think it's a good idea or not to bring a given customer into the franchise at a given level of marketing spend.\nStephen Squeri : Yes. And the other thing I'd say is that changes -- that can change daily. That can change weekly. Those criteria could change monthly. It all depends on how we're looking at and what our models are showing and what we're feeling. The other reality is we could lower our thresholds, spend even a lot more money. But there's that balance that you have and that balance of making sure that we're growing the bottom line is -- in an appropriate fashion and also making sure that we have a higher quality consumer and small business as part of our franchise. But it is something that's been developed over many, many years. And it's not static. I mean I think that's the key point. This thing is not static. And we continue to adjust it and modify it.\nJeff Campbell : Steve, the other thing I would add, and I'm going to quote you, is we run the company for the long term. We make these decisions on a through-the-cycle basis. There will be a recession at some point. I don't know when. But the thing about recessions is, they're always followed by a recovery. And we're running the company to achieve the highest possible sustainable level of long-term growth. And we think that the process we have and the analytics we have for bringing people into the franchise are very consistent with that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Donat of Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Donat : I wanted to dig -- try to dig a little deeper on the travel and entertainment recovery and the Slide 23 you had and revisit the question of a possible pull forward. I heard the commentary around bookings, and so that seems good for visibility for airlines and lodging. What I'm wondering about is, should there be any reason to be concerned around restaurant spending, which has been really strong? And is restaurant spending highly correlated with lodging and airlines so maybe we don't need to worry about it? Or just if you're seeing anything that could be a cause for concern and maybe a future pullback in restaurants...?\nStephen Squeri : The only thing I would say is that if restaurant spending is really highly correlated with lodging and airlines, you're going to expect it to go up. But I think, look, I mean, anybody that's been to a restaurant, prices are a little bit higher because they're -- they got wages and they got fluid costs and so forth. But look, from my perspective, restaurants really -- sort of a lot of them change their business models during the pandemic because restaurants that weren't doing takeout do take out. And so people are eating out a lot more, and they're spending more time at restaurants and ordering for restaurants. So no, I really don't think it's highly correlated at all. And in fact, if you took restaurant out, and we just said travel, and travel being defined as car rental, lodging and air, we're not back yet, right? What's pulling T&E over the finish line here to go past that 2019 is truly restaurants. So if anything, as people travel more, you might see more restaurant spending. And the other side of that is, well, you won't see more restaurant spending because now lead to different locations. So I don't think it's -- I don't think a pullback here will really hurt restaurants all that much.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan.\nRick Shane : When I think about the numbers, 2 things stand out. One is the loan growth and the other is obviously the strong penetration for millennial and Gen Z card growth. I am curious if -- as millennials and Gen Z customers are taking cards, if those are being delivered with additional features enabled on borrow? Or are there behavioral factors that are causing your younger demographic to borrow more?\nJeff Campbell : Well, maybe I'll start, Steve. So first, we have moved over the last couple of years, Rick, to add to the majority of our charge products a pay over time capability. For existing Card Members, that phases in in a variety of ways. For new Card Members, that capability is on as it is as they get the card. So I do think that has some impact on our results. There also is a demographic feature, as I talked about earlier. If you look at who we're bringing into the franchise now, and there is a skew towards the millennials and Gen Zs, they are higher spending, higher credit quality. And there is a propensity to carry balances that is a little higher than what we see in the older demographic.\nStephen Squeri : Yes. And they also tend to use our pay and plan it feature a little bit more, which is -- and I'll use these words, buy now, pay later, but on the back end as opposed to a point of sale. I mean, they can go on to their statement and decide, look, for this particular charge, I'm going to pay it in 6 installments, and I'm going to pay it at $100 a month. But I'm going to pay the rest of my balance in full. So I think that ability of looking at your statement, deciding which things you might want to pay in an installment, deciding which thing you might want to use Pay with Points to pay, deciding which thing you may want to revolve and then deciding which things you want to pay in full is a pretty good feature of the product. And so when you look at meeting somebody's entire payment needs, that kind of does it in one-stop shopping.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia : I wanted to ask a little bit about just longer term, right? I mean I appreciate your comments about making investments now while the opportunity is available. But I was wondering just longer term, for example, in 2023, you've guided to longer -- higher than longer-term revenue growth in 2023. So will that also translate in higher than long-term EPS growth or higher than long-term PPNR growth? Or is there just so much white space available for you, just the amount of growth opportunity that 2023 could also be another big investment year? Just trying to understand how you balance that all this revenue upside you see versus the investment opportunities available to you.\nJeff Campbell : Well, I can't resist my start by pointing out that, yes, Steve and I talked a lot about the heavy investments that we're making this year. We're also growing our pretax pre-provision profit by 27% this quarter, in line with the 31% revenue growth. Look, as Steve said earlier, we'll have to see. I think we feel really good about the revenue momentum we have. And so just mathematically, given our long-term sustainable goals and a steady-state environment for 2024 and beyond, I expect to be above that -- easily above the 10% level on revenue growth next year. How much? Don't know. We'll have to see. And that provides a pretty darn good platform for good earnings growth. All that said, it's only July 22. We haven't given you guide -- specific guidance for next year. And the wildcard from a GAAP EPS perspective in all this is the volatility that you've seen so much of in the last 10 quarters in the CECL credit reserves because we have good, I think, visibility and beliefs about the trajectory of our own business. But the consensus macroeconomic forecast and how it evolves is going to have a big influence on what we book for credit reserves.\nStephen Squeri : But just think of how those 2 numbers that Jeff threw out, 31% revenue growth and 27% PPNR growth. Would you have felt better if it was 32%, and we decided not to invest? I wouldn't. And I think what's really important, and I'll take you back to Investor Day. This is a flywheel. Scale is important. Scale begets more scale. And not crazy scale, but scale with premium Card Members from a small business perspective and a consumer perspective that merchants want to see and merchants want to provide value to, which continues that strength in the flywheel. And that's one thing. As you know, we talked about, do you see more competition? The one thing that is really, really hard to replicate, and we haven't used these words, but this enclosed cycle that we have, otherwise known as the famous closed loop, the ability to have those merchants and have those Card Members and to be able to feed off one another from a value perspective is really, really critical. And the value that we're able to provide merchants with high spending Card Members and the value that those merchants are able to provide to our Card Members is really, really important. And so as we sit here and look at our business and look at it long term, what's really important is that growth and that sustainable growth. And again, throw all the noise out around CECL and credit reserve releases and bills and so forth. And if you focus on that number, well, 31% and 27% is pretty good. And so we feel really good about the level of investment that we've made in the business. And quite honestly, don't necessarily focus on any of those individual line items, but focus on the aggregate in what it's driving and the value it's creating. And if you're just going to measure value through a quarterly EPS growth, you're missing the point. What you need to measure value is on how sustainable your business model is over the long term. And all we're doing is enhancing our business model over the long term with these investments.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo.\nDon Fandetti : Can you provide an update on B2B progress? Are you seeing small businesses accelerate their automation of accounts payable and also, large corporates on the supplier side, are they accepting more cards?\nStephen Squeri : The short answer is yes. We don't -- we're not sharing all the statistics, but small businesses continue. When you look at our small business base, probably over 80% of their spending is B2B spending versus T&E spending. And we continue to see acompay go up for us. Our partnerships continue to yield more value. We're seeing -- what Jeff talked about it, we're about 80% of where we were from a corporate card perspective, but yet only 60% from a travel perspective. So that's driven by more B2B. But it's not -- when you look at that automation of B2B, some of it is automation of existing business, especially in the small businesses. Some of it is growth. But it still continues to be a long-term play. But you're seeing more suppliers take it. And we'll continue to work towards getting more acceptance and leveraging our flexible model here to be able to work with suppliers and our small businesses and our corporations to drive more acceptance and to drive more spend.\nKerri Bernstein: Great.

We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results; and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we will move to Q&A on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day last month, we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our businesses and explain why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for 2024 and beyond. As we said then, our confidence is based on three interrelated factors: the success of the strategy we've been pursuing over the past several years, which focuses on investing in our brand, customers, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent to build share, scale and relevance. The momentum we've been generating through the effective execution of that strategy; and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are contributing to our momentum. The strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the full year, despite the uncertain macro environment, and they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term aspirations. For the quarter, revenues were $11.7 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and earnings were -- earnings per share were $2.73. These results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to sustainable long-term growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention, as well as outstanding credit performance. New proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace, reaching three million this quarter, which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, particularly among Millennial and Gen Z consumers, and small and medium-sized businesses in the US. We had an all-time high in acquisitions of US Consumer Platinum and Gold cards, as well as US business Platinum Cards this quarter. Delta card acquisitions reached an all-time monthly high in March, an indication of the growing demand for travel-related products and services. Regarding customer engagement, we look at a variety of indicators to measure progress. For example, Card Member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow with daily active users across the web and mobile, up double digits over last year. We're also seeing strong engagement with the new benefits we added to our \u2013 [Indiscernible] consumer Platinum card, particularly among millennial and Gen Z card members nearly half in whom have used at least one of the new travel and lifestyle benefits to-date. And we continue to see an acceleration in customer engagement with our resi dining platform, including strong double-digit growth over the last quarter in a number of Amex cards on file and a number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program. March was one of resi's best months on record for reservations, up nearly 16% over February. Ultimately, the key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth. Overall bill business grew 35% in Q1 global year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, and we saw our highest volumes ever in March, surpassing our previous highest of December of 2021. Spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and Gen Z consumers up 56% and SME is up 30% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Goods and services spending continued to accelerate in the quarter, growing 21% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Travel and entertainment spending was up 121% globally on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year, driven by strong growth in consumer travel spending. Customer retention remains at the very high levels I mentioned at Investor Day, an indication of the value our customers continue to place in Amex membership. A major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships, which go well beyond our large strategic partners like Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We continue to extend relationships with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model. For example, last week, we announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard, exclusive for our U.S. consumer card members, which brings together Vanguard's digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our industry-leading membership rewards. This is just the latest example of how we're expanding our value propositions beyond their traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers' financial and lifestyle needs. In addition, we're accelerating our focus on fintechs to drive more innovation, including our new partnership with i2c, which will enable fintechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the American Express network. We also continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives, which are important components of our overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers, communities and colleagues thrive so does our company. On a diversity equity inclusion front, we are more than three quarters away towards our goal of investing $1 billion in a wide range of actions by 2024, including increasing spend with diverse suppliers, providing resources and financial assistance to minority-owned SMEs in the U.S. and maintaining pay equity across genders globally and ethnicities in the U.S. among other efforts. Our DEI progress was cited as one of the key reasons, along with our flexible work policies for our number eight ranking on Fortune's 2022 list of the Best U.S. companies to work for, which was announced last week. This is the third consecutive year we've been in the top 10, which helps us attract and retain talent. And we recently announced a series of initiatives coinciding with Earth Month that are designed to engage our customers, community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including the goal of significantly expanding the use of recycled plastic in our card products. These initiatives build on the work we've already done and continue our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint, including our commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035. In summary, with this solid start to the year, the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from the pandemic, we're reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% and earnings per share of between $9.25 and $9.65. Furthermore, we remain confident that successful execution of our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter. Thank you.\nJeff Campbell: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2022 and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and with our aspiration to build growth momentum beyond 2022. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2. Most importantly, our first quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, up 31% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the momentum we have built and our longer-term growth aspirations. Our reported first quarter net income was $2.1 billion with earnings per share of $2.73. As you know, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging for the industry over the past two years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments. For that reason, we thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pre-tax pre-provision income. That number was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 16% versus the comparable number in 2021, reflecting growth in our core earnings. So now let's get into a little more detailed look at our results, starting with volumes. As you can see in our slides, we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a year-over-year basis, moving away from the comparisons to 2019 that we have done in recent quarters. We think that returning to a focus on year-over-year comparison gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to maintain as we look towards our longer term growth objectives. Starting on slide 3. Total network volumes and build business were both up over 30% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX adjusted basis, strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters. And as Steve highlighted, intra-quarter, while Omicron slowed growth in January and early February, we then saw a strong acceleration in March, with that month achieving our highest ever level of monthly build business. And I would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the number of transactions flowing through our network with only a modest impact from inflation. Now as I talked about at our Investor Day last month and as slide 4 reiterates, the majority of our build business is spending on goods and services from our consumer and small and medium sized enterprise customers. And as you can see on slide 5, business service spending remained robust in the first quarter with year-over-year growth reaching 21%, slightly above the 2021 exit rate. This momentum is from strong growth in online and card not present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened, demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that we've seen accelerated by the pandemic. And while T&E spending is a smaller portion of our total billings, you see on slide 6 that it is now strongly supporting our growth momentum, with overall T&E spending growing 121% year-over-year. T&E spending did show a dip in January and early February due to the Omicron variant, but spending rebounded tremendously, reflecting pent-up travel demand and essentially reached 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the month of March. And this kind of T&E spending growth has continued right into early April. When you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we begin to do on slide 7, there are a few other key points I'd suggest you take fully. First, our millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up 56% year-over-year and spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter. Also of note, global consumer T&E volumes overall were back above 2019 levels as of the first quarter, led by the growth in the US. Second, our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping SME clients run their businesses continues to drive strong growth in overall SME spending, up 30% in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both the US and international. While a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment, I would point out that our large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery, especially in the latter part of the quarter with a year-over-year growth rate for the quarter of 42%. So overall, we are pleased with the growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term expectations. As you then move to receivable and loan balances on slide 9, you see that our growth momentum has brought our ending loan balances roughly back to pre-pandemic levels in this quarter. As I said at Investor Day, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, but is still below 2019 levels as pay down rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base. This liquidity and strength is also, of course, evident as you turn to credit and provision on slides 10 through 12, as we continue to see extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and in line with our expectations, but they did tick up a bit this quarter. As you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance, you will see that this quarter, we released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the pandemic, which lacked a comparable precedent. As we have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns, we have been able to reduce pandemic-driven reserves. While there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment, we believe that our CECL models are better able to capture our expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required. Our strong credit performance combined with the adjustment to our reserves drove a $33 million provision expense benefit for the first quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the net reserve release as shown on slide 11. As you see on slide 12, we ended the first quarter with $3.1 billion of reserves, representing 3.3% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our card member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen. Going forward, as loan balances, especially the interest-bearing portion of loan balances, build more meaningfully, we expect delinquency and loss rates to continue to slowly move up over time, but remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. We would also expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, although there could be some quarterly volatility in reserve adjustments throughout the year. As we move to revenue on slide 13, I do need to explain some changes we've made to our revenue reporting before moving on to results. As a reminder, we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those who are we play more of a network role. For added transparency, we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of discount revenue, other fees and commissions, other revenue and combined them into a newly created line called Processed Revenue, which you can then match up against our processed volumes. We have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one line named Service Fees and Other Revenue with the largest components of this line item being service fees earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business; and foreign currency-related revenues, such as FX conversion fees. This revenue line was up strong with 42% growth year-over-year in the first quarter, as you will see on the next slide. This growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel-related revenues. And as I said at Investor Day, we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this year. You will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release. A description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our Form 10-Q. With these changes out of the way, let's move to our actual revenue performance beginning on slide 14. Total revenues were up 29% year-over-year in the first quarter with broad-based revenue growth across all lines. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on slide 15. This growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued recovery of T&E spending. Net card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth reaccelerating versus the 10% to 11% growth rate seen in 2021 as you can see on slide 16. As I said at Investor Day, this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractive of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards with acquisitions of US consumer and US business Platinum Card members reaching record high, as Steve noted earlier, demonstrating great demand for our products, especially our premium fee-based products. Moving on to net interest income. On slide 17, you will see that it surpassed 2019 levels for the first time this quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense, in part due to our increased mix of deposits, which is generally our lowest cost funding source, particularly in today's rising rate environment. First quarter year-over-year net interest income growth of 20%, while very strong, remains slower than the growth in our lending AR, as revolving loan balances continue to rebuild and so we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022. To sum up, on revenues on slide 18, we're tracking well against our expectations. And looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% for the full year of 2022. So all of the revenue momentum, we just discussed, was driven by the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, the strong spending growth and customer engagement that Steve discussed earlier is driving the growth in these expenses lines. In total, these costs came in at 41% of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to right around 42% of total revenues for the full year. On the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the first quarter, on track with our expectation to spend around $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions, as I talked about earlier. And more importantly, about the revenues from those acquisitions, which is trending significantly higher than what we saw pre-pandemic. We continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities, even beyond those we are currently funding. Moving to the bottom of slide 19. Operating expenses were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, tracking with our expectation to spend a bit over to $12 billion for the full year. While OpEx was up 26% year-over-year this quarter, it is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of $384 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year, including in the OpEx line. I would point out that, what I said earlier that, inflation is having some modest positive impact on volumes, it is also putting some pressure on our operating expenses, but we'll have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full year. In any event, I still expect to have far less growth in OpEx compared to revenues and see these costs as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital, on slide 20, we returned $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and $394 million in common stock dividends, on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the first quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on slide 21, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 18% to 20% and earnings share between $9.25 and $9.65. We continue to expect the amount of our volumes, revenues and core earnings to sequentially strengthen throughout the year, driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds. As I mentioned earlier, clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment. As we sit here today, despite that uncertainty, the combination of our investments, successful execution of our strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and build growth momentum. We remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\nVivian Zhou: Thank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Alan?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go ahead please.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Obviously, the T&E rebound is happening at a brisk pace despite some of these lingering concerns on COVID cases, economic weakness. Jeff, you mentioned large corporate also that recently saw a strong rebound recently. Could you talk about how much of the volume rebound is being driven by unit demand versus sort of inflationary pressures? And how worried are you or your corporate clients about some of these issues like supply chain constraints and the economic concerns? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri : So let me start and Jeff can maybe add some color as well. But this is not being driven by inflation, try and book a flight. So that's not inflation. Now that doesn't mean that the airline prices are not a little bit higher. But not just for T&E, but just for the overall business, transactions are up. We had billings up 35%. That's not sort of driven all by inflation. We don't have 35% of inflation. But -- as far as travel goes, you have to realize, people have not been traveling for probably two years. There's a tremendous pent-up demand for travel. I mean our bookings, just from a consumer perspective, on a global basis were up about 38% -- 37%. In the U.S., they were up 48%. That's not over last year. That's over 2019. So people are looking to get out there and travel. And I think that's what's driving us. That is not -- it is not inflation driven when we look at that T&E number. The other thing I think is important with the T&E number, 121% is a great number, but also let's put it in context. Is 121% over last year, it's not 121% over 2019. So we're not all the way back. Consumers back, but we're not all the way back. As far as large corporations go, and we're seeing it in our own company, people are looking to get out and not only gather with their own colleagues, but they're also looking to get out and meet with customers. You're seeing conferences come back and so forth. And so I know in our own company, we are getting together as a senior management team, our top 100, 150 people. We have some sales meetings that are going on because people have not seen each other, as well as you're seeing customers opening up their offices. And I think as far as COVID affecting all of this, I think we are starting to learn to live with this. The reality is COVID is not something I think we've all learned that is going away. We'll wind up dealing with this as we deal with the flu, as we deal with [Indiscernible], as we deal with other viruses, people will continue to get have colds and get sick and off will go. But I think the world is opening back up at this point, and people are excited to go out and see the world again, both from a business perspective and from a consumer perspective.\nJeff Campbell: The only thing I would briefly add, Sanjay, is when you think about travel and entertainment spend, some of that increase is not so much inflation as it is a return to people buying more front of airplane or high-end hotel or high-end restaurant oriented. Some of that is the business travel rebound where your average business travel purchase is, of course, much higher than the average consumer purchase. The other comment I'd make going forward is there's certainly lots of uncertainty in the world. But when you look at everything we see in our actual results and business, you just can't really see any sign of weakness that that's causing as of today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Go ahead please.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning Steve and Jeff.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning Mihir.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you for taking my question. A lot has changed since guidance was initially set. And I am curious if you could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have been evolving since they were established? Are there areas that made sense to lean into now versus what you had thought coming into the year versus maybe pulling back in others? Like I guess I'm just trying to understand the flexibility in the model, particularly on the expense side in terms of as things change, what's changing under the hood even as you maintain guidance? Maybe just give us a flavor of that? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah. I think as far as flexibility, I think we demonstrated we have tremendous flexibility during the pandemic, especially as that related to our marketing expenditures. And, obviously, as consumers and business travelers didn't use cost -- our card member services, you saw flexibility there. So that -- so those things we do have some control over. But as far as the plan and the guidance that we have, we feel really comfortable where we are from a $9.25 to $9.65. But more importantly, I think we feel comfortable on what we are doing day by day to make sure that we are in line with tracking what our 2024 growth aspirations, which is a sustainable 10% revenue and mid-teens EPS. And that's how we're running the company. As far as what we see under the hood, we see, as Jeff mentioned, a range of good investment opportunities and you have to understand, when we see investment opportunities from a card acquisition perspective, they are here today and gone tomorrow. So if you don't act on them, you don't get them. And so we will continue to drive value, shareholder value by continuing to invest in the business and to grow the business for the medium to the long term. And that's been a strategy that's worked for us, and that is going to be how we're going to run it. But right now, if I was to look at the beginning of the year versus now, I probably see better investment opportunities today than I did with the plan. But as we know, those investment opportunities, they pay back over time. And what they do is they set us up better for 2023 and for 2024. So we feel really good about the guidance. We feel really good about the underlying investments that we're making and we'll continue to make.\nJeff Campbell: The only sort of simple financial summary, I put to that here \u2013 when we gave the guidance for our revenue ambitions are quite ambitious, we feel really good about the momentum we built, but we have more investment opportunities, as I said in my remarks, than we probably anticipated, and maybe a little bit of pressure on costs from inflation. So all of those things, I think, position us really well to build momentum towards our long-term target of sustainable over 10% revenue growth.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning. Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: So given the expected Fed moves to cool the economy and tame inflation, what degree of slowing in network volumes or build business volumes, let's go with do you incorporate in your outlook? And then on the T&E side, I know you indicated, it's up nicely and continues in April. How do you view this trend being as the Fed tightens and the economy cools through the year?\nSteve Squeri: The general comment, I would make, John, as you know, we don't have in-house economists. So we tend to say, we should run the economy and run our guide to run the business, run our guidance based on the macroeconomic consensus, which is not for there to be a recession, and the Fed will say that, they are certainly focused on bringing inflation down without causing a recession. So that's what's built into our guidance, and that's how we're running the company. I think as Steve pointed out earlier, we have clearly demonstrated over the last couple of years, our ability to manage the company in a very agile way and react to a scenario that's different than what I just described. But in terms of our base level of planning, I don't think it's our role to second guess that general macroeconomic consensus.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Betsy.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the loan growth and the card fee growth. As you indicated, the loan growth is \u2013 still has room to run. So maybe \u2013 and as well the impact on the NII. So maybe you could help us understand, is it the NII that's likely to accelerate here, but loan growth will be stabilizing, or how are you thinking about that? And also how it relates to the card fees, which I noticed were up nicely in the quarter? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Well, card fees are up because we continue to acquire more cards, and we're continuing to acquire. And I think we acquired 68% of the consumer cards we acquired were fee-based cards, which is still slightly below where we were, I think, pre-pandemic. So what is \u2013 what is important to understand is our card -- the majority of our card fee growth comes from new cards that we acquire. So, it doesn't just come from the fee increase, but we've also had a fee increase, which will come in over time. So, we feel really good about where we are from a card fee perspective. Let me just make one comment on sort of our overall loan growth, and then Jeff can get into the details. But the reality is pre-pandemic, we were growing slightly faster than the industry. We tend to have a lower share of our card members loan wallets than we do have their spending wallet. And our intent is to grow judiciously, but we will probably hope to get back to growing and -- we are growing fast we are growing faster than the industry, but to get our balances back up. But I'll let Jeff comment on the rest.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I just emphasize financial location, Steve, of what you just said, which is we are now that growing those lending balances faster than the industry, and we absolutely expect that to continue. So, there's a lot of runway for growth on the lending side. And because of quarters like we just had with a record level of new US platinum and Gold Cards on the consumer side and a record level of US business Platinums, I'd expect net car fee growth to probably accelerate even further from where it is.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Hi. So, you've clearly navigated the pandemic exceptionally well and your acceleration in investment spending couldn't have been better timed, as evidenced by your customer acquisition growth. But as you look ahead from here, I wanted to follow-up on some of your earlier comments. Are you at all concerned over the risk that the Fed may be forced to actually push the economy into recession to payment inflation? Does that give you any pause to be growing aggressively into that? I mean everything looks great now, but just would love to hear your thoughts a bit more on how about that risk? And maybe if you could help us understand how you think the Amex customer base would perform in that kind of environment?\nSteve Squeri: Well, as I said earlier, we are always, in terms of our guidance, planning for macroeconomic consensus, as while also making sure we're thinking about other possibilities. And certainly, Bill, is just one example. We are doing work today and making adjustments on the risk management side as we think about what the impact is of sustained levels of inflation at its current level on different aspects of our customer base because we want to make sure we're positioned from a risk perspective for that. Although that is not the macroeconomic consensus. years, again, our ability to be agile and manage through a downturn, should that happen. And we're trying to strike all those same balances right now.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Mark DeVries with Barclays. Go ahead please.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Steve, I think in your prepared comments, you alluded to both the new partnership with Vanguard and also some really strong activity out of resi. Could you just help us think through how kind of those two initiatives will really impact the topline?\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think the way you got to think about both of these is we are constantly and continuously adding more benefits and more services to the card. When you look at both of those partnerships, they onto themselves, they do not have top line growth. What they do, do though is they, in our mind, drive more engagement, drive more retention and give people more reason to want to be with the card. Now I'll just talk about resi for a second. Resi is not only a vehicle for giving our card members access to restaurant reservations and card members do get access to the global dining program, but it's also a card acquisition vehicle as well, because resi is an open platform. And so, resi was all about where our card members spend their money and how we can integrate more with restaurants and connect our card members and really take advantage of our closed loop in a different way, not just for payments, but the reservation piece and then, which leads to payments. And so, when you look at the partnerships that we have, that are sort of around the core of the card. And I'm not talking about the Delta co-brand partnerships and so forth. But when you look at the other things that we do add on, what we're constantly adding to our products are more services, better access, more experiences and so forth, so that you continue to build the value propositions in different and more sustainable ways. And Vanguard is an example of offering an investment service opportunity for card members that want to take advantage of it that combines Vanguard's digital adviser service, with the personal adviser service and puts an NMR component into it. And so, we'll continue to look at other lifestyle, financial and travel and entertainment services that just add to the overall underlying value of our card products.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jeff.\nSteve Squeri: Hey, Ryan.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: So, Steve, maybe a question for both of you. So, Steve, you talked about the investment opportunities looking better, and then, Jeff, you talked about the potential to build reserves. So I'm assuming you're talking about reserve dollars. And do you think we're at the bottom on the reserve rate? And also, despite recession fears, credit continues to outperform expectations. And if we do continue to see better credit, Steve, how are you thinking about the potential to lean further into opportunities to continue to acquire cards and move towards your aspirational targets for 2024 [ph]\nSteve Squeri: Well, let me answer questions one and three, Jeff can answer two. So -- if I remember one and three. But, look, the reality is that, we continue to see good opportunities. And as those opportunities continue to arise, we'll continue to invest in them. What's important to know is that, well, when we make an investment, we're making those investments through the cycle. So as we underwrite ROIs -- as we underwrite and we look at ROIs, we feel good about what we see. Now why those opportunities presenting themselves? Well, I think for a couple of reasons. Number one, I think the premium card space has been expanding. I think, especially as you think about Gen Zs coming into the workforce. I think about Millennials, which are getting a little bit older now, but Millennials who are still gravitating to the product. So the opportunities have risen I think because the pool for our product has been getting bigger and bigger. And we've talked about this in the past. When we used to look at people coming into our franchise, we used to start them off on fee-free cards. Well, a lot of our fee-free cards are probably not as differentiated as some of the others. And we have better service, and so forth. But when you look at the value of the products or the fee product, the fee products that we're offering, a smart consumer and a smart small business person can really generate a lot more value out of those products than they're paying for the card. And as you know, with our value propositions, given our partner network, we work with our partners to provide value to our card members, and it all works out for all three of us, the Card Member, the partner and for us. I think the other thing that's important, and you've seen a growth in small business acquisition as well is more and more small businesses are forming, and that's one of the structural shifts that we are taking advantage of. And to get to the third question and Jeff can get to the second question, which if he remembers it at this point. But to get to your third one, will we take -- if credit continues to perform better, we release more reserves, will we take advantage of opportunities. We will continue to take advantage of those opportunities as they present themselves. As I said, we're running this for the medium to long-term and it really is irresponsible in my opinion, of me to pass up really good investment opportunities that will pay off over the longer-term. I think one of the things that you've seen this year is, look, we're committing to 18% to 20% revenue growth off of a -- basically off of a 2019 revenue base. And you've never seen that from us before. And that is a direct result of us investing in our card members, investing in our brand and not walking away from good investment opportunities.\nJeff Campbell: Ryan, to come back on the credit side, maybe just to clarify my remarks. So when you look at the credit reserves, we closed the first quarter with. I would expect the dollar level of those reserves to be higher by the time we get to the end of the year, because I very much expect our AR balances to grow. Whether the reserve rate grows is much less clear, and it's probably more going to be a function of where economic forecasts go. Could the reserve rate go lower? Well, I don't think our delinquencies and write-offs are going to go lower. So the only thing just mechanically that could cause the reserve rates to go down. It would be a dramatic improvement in the balanced economic outlook, which probably would mean all the uncertainties in the world go away. So if magically, that were to happen, I suppose it's mechanically possible to reserve rank lower, but I would have to say that's pretty unlikely sitting here.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Meng Jiao with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nMeng Jiao: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Meng.\nMeng Jiao: On the competitive environment, I mean we've seen a competitor coming with the new Fab offering and the premium travel space is always top. But that doesn't seem to be stopping you guys much, if at all. I'm just wondering, can you quantify sort of the market share that you guys have taken? And also speak to any potential headwinds you're keeping the eye on in the landscape currently? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Well, I mean, look, we -- this is a competitive space. When you're talking about U.S. consumer, it's a competitive space. It's always been a competitive space. And it will continue to be a competitive space. And you've got Capital One out there with the new product and JPMorgan, all terrific companies that are looking to double down on the premium side of it, and we'll continue to -- again, going back to what I said when we -- the question was asked about resi and Vanguard and so forth, we're going to continue to add value to the products and making sure that we are still top of mind and top of wallet. And that -- look, we had record acquisitions. However, it's still a competitive space. When you think about competition, though, we just don't think about competition in the US Consumer, we also think about it in the US small business, and which is competitive as well. And you can go market by market by market, both from a small business perspective. And so there is a lot of competition out there. We keep our eye on the competition, and our objective is to continue to understand what our customer needs are, understand where our customer needs are going and continue to develop our products and services. And the reality is, you just don't -- you don't launch a product and then go to sleep for a few years and then say, okay, in three years, we'll come up with a new one. We're constantly adding value. And I think you saw that as we added more value to the Platinum Card even after the refresh when we put the Walmart Plus benefit on. So we always assume high competition, and we always assume that the competition is really good. And that has served us well, having that mindset on running the business.\nJeff Campbell: The one thing, Steve, I'd add is I take people back to your discussion at Investor Day about what you call the virtual recycle, which is the faster we can continue to grow our premium customer base, the more we're all so successful in attracting partners who want access to that base and help fund and further improve the value proposition. And that's one of the most important ways we operate in a very competitive.\nSteve Squeri: No, that's a real good call out. And remember, that virtuous cycle sits on top of an actual network, right? Because where we get those partners from are from our network, our merchant network. And so you have this physical merchant network, and we're able to create that flywheel to drive more and more value, not only to card members but to partners and the more -- as Jeff said, the more cardholders you have and the more value our customers get it, the more they want to invest in that base.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\nChris Donat: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning Chris.\nChris Donat: I just wanted to -- yeah, hi. Just want to double check on the net card fees and the year-on-year growth there and the acceleration in the growth. So a bit of that being a function of new additions, but also fee changes. Should we expect a similar year-on-year trajectory for the next four quarters as you recognize some of that revenue over time, or is this a onetime kind of bump\u2026?\nSteve Squeri: No. So -- yes, it's good question, Chris. As I pointed out earlier, the -- and as I think I showed a chart at Investor Day, the majority of the growth in net card fees is driven by bringing more customers into the high fee-paying products, not by any particular price increase, although the price increases when we price for adding value to add a little bit. When you think about the rate at which we've been bringing new premium card members into the franchise, record first quarter for US Platinum Gold on the consumer side and business Platinum. That mechanically now just makes me pretty darn confident that as you look at the next few quarters, that 16% is likely to even further accelerate a little bit as we build on the acquisition momentum we have. Because as I think it sounds like you recall, the accounting for fees, you're amortizing of over 12 months from when they're paid. So there's a fairly predictable effect here.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.\nRick Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks and I appreciate you taking my question. I'd love to understand the really strong first quarter results in context of maintaining 2022 guidance in your previous comments about sequential build throughout the year. Obviously, there's going to be some normalization of provision expense, but I am wondering what this says about operating leverage and efficiency ratio given your accelerating top line?\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think that the very careful word that I inserted, Rick, when we talked about sequential growth was in what we're calling core earnings, which is why we included that pre-tax pre-provision net income number on the first page, because credit reserves are going to bounce over the place. Although in terms of dollars, I would credit reserves at the end of the year, assuming AR continues to grow as we expect to be a little bit higher. So I absolutely do expect pre-tax pre-provision net income to be a little bit stronger each quarter as you go through the year. I don't expect that necessarily of GAAP earnings per share because we just had really, we pulled forward in many ways, a good sized credit reserve release into Q1 that drove your GAAP EPS up to 270. Clearly, I do not expect sequential growth of that number, if you just do the simple math. That's pretty obvious given our EPS guidance. The other point, I'd come back to is we feel really good about the revenue momentum, but boy, Steve, I think, has made very clear our focus on pursuing good investment opportunities when they arise. And so we're very comfortable with the EPS guidance we've given for the year.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead please.\nLisa Ellis: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nSteve Squeri: Hi, Lisa.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the New Card acquisition with proprietary cards in force at $72.8 million. It was up 6% year-on-year. I was just peaking back at the model. We haven't seen a quarter up 6% since back in 2018. So can you just talk a little bit about what's driving that acceleration in card acquisition? And specifically, is that temporary like the return of the Delta co-brand growth, or is it more that you're just seeing a higher ROI on some of your card addition marketing spending?\nSteve Squeri: Yes. I mean, look, I think we are seeing a little bit of a higher ROI on our card acquisition spending. And as I \u2013 as we said, I think there's just there's an expanding pool. It's not just the consumer base, but it's also the small business base. I'll go back to my comments before. The millennial and Gen Z pool is expanding. There are more small businesses out there. And as we look at the opportunities, we were able to bring in probably more cards than we thought we were in the first quarter. And we see opportunities going forward. So we'll continue to invest to grow the card base. And \u2013 but remember, what we're looking at we're just not looking to grow in cards. I mean, these cards are hitting our return. You've got a large percentage of these cards are fee-paying cards. But I'll also go back to \u2013 I think it's either my comments or in the Jeff script, 60% of the cards that we did acquire from a consumer perspective were millennial cards, which are up 50 -- which is -- was 50% pre-pandemic. So, is a bigger pool for us to acquire from, from a millennial Gen Z perspective, and there are small businesses. So, right now, we feel good about card growth. How that translates next quarter. Look, the last few quarters, we've had sequential card growth quarter-to-quarter. And coming off last year, look, there wasn't a tremendous amount of card growth in the first quarter from a relative basis, on a comparative basis, but it continued to move up every single quarter. And we feel good about what happened this particular quarter. Can it be 6% again next quarter? I don't really know.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Yes. In SME, I noticed Capital One is marketing a no limit, small business card. I was just curious, I know that's part of your secret sauce. Obviously, if you thought that was material. And then lastly, on fintech Like, I know you have partnerships with Bill.com and Coupa. But do they represent a threat in any way to your business?\nSteve Squeri: So, just -- I'm sorry, just one other point. Just retention helps a lot. And our retention numbers, if you look at the last couple of years, have improved significantly. So, if you think about your base is having a leak in it, the leak got a lot smaller. So, that's -- I think that's important. Don, as far as fintechs go, I think there's some opportunities for us, and I think the partnership with I2C -- we already have a partnership with them in Latin America. And I think this will just make it easy to onboard fintechs that want to have American Express because the reality is a lot of them -- not a lot of most of them don't do their own processing, they'll partner with somebody else to do this. And having I2C and being able now to do this on a global basis will enable us to approach. I don't look at that as a necessarily a threat. I look at this as an opportunity for us. And what was the first part of your question, Don? Cap One, no limit. I don't know what no limit. I really don't know what no limit is. And so -- yes, I think what they've done is put out a no preset spending limit, but -- and I'm not being flipping here, I just don't know what that no preset spending limit is. So, we'll see how that plays out. Again, a really good company. It had lots and lots of success, very tough competitor. They're the first ones to go down this road, and we'll see how it all plays out, how it all plays out. But we take them very seriously as we take everybody else. Yes, it is part of our secret sauce and we'll see. So, again, just look at the results in the first quarter for us, we had 30% growth from a small business perspective. So, we feel pretty good about small business at this point.\nJeff Campbell: And a record quarter for business Platinum --\nSteve Squeri: Acquisition, yes.\nVivian Zhou: Great.

After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 2023 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered record revenues of $61 billion for the year, up 15% on an FX adjusted basis, and we had a record net income of over $8 billion, with earnings per share of $11.21. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong customer engagement and demand for our premium products. We had solid growth in billings, strong new account acquisitions, and continued strength in credit quality, which remains the best in the industry. As a result, we achieved fourth quarter revenues of nearly $16 billion, which was another quarterly record, and EPS was $2.62. Christophe will provide detail on our quarterly results, but I would like to take a step back to talk about what we've accomplished over the last two years until you -- why I'm feeling good about where we are today and why I'm confident in our future. Coming out of the COVID pandemic in January of 2022, we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, and we set in aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving prior to the pandemic. At that time, we laid out our growth plan with the objective of positioning the company to be able to deliver on our aspiration of driving annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth over the long-term. In executing the plan, we focused on listening to our customers and understanding their needs, and we invested in innovating our value propositions, as well as uplifting our marketing and technology capabilities and backing our colleagues to meet those needs. Looking back over the two years since we announced the growth plan, I'm pleased to say that we achieved what we set out to do and in fact, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on our journey, thanks to the millions of premium customers we have around the world and the American Express colleagues, who support them. Today, we are a larger and stronger company. Since 2021, we've delivered record annual revenues, increasing the scale of our business by over 40% in just two years from $42 billion to $61 billion in annual revenues -- in revenues. Annual card spending over this period has increased 37% on an FX adjusted basis to a record $1.5 trillion. We've added about 25 million new proprietary card accounts over the last two years, and over 70% of these new accounts are coming into the franchise on fee-based products. With the growth and new accounts we've seen over the past few years, we now have a total of over 140 million cards running on our global network. Our focus on continuously innovating our value propositions to meet the needs of our customers is driving increased brand relevance across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers. These customers represent over 60% of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2023, and 75% of new consumer Platinum and Gold accounts acquired in the U.S. came from this cohort. At the same time, retention continues to be very high and our credit metrics remain strong and best-in-class. These strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments we've made in our business along with the tremendous earnings power of our business model. Looking ahead, let me tell you why I feel really good about our future prospects. We have a business model that is delivering premium performance, and we have strong momentum, which is driven by four key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are difficult to replicate. First, our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees, spending and best-in-class lending with our subscription-like card fees being a core and fast-growing component of our revenue mix. We have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions. Our premium customers are high-spending, loyal and drive our strong credit performance. We have a large and growing partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to card members and merchant partners around the world, and we have a global brand and a servicing ethos that truly sets us apart. Our business model provides us with strong competitive advantages, and the way we've been able to leverage the model's unique elements and execute our strategy has strengthened those advantages, giving us the runway for continuing our momentum across generations, geographies, and both our consumer and small-business customers. The power of our business model combined with the global scale of our premium customer base, the dedication and focus of our talented colleagues, and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see ahead are the key reasons why I'm confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan. And it's why going forward, we will remain focused on our long-term aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth. We believe this aspiration is the right one and we aim to achieve it every year. However, we manage the company for the long-term, and we anticipate there'll be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to a variety of factors such as external environment and actions we might take that we decide are best for the business. Looking at this year, the continued momentum we've seen in the business as we've executed our strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for 2024, which is in line with our long-term aspiration. For the year, we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between 9% and 11%, and full-year EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.70 a share, up from $0.60, beginning with the first quarter 2024 dividend declaration. This represents more than a 60% increase in the dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in January of 2022. As always, we will continue to run our business for long-term, and we'll do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through innovative, unique value propositions and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security, delivered and supported by a world-class colleague base. In keeping our focus on backing our customers and our colleagues, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long-term. Thank you. And let me now turn it over to Christophe.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 2023 results, which reflect another strong year of performance and to lay out our expectations for 2024. I will discuss both our quarterly and full-year results this morning. Since this year end and since looking at our business on an annual basis, it's more in sync with how we run the company. Starting with our summary financials on slide two. Full-year revenues reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion, up 15% on an FX adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported full-year net income of $8.4 billion, and earnings per share of $11.21. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 billion, and earnings per share of $2.62. Let's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results, beginning with billed business on slide three. We reached record levels of spending for both the full-year and the fourth quarter in 2023. Total billed business grew 9% versus last year on an FX adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, billed business grew 6% as we continue to see more stable growth rates after lapping the prior year impact of Omicron back in the first quarter. This 6% growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter, but I would point out that the number of transactions from our card members continues to grow double-digits year-over-year, a good indicator of the engagement of our customer base. Our growth was driven by 5% growth in business services spending, and although slower than last quarter, continued strong growth in travel and entertainment spending up 9% for the quarter. Restaurant spending remains our largest T&E category and reached $100 billion for the full-year for the first time, while airline spending growth slowed in the quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses, starting with our largest segment on slide four. U.S. consumer grew billings at 7% this quarter. We continue to see growth across all generations and age cohorts with millennials and Gen Z customers again driving our highest billed business growth within this segment. Their spending was up 15% this quarter. Looking at commercial services on slide five, overall growth came in at 1% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate. Spending growth from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers remained modest given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Specifically, in 2022, we saw a large increase in organic spending as businesses restocked their inventories following supply-chain issues during the pandemic. This caused a significant grow over challenged spending from this segment in the industry in 2023. Importantly, we continued to see strong levels of demand for new accounts, high levels of retention, and strong credit performance on our small-business products. Looking ahead, this positions us well for the future, a spending growth rebalance. And lastly, on slide six, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services. We continue to see double-digit growth across all regions and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, each grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Overall, while we're seeing a softer spend environment, we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our card members across the globe. As we think about 2024, we are assuming a spend environment similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. Now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide seven. We saw a year-over-year growth of 13%. We expect this growth, which has been elevated versus pre-pandemic levels to continue to moderate as we progress through the 2024, but to still grow modestly faster than billings. Turning next to credit and provision on slide eight through 10. First and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices, and our disciplined growth strategy. As we had expected, our write-off and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter, as you see on slide right. Going forward, we expect to see this delinquency and write-off rates remains strong with modest increases in 2024. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide nine. The modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth loan balances resulted in a $400 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.4 billion of provision expense in the fourth quarter. As you see on slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $5.4 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our total loans and card member receivables and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our card member base. This reserve rate remains about 10 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day-one CECL. We continue to expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to revenue on slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full-year on an FX adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 5% year-over-year in Q4, and 9% for the full-year, as you can see on slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full-year, as you can see on slide 13. As we expected, growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In 2024, we expect to exit the year with some further momentum compared to the current growth supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium value propositions. We currently have plans to refresh around 40 products globally next year. In the quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards, and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new cardmembers continue to look strong. Moving on to slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in Q4, and 33% for the full-year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year. When you think about 2024, you should expect to see net interest income growth moderate as balance growth moderates, with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers continuing to rebuild balances. And I would remind you that for our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from the lower interest-rate environment next year. To sum up, revenues on slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum. Looking forward into 2024, we expect to see revenue growth between 9% and 11%. Moving to expenses on slide 16. Overall, total expenses were up 5% in the fourth quarter and 10% on a full-year basis, both growing significantly lower than revenue. This expense growth reflects the strong growth we're seeing in our business, the investments we've made, as well as our continued focus on expense discipline. Starting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses. These costs came in at 40% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full-year. I would note that this cost came in a bit lower than our expectations, reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model. As T&E spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter, we saw lower rewards cuts than we had expected. For example, a lower mix of redemptions for airline's tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend. In 2024, I would expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue, as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our card members. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full-year. This is a bit below last year and our expectations to have marketing spend at around $5.5 billion. Marketing expense came in lower than we expected for the quarter, reflecting lower demand given the softer T&E environment. However, we saw demand increase as we moved through the quarter and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in 2024. We are confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine will do so in an efficient way. Moving to the bottom of slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $14.9 billion for the full year 2023. This was above our original expectations, driven by a few notable items in the quarter. First, as part of the normal course of business, we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we continuously look to enhance the organization's effectiveness. We also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific merchant, and like many others, we were impacted by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which increased our OpEx in Q4 by $115 million. Looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage, and our focus on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. In 2024, we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this year's expense. We will of course continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed. Taking everything into account in 2024, we expect total expense to grow mid to high-level digits for the full-year, as we expect to drive continued leverage through our operating expenses. Turning next to capital on slide 17. We've returned $5.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023, including $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.5%, within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 2024, as Steve discussed, we expect to increase our dividend by over 15% to $0.70 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings, and our 20 to 25 target payout ratio. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach. That brings me to our long-term aspiration and 2024 guidance on slide 18. We continue to run our business with a focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of 10%, and mid-teens EPS growth, and we believe that is the right aspiration. As Steve discussed for the full-year 2024, specifically, we are reducing our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11%, and earnings per share of between $12.65 and $13.15. This guidance remains in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we're seeing in our business today. We also recently announced an agreement to sell our Accertify business. Our guidance and the items related to 2024 that I just walked through, do not include the potential impact from this sale. We do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business, as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open the call for your questions.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit themselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Did you say the '24 EPS guidance and rev guidance? I guess on January spend, some of your peers have noted a slowdown on weather. Can you comment on that, and then just maybe talk a little bit about billed business in '24 in terms of SME?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So we don't talk about monthly numbers so let alone about you know a few weeks into the month of January. So, I think best is to wait until the end of quarter, and we'll provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in January so far. As far as how we think about billed business in 2024, our planning assumption is that we should expect or we expecting billings to be consistent with what we've seen in the prior few quarters, you know, and we are ready to see in a society if there is some. But for now, that's the assumption we have baked in our plans and how we constructed this guidance. On the SME side, it's the same, assumption if you want. We are assuming either something similar to what we're seeing in Q3, Q4, and you know we are very focused on winning the recoveries with SMEs. As I've said in my remarks, these card members have been through a lot over the last two, three years, and we are focusing on providing the best experience, the best products. We are focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can and helping them grow their business. And we'll be ready when they're ready. Historically, this has been a volatile segment for us. You know, how dynamic these customer segments are and we play a critical role in that industry and we'll be ready when they're ready.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Maybe to build on Don's question. Can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue growth, so discount revenues, card fees, and Christophe, I know you said that NII should decelerate then. Are we assuming any sort of re-acceleration as we move through the year, particularly in areas like U.S. Consumer or SME? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. Hey, good morning, Ryan, and thank you for your question. So the building blocks of the revenue growth remain the same. At a fairly high-level, we expect billing and therefore discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. We expect card fees -- so Q4 is at 17%, full-year at 20%, we expect card fees to be a key contributor to growth going forward -- to remain a key contributor to growth going forward, and actually to exit Q4 at a higher level than where we are right now. And I gave you the context in my remarks, very much supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition, their product refresh and renewals that we are committed to execute on, and very strong retention rates, which we have experienced for many years now. And when it comes to the last either component of our revenue pool, net interest income, you should expect that growth rate to moderate very much driven by the fact that -- and you've seen the trend, I'm sure, Ryan, there you know asset growth and their lending growth rate has been moderating over the past quarters and we expect that moderation to continue. The very strong growth was a function of tenured card members rebuilding balances post-COVID, and you know at some stage we're going to reach there -- a more normal rate there and that will naturally drive NII new to a more moderate level of growth. I'm going to also mention that we believe that the interest-rate dynamic in what the Fed will design doesn't play a big role here in terms of what's going to happen to NII. And when you put all of this together and you can -- you know, we run multiple scenarios what if billing is a bit stronger, what if you know NII is a bit weaker, and we land in the same range of 9% to 11%. So that's very much how we think about that the revenue guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes. Thanks. I was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from, how much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older and gaining share there, and also whether you're seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer customers versus older.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Okay. So let me take loan growth first. The dynamic on loan growth has not changed, and for several quarters now it's also our philosophy and how we run the company. About 70% of their loan growth comes from tenured card members, and what we call tenured card members is card members who've been with us more than 12 months. And that's very much how we think about acquisition. We acquire card members. We develop relationships with them. Then we offer them -- you know, we cross-sell products, we increase alliance, we nurture those relationships, and we do that because we understand them better, we understand their spend patterns and they understand our products better as well. And that's the driver. There either we don't do much balanced transfers, if any at all, and we don't have promotional offers -- much promotional offers also. So it's very much growing with our tenured card members. And it's part of our strategy to contain if you on the credit risk and to control it. And when it comes to the credit profile of the new card members, we haven't changed our credit underwriting models, right? We still -- and we haven't changed as well our marketing channels and products. Well, we still skew towards positive selection in terms of credit profile. That has not changed and I need to say that there prospects that we bring in and become recent card members have very good credit profile.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you for taking my question, and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments about customer engagement spending outpacing revenue growth. Can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive customer engagement with elevated investment spending, while at the same time offsetting that margin pressure with operating expense leverage in other parts of the business? And I guess, you know, do you anticipate positive operating leverage on an aggregate basis with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and operating expense combined?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. There's a lot here. So let me first take you through customer engagement. The key things for us and you've heard us say this for years, right? We build premium products and we price for that value. You've heard say as well that over the last years, we -- the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products. That premiumization of the portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue to more platinum card members, we bring more variable customer engagement expenses you should expect to see. But at the same time, we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this. And we have a lot of innovation in that space. I'm going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us. We've recently introduced there pay with point option where you can actually go in the app or the website, select one specific transaction and pay with points. So we have that either constant innovation to try to delight the customers, make their life easier, and at the same time, create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point. And specifically in Q4, one of the driver of that efficiency or that variable cardmember engagement expense was the fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets, which is one of the most expensive cost per point that we have. That drove some efficiencies in that metric. We also saw as there are some softness in in some T&E categories, less point accelerators earned and that created as well some efficiencies there. The reason why I'm pointing that out is just to give you some example of some of the natural hedges that exist in our business model, where -- when you see a little bit of softness in the top line, that creates some savings as well in some expense lines. So you know, we guided there -- towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable cardmember engagement expenses, and we're going to keep monitoring that. But I feel good about that trend. And I think that, that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings. We've committed to containing OpEx, and as I've said, we expect 2024 offering up expenses to be you know about flat to where we are ending 2023. And marketing expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see based on the efficiencies that we create as well. The model works really well, as you can see, and I'm comfortable that the model is strong. And we are stress-testing that model running multiple scenarios and it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over time. And I would say risk-adjusted earnings because that powerful model why do we pay on variable card member engagement expenses comes back with a multiple on the credit line. We attract positive select -- we generate positive select. We attract premium card members who have a very strong credit profile, and I like paying for that as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Chris and Steve, just wanted to dig into the softer T&E trends a little bit. You know, it looks like you're seeing some softness, particularly in airline spend, you're seeing some slower point redemptions for tickets there. Just maybe give us some insight into what you're hearing and seeing from your card members on that front, and then just maybe in the quarter book, can you help us understand what you're kind of embedding in your expectations for T&E from here? I think in the past, you've talked about how the booking trends have been a pretty good indicator of what's to come. Maybe any comment on what you're seeing there?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So T&E, sequentially the growth rate came down. I need to point out though that is still up 9% year-over-year, so it's a pretty strong growth rate. In terms of airline spend, and if you heard, I'm sure the various airline, they all made comments about the bid of a softer demand. And since many of those customers are using an American Express card to pay for the airline ticket, we saw a similar trend. This being said, booking remains very strong on our TLS segment. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know there were strong. So I don't -- we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep you know seeing a lot of strength and you know the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations of new cards are very strong. And here card members decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past and we've seen in the -- that choppiness as well in the past. I don't worry. It's one data point. And for 2024, we haven't either communicated on exactly what assumptions we're making by category, but either, I'm not too worried. We have a card member base that loves traveling, and I'm sure they're going to keep traveling.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, you guys have alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going to go up or drift up in 2024. I'm curious if what's driving that. Presumably, it's a mix-shift between loans and card member receivables, but I'm wondering if, at any level, you're also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either -- some sort of shift there. Is it just a pure mix-shift as the loan portfolio grows faster than the card member receivables?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So thank you, Rick, for your question. This is very -- this is an important point, so I'm glad you're asking the question. The first thing I want to say is that, the absolute levels when you look at the delinquency rates or the write-off rates are very low in terms of our historical performance, and on the slide I put as well the pre-pandemic levels. The write-off rate is 2% in Q4. It was 2.2% pre-pandemic, right? So we're still below where we were pre-pandemic. So in absolute they\u2019re very low. Relative to our peers, , which I know you know well, they also very good. And I'm sure you noted that every competitor or peer reported their numbers and experienced the same tick, but at a higher magnitude. I would take up of 20 basis point is one of the lowest in the industry. So I feel good about where we are and I feel good about the trend. When it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio, the key driver behind this is that there's still some normalization going on here. We are moving from sub-1% write-off rate during the pandemic. As you all know on this call, this was not a sustainable level and these rates are normalizing and they are normalizing at a slow pace, and I like that, and the 2% is, again, a place where I feel comfortable from a credit standpoint. The other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of, you know, what kind of loan growth we are seeing. The biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are their pay overtime facility that we offered with our charged products and their co-brands cards. And so both those portfolio have very strong credit profile and better credit profile than what we call internally proprietary lending, which includes blue cash every day for instance. So if anything, the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards product that have a strong credit profile and high velocity. This being said, that normalization is happening and that's what's creating that little tick-up. And as I said in my comments, we're not quite done with that normalization, there's still a bit more to come in our minds, but not a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just ask on capital, is there any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about Basel end game? Obviously, your preliminary expectations of the proposal, at least, are that it would take you down to closer to 7%, but there is a lot of talk about that being softened, just how are you thinking about capital management, you obviously increase your dividend, but how are you thinking about buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes, so thank you for your question. So not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that we've been meeting with regulators, Steve met with regulators, I met with regulators as well. And what I can tell you is that they're listening, they're engaged, and I think they understand our comments. The ball is back in their camp now and they're incorporating all the comments they receive from the industry and I'm sure you've seen a lot of those comments as well. So they have a lot of work to do. Right now we're in waiting mode. And I think we're expecting the current estimate is we're expecting their -- or at least their next version of the rules by the end of 2024, we'll see. It took 10-years to get to their first draft, so we'll see when we get the next version. I'm not too concerned. I feel good about our starting point and our capital position. As you know, we generate about 30% return on equity, which means that we generate a ton of capital. And for now, we're not going to change our capital policy. The first thing we do is of course fund the balance sheet then we distribute dividends We feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year. And the rest is going to go in share buyback so that we keep capital between 10% and 11% of our risk weighted asset. And that's what we've done for years, that's what we're going to keep doing. And we're going adapt to the Basel rule. You know we're running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over the 7% rate that we have. And so nothing has changed much on that front, so more to come when we get the final rules.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And many of my questions have been asked and answered, but hoping to follow up on a comment that you have just made about the pay overtime business. Could you talk a little bit more about the characteristics of that? You mentioned that obviously, that's going to tenured charge card customers. So the quality is very strong. Just talk a little bit about the yield and how much you've seen in kind of growth from that product.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So your description is correct, Moshe. It's a facility that we attached to our charge card products where they can decide if they want to revolve proportion of their bill. This is the fastest growing category for us in terms of loan growth. It was very well received by the card members. And I don't know what else I can I can tell you. Remember that their charge card has a no preset limits, which is an important feature here. So it's a way for us to give them as well -- and it's a painful product so it's a way for us to give them a facility, where they can revolve over a period of time. And as I've said previously, their credit profile is very strong on this product, very much because it is attached to a very premium base, right? And Premium Gold card members are using this facility and revolving from time to time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Maybe I could ask the questions regarding what's embedded in the revenue growth expectations for 2024 differently. If we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate, would that sort of target as to the low end of the guidance range? And then Christophe, you mentioned that lower rates shouldn't help, but aren't you guys liability-sensitive on the charge card portfolio? Thanks.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So let me take the second question first. We are slightly liability sensitive, and the key assumptions for us -- but the common remains that you know in its totality, our total balance sheet and total funding stack level, the impact of rate cuts is going to be very small to our NII. The big unknown here is what's going to happen to the beta. We've been as an industry trending around 0.7 on the way up. We probably got a trend to 0.7 on the way down, but not immediately, and it's hard to say exactly at this point in time where are we going to be when the Fed starts cutting rates. We are making assumptions with that we think are conservatives, but we don't know for sure and we'll see where we are. So there is a bit of uncertainty here, but what is -- what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact on NII depending on the rate curve. Going back to your first question around revenue, I just -- I don't have a lot to say on top of what I said earlier and what I've said in my prepared remarks. I'm happy to be surprised on the upside if billed business is stronger and card fees, we have good visibility. NII, I think the trend is very established. And on billing, as I said, we are assuming at this point in time something consistent with what we've seen in the previous quarters and we'll see where we are at the end of the year. But if the economy re-bounce, if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by economists and our card members are optimistic and keep spending, you know, I'd be delighted to have a higher billed business to report.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, good morning, Steve and Christophe. Thanks so much for taking my question. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the total card growth. We all know that you've seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of years so I was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cards-in-force growth, in particular this quarter. If there is any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards? Anything on that would be excellent. Thanks so much.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So we have about 140 million cards that can transact on our network. Out of the 140 million cards, about 80 million are issued by American Express. That's what we call the proprietary cards. They represent the bulk of the spend and they drive the very vast majority of our economics. And from a growth rate standpoint, if you look at cards-in-force and it's -- you know, you'll see that in the details of our disclosures, the proprietary cards-in-force of 5% year-over-year, and the total cards-in-force, so including their cards issued by network partners is up 6%. Does it answer your question?\nDominick Gabriele: Very much. I really appreciate that. Have a good day.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. And maybe I was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next Platinum refresh in the US. I think the last one on 2021. And whether or not you have any plan to do that this year, and if that's your guidance for the year as well.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So as you know, we have committed to refreshing 40 products this year, as Christophe has said, and strategically, we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of three to four year basis. And it's important because it's really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh. We're listening to our customers and putting in those enhancements and the extra value that they want and enable us to make sure from a generational perspective, we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change. As far as specifically for the Platinum card, we don't really pre-announce that, and so I think you just have to wait and see.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. And two quick questions. Considering the strength of Delta Air Lines over the last number of years, it's consistently the top airline. You've clearly, benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and likely in spend as they've been able to hold fares better. As we see airlines spend slow, does that benefit diminish, and is it something you have to think about? And second, in terms of small business, no, we've been pretty flat now for a couple of quarters. Curious what you're seeing under the covers there is this. Are you still able to issue new cards, or -- and are you seeing any reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline? I'm just trying to understand the move better small business owners. Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So from a small business perspective, the drive is really organic spend. We're not seeing existing small businesses spend more than they spent the year before. And that's not an American Express phenomenon. That is an industry phenomenon. As far as card acquisition within small businesses, that still remains strong. As far as small businesses, looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth, that remains strong and the credit quality remains strong. I think as Christophe said in his remarks, there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup, some interest-rate shock and so forth, and so small businesses tend to be very, very secular. I would be much more concerned if we weren't acquiring cards, if we weren't engaging in new small businesses, or if write-offs and delinquencies were higher. So at the moment as we look at this, we truly believe this is an organic spending issue and it's not American Express-specific. I'll let Christophe talk a little bit about Delta.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we are originating a lot of new cards as well. And my comment about there either softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip, time will tell, but it's still growing very, very strong and the engagement with the partner is very strong -- the partnership is going strong. So I don't see any softness there at all. And I will say as well that their credit quality of those new card members remained very strong. I made comments about, it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side and it comes with very strong performance. People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So I'm not worried about that at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings growth a little bit. Maybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new card members versus winning wallet share? And then just related to that same topic was just how are you thinking about the environment for new card acquisition? Is this 3 million level that you have been out for the last couple of quarters, the right level to think about for the next year? I understand that is dynamic and you will change, but what have you assumed in your planning?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. Let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers. We go out and we look at acquiring card members who really focus on acquiring billed business and we acquire revenue. And consistently now, if you take the first quarter out of last year where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of 3.4 million cards, we've been around that 3 million to 2.9 million cards. And we will -- as long as we have line-of-sight into high credit quality premium cardmembers, we will continue to be out there aggressively acquiring cardmembers, and that range will be where we see that range today, between 2.9 million, 3.1 million. And we don't really provide any guidance on that, but with the amount of money we're planning on spending, I think that's a -- it's a pretty fair assumption. And we report that but what we're really focused on is making sure that we're getting you know billed business acquired. When you look at the composition, obviously, in a stronger environment, you really looking for more organic growth from your existing cardholders. And I just made the comment, before we are small businesses that's not what we're seeing. And so when you look at any growth that you're seeing from a small-business perspective that is truly from new cardholders acquired. And a lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders acquired which actually as we think about engaging with our cardholders gives me a lot of confidence going forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share, but as our cardmembers get back to where they were probably before the third quarter and fourth quarter, we believe there is upside there from a billings perspective. We've talked a lot about millennials over time, and we get on this growth trend -- we get on this trajectory with these millennials and Gen Zers, where we start with a higher share of wallet, and we start with that higher share of wallet because they are used to using their American Express card everywhere, and as they move through their lifecycles, their wallets increase. And so we have a lot of confidence in the long-term lifetime value of the millennial base and of the Gen Z base that we're now acquiring. And you see and even in this fourth quarter that is 32% now of our total spending. So when to think about this right now is -- a lot of the growth is coming -- that you're seeing is coming from new card acquisition, but there will be an inorganic step up as the economy gets better. So -- and that gives us a lot of confidence of how we're positioned for future growth over the long-term, which gives us confidence to say aspiration-ally we should be a 10% plus revenue company. And that's why you see the guidance that we've given this year, both from a revenue perspective and EPS perspective.\nKartik Ramachandran: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

Welcome to the American Express Q3 2023 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thank you, Kerri. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Q3 was our seventh consecutive quarter of strong performance, continuing in the momentum we've built over the last few years and aligned with the growth plan we announced in 2022. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues which reached $15.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $3.30 was also a new quarterly record. Based on our performance to date, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full year revenue growth and EPS growth that is consistent with the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And we are well positioned as we seek to achieve our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady state macro environment. My confidence is based on several factors, including the many attractive opportunities available to us because of the businesses and geographies we operate in, our unique membership model, which powers a virtuous cycle of growth, the success of the strategic investments we've been making in key areas of our business, and our ability to leverage our differentiated business model, which includes our premium global customer base, integrated payments platform, strong partner relationships, and trusted brand. Together, these factors have driven our strong performance over the past two years, including the continued momentum we saw in the third quarter. In the quarter, card member spending remained strong, up 7% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Spending was strongest in our US consumer segment, up 9%, and International Card Services segment up 15% on an FX adjusted basis. And US small business spending increased slightly from a year ago. Millennials and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest growing portion of our card member base, with spending from this demographic in the US up 18% year-over-year, and they accounted for more than 60% of all new consumer account acquisitions globally in the quarter. Demand for our products remain robust, particularly for fee-based products, which represented more than 70% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. Customers continue to be highly satisfied with our products and services, which drives high levels of engagement and retention. We were rated the number one US credit card company for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for the fourth consecutive year and the 13th time in 17 years of the study. And our credit metrics remain best-in-class as we continue our focus on growing with discipline and a strong focus on risk management across the portfolio. A key reason for the momentum we're seeing is the investments we've been making in innovating our value propositions to deliver generational relevance across all age groups. Resy is a good example of some of the ways we're doing this. We acquired Resy and continue to invest in building out the platform because we know that dining is something that all generations of Card Members care about. We've seen that in our results as restaurants continued to be the largest and one of the fastest growing T&E categories in the third quarter. The number of Resy users, restaurants on the platform, and reservations booked all continue to grow significantly. In Q3, reservations on the platform set another quarterly record. Over the last few years, we've also ramped up the number of exclusive lifestyle experiences, sponsorships, and access to events we offer that appeal to our Card Members across generations and geographies and reinforce the unique value of membership. Our highly popular experiences cut across entertainment, sports, food, art, and fashion. They generate strong on-site engagement with our branded activities and offers, and they help drive interest among prospects. They also continue to attract world-class partners who work with us to add new ways for our Card Members and prospects to experience the power of Amex membership. Earlier this week, we announced our latest sponsorship, an exclusive multi-year agreement with Formula 1 to be the official payments partner of Formula 1 in the Americas. This sponsorship is our first new sports vertical in over 10 years, and it represents a great opportunity to build on the rapidly growing popularity of Formula 1 racing around the world. Another way we're delivering generational relevance is by regularly refreshing and adding value to our products on a global basis. These product enhancements are tailored to the interest and spending patterns of our customers of all age groups in each local market. So far this year, we've made enhancements to over 20 premium products across the company, some of the latest of which were refreshes of our Platinum Card products in Japan, our Business Gold Card in the US, and just yesterday, our Hilton co-branded consumer cards. These examples and many others like them are further enriching our membership model, which helps us attract new premium customers, drive retention and deepen engagement with current customers and add more merchants and partners who provide offers and experiences that deliver additional value. Looking ahead, I feel very good about where we are and where we're going. We'll continue our strategy of investing for growth and adding more differentiated value to our membership model to deliver generational relevance, while continuing to leverage the strengths of our business model, all of which gives us a competitive advantage. I'll now hand the call over to Christophe Le Caillec for additional detail on our quarterly results.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have my first earnings call be one where we discuss our continued strong momentum which is reflected in our record revenue and EPS in the third quarter. I would like to take a minute at the outset to share my perspective on the company as someone who has been here for a long time and through various business environments. The company is very focused on driving high levels of profitable revenue growth. The key enabler of that growth has been the discipline we use to deploy our resources. As a result, the underlying quality of our business is very strong, and I have confidence in the sustainability of the growth drivers that we are seeing. We have accelerated the pace of our revenue and EPS growth since before the pandemic. That acceleration is a direct result of the strategy that underpins our growth plan, which Steve described. In the quarter, that strategy has driven $27 billion more in billings versus last quarter. The company is also generating almost $2 billion more in revenue and about $600 million more in net income compared to a year ago. This demonstrates the earnings power of our business model. Now let's take a look at the details of this quarter's performance. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Third quarter revenues were $15.4 billion. They reach a record high for the sixth straight quarter and were up 13% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of $3.30, which grew 34% year-over-year. Let's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results. In our spend-centric business model, that begins with a look at bill business starting on Slide 3. Total billed business grew $27 billion this quarter versus last year, up 7% on an FX adjusted basis as we continue to see the more stable growth rates that we expected. This growth was driven by 6% growth in goods and services spending, consistent with last quarter's growth rate and sustained double digit growth in travel and entertainment spending. This double-digit T&E growth has been driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences with the restaurant spending, our largest category, up 13% this quarter. Total network volumes grew 6% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you look at these results, I'd note that we exited a small product last quarter that was reported in our process volumes. This is reflected in the Q3 growth rate and expect to see the impact of the year-over-year growth rate continue for the next few quarters until we lap this exit. As a reminder, process volume includes volumes from cards where we play more of a network role and from alternative payment solutions that we facilitate. The revenue associated with these volumes makes up a small portion of our total revenue, which you can see on Slide 11. As we then break down our spending trends across our businesses, there are a few other key points to take away. Starting with our larger segment on Slide 4. US consumer grew billings strongly at 9% this quarter. Our focus on attracting, engaging, and retaining our premium Card Members is driving growth across all generations and age cohorts. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending up 18% this quarter. Looking at commercial services on Slide 5, US SME growth came in at 2% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate. As Steve discussed on our Q2 call, organic growth in this segment has slowed given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Importantly, we do continue to see strong high-quality demand for new accounts within this segment. Looking forward, we focus on continuing to help SME clients run their businesses. Billings from our US large and global corporate customers were flat year-over-year. As we have said for many years, these customers are not a major growth driver for our business, but they remain an important foundation for the company's business model. And lastly, on Slide 6. You see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services. We saw strong growth across our geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, each grew 15%. Overall, strength in spending growth from our US consumers and Card Members outside of the US continues to see -- offset the softness with commercial services that we've been talking about for the past few quarters. Taking everything into account, our spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the full year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were generating pre-pandemic. Now, moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth of 15% as well as good continued sequential growth. As our customers continue to rebuild balances, the interest-bearing portion of our loans and receivables balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see. Importantly, over 70% of our revolving loan growth in the US continues to come from our tenured customers. As you then turn to credit and provision on Slide 8 through 10, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show in our best-in-class credit performance. As you can see on Slide 8, our Card Member loans and receivables, write-offs and delinquency rates both remain fairly flat to last quarter and below pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect this delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time and they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances, combined with a modest increase in our Card Member loans and receivables delinquency rate resulted in a $321 million reserve bill. This reserve bill, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the third quarter. As you see on Slide 10, we ended the third quarter with $5 billion of reserves, representing 2.7% of our total loans and Card Member receivables. This reserve rate remained about 20 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day one CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit in the balance of year, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues were up $1.8 billion or 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 7% year-over-year in Q3, as you can see on Slide 12, driven by spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 13. This growth remains very strong and is powered by the continued attractiveness to both new and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investment we've made in our premium value propositions. As we expected, growth moderated a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. This quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards. Importantly, the acquisition levels you see on Slide 13 remain consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. The spend, revenue, and credit profiles of our new Card Members continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. Moving on to Slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 33% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, driven mostly by the growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up revenues on Slide 15, we're seeing broad based revenue momentum across our diversified revenue lines. For 2023, we expect revenue growth to be within the range we communicated in January at around 15% growth for the full year. Moving to expenses on Slide 16, variable customer engagement expenses came in at 40% of total revenues in the third quarter. Therefore, I now expect these costs to run at around 42% of total revenues in the full year -- on the full year basis. Looking forward, we view this cost as a key driver of our momentum as we continue to innovate our value propositions to deepen engagement with our premium Card Members and to attract new ones as Steve discussed earlier. On the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the quarter. I still expect to have marketing spend of around $5.5 billion for the full year, fairly flat to our 2022 expense. We feel really good about the quality of our new card acquisitions, which I talked about earlier, and I continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities. Given this strong set of opportunities, I would expect to increase our marketing spend in the balance of this year and we're confident that our sophisticated acquisition engine will continue to do so in an efficient way. Moving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses which were $3.7 billion in the third quarter as we invest in critical areas such as our talented colleague base and technology. Taking this into account, we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion. Looking forward, we continue to view marketing and OpEx as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital on Slide 17. We returned $1.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter. This included common stock repurchase of $1.3 billion and $438 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. As you can see on Slide 17, we target a CET1 ratio between 10% to 11%. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%, which is well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%. As we think about the Basel III proposal, the RWA increase could consume the buffer above regulatory capital requirements if the proposal is adopted as written. Notably, we believe there are clear opportunities for improvements between the proposal and the final rule. In fact, the regulators themselves have posed questions about potential issues in applying these rules broadly and we are actively engaged in that dialogue. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance state growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach. That brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 18. As Steve and I discussed in our third quarter results -- our third quarter results, sorry, reflect a continuation of the strong momentum we've built over the last few years, evidenced by our performance across diversified revenue streams. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of around 15%, consistent with the revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. As I discussed before, we now expect variable Card Member engagement expenses to be around 42% of total revenues on a full year basis, modestly below our original expectation. On marketing, we still expect to spend around $5.5 billion for the full year. And lastly, we now expect our operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion this year, modestly above our original expectation as we invest in areas critical to our success. Taking everything together, our earnings per share guidance remains between $11.00 and $11.40. Looking forward, we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and meeting EPS growth in a steady-state macro environment. With that, we'll open up the call for your questions in a moment. A final point which relates to our investor relations teams here at American Express. Steve and I have decided to move Kerri Bernstein to the critical role of Corporate Treasurer. I'd like to thank Kerri for leading the IR function during a period of strong performance for the company. I'd then like to welcome Kartik Ramachandran, our new Head of Investor Relations. Kartik was most recently a key finance lead in our US consumer business and has had a number of finance positions over his 11 years with the company. Now, let me turn it back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Christophe, Kerri, Kartik. Steve, just a question. We hear a lot about the choppy macro backdrop and its impact on spending. I'm just curious if you've seen any changes, behavioral, over the past quarter that might make you more sanguine on the outlook, or do you feel like your customers are unfazed? And just on a related point, I know the Delta stuff, there's been a lot of headlines on the changes that Delta's made to the Medallion qualification process. I'm just curious if you've seen any impact. Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah, so thanks, Sanjay. Let me start with Delta first. I think, as Delta makes changes, we're in lockstep with them all the way. And, one of the great things about having Delta as a partner is they're a very customer-focused organization. And they made some changes. The team got some reaction and I think they made some other changes which I think will be -- and have been received in a very good fashion. But as far as spending or card acquisition, it has had zero impact. So we haven't seen anything from a card spending on Delta or from a card acquisition. In fact, Delta card spending year-over-year was up almost 20%. So we feel pretty good about that. As far as the US consumer, and let's just talk about the US consumer and international consumer, it's still strong. We had 9% US consumer spending, 6% growth on goods and services, 13% growth on T&E, and that continues to be very strong off a high base. And from an international perspective, we've seen 15% spending from an International Card Services perspective and strong both from a goods and services and a T&E perspective. And I think it's important that I'll remind everybody, our card base is a really small piece of the overall US economy. And one of the reasons we have such great credit metrics is we have a really high-quality Card Member. And so at this point in time, they have not been impacted by anything. But the other thing that I would say is, you probably had the same question at this time last year. And I probably gave you the same answer. And right now, look, we can only manage the business for what we're seeing in our business, which is still strong growth. And we use the Blue Chip economic forecast. And that calls for pretty much more of the same. So in a steady state macro environment, I feel really good about, delivering on our plan. As Christophe said, we are well positioned and as I said in my remarks, we're well positioned to continue to deliver on our growth plan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Christophe.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Look, as a follow up to Sanjay's question, obviously it was good to see the solid revenue growth, given the challenging economic backdrop. And you're still talking about double-digit revenue growth next year, but maybe just talk about some of the pieces or the drivers you expect to see given what's going on in billing's growth and are you leaning more into lending in order to drive this growth? And then just lastly, like, do we need to see billings to improve in order to be able to drive double digit revenue growth? Thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Well those are a lot of questions, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: I know. Try to put in one in there.\nSteve Squeri: You actually only asked one, you just put it in multiple parts. [Technical Difficulty] Yeah right. We'll leave that one alone. But when you look at our model, there are many ways for us to grow revenue. We grow revenue from a billing perspective, we grow revenue from a card fee perspective, and we do grow revenue from a lending perspective. The current revenue growth that we have, the current billings growth that we have, is in line with what our long-term growth aspirations are. So where we are from a billings growth perspective, we feel really good about that. From a fee perspective, and I like to point this out, is that the major driver of our fee revenue is actually new card acquisition. It's not raising fees, it's really new card acquisition. And we -- look, we've invested approximately $5.5 billion this year. We'll probably step that up next year. So we're very confident in our card acquisition as Christophe said, there are a lot of great opportunities out there for us. And from a lending perspective, and we've mentioned this multiple times, our book today, we believe, is better than our book was in 2019. And if our Card Members continue to lend responsibly, and our Card Members have various needs at various points in time, and I think it's that model, it's our three-legged stool of revenue, which will continue to provide confidence that we're going to be able to deliver double digit revenue growth next year.\nChristophe Le Caillec: And maybe, Ryan, I can add one point on the lending side. As Steve said, we have a premium customer base and we grow in lending of that premium customer base. 70% of the balances are coming from established Card Members that we know well. So, those Card Members we know revolve with competitors' products and historically we under-index on that. We capture a big share of their spend, a smaller share of that lending. And what we're doing here is just deepening the relationship with them and capturing a bigger share of their revolving needs.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBob Napoli: Thank you, and congratulations to everyone. Kerri, it's been great working with you and good luck. So question, Steve, on the SMB business. That's a really important business for you. It's only growing 2%. I think there are large opportunities there. But what is -- can you maybe give a little color on what's going on in SMB and your thoughts about SMB as we move into 2024?\nSteve Squeri: Yeah, I think this is probably the second quarter in a row it's been low growth. I think a lot of it -- a lot of our high growth was really driven by organic growth and we haven't seen as much organic growth from a small business perspective. I think from an acquisition perspective, we're still very happy about the opportunities that are out there. We're still happy about the lending opportunities that are out there. And I think small businesses went through a very interesting cycle over the last few years in terms of not having a lot of inventory and then stocking up on inventory. And so we're still very positive on small business, albeit the last two quarters were relatively slow, but we share your perspective that it's still a huge opportunity for us. And it's a big part of our business from a billings perspective. And to remind people, our small business footprint is across a variety of small businesses, whether it's restaurant and retail or professional services and construction and so forth. So we still feel good about it and I think that we'll see just when organic does come back but we're still very positive on small business.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks everybody for taking my question and congratulations, Kerri, we've really enjoyed working with you and Christophe. We are looking forward to more dialogue. I just have one question. There was a comment about raising the reserve rate modestly as we move forward. Obviously that's not a function of changing economic outlook because you don't know what that will be. I'm assuming it's a mix shift issue. Can you talk about that a little bit in terms of what components are shifting in the mix and the different reserve rates for those products?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah, yeah. So the trend -- there is like still a bit of normalization going on. So, if you look at our delinquency rates, they're fairly flat. If you squint a little bit, you're going to see a couple of basis points increase. And that's effectively what I meant when I said that you should expect that reserve rate to increase a little bit. There's still a little bit of normalization happening here, but as you know well, those delinquency rates and write-off rates are very strong relative to our historical performance and of course, relative to peers. So there's nothing that gives me concern in that comment. It's just to preempt a little bit what we are seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Hi, good morning. Christophe, on the Basel III endgame, has the message -- is the message still unchanged? I mean, it seems like that's a pretty big increase in RWAs and that maybe you might have to ultimately dial back the buybacks at some point. Just want to get your thoughts on that.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah, so this is, as you know, a complicated set of rules, like over a thousand pages. So let me try to summarize it for you and the way we are thinking about Basel III. I think the right starting point is to remind ourselves that, first, we generate a lot of capital ROE in the 30% range. The second element of the starting point is that although our regulatory capital is at 7%, CET1 at 7%, we actually operate with a target of 10% to 11% percent. So that's 300 to 400 basis point north of the regulatory level. And what I meant to say -- my comment was to say that that buffer could be consumed by the Basel III rules if they are adopted as currently drafted. Another way of saying the same thing is that our level of capital today is very healthy given those rules. I also need to highlight the fact that in the rules themselves, the regulators pause some questions about the applicability of these rules to businesses such as ours, and they reference the charge card, for instance, business. And as you know, over 75%, 78% of our revenue comes from fees, but those fees are stable, visible, such as card fees that we talked about a bit earlier. And we are actively engaged with the regulators to figure out what's the right thing to do here. So we'll see where we land. No one knows. But for now, I don't expect any change to our near-term capital management policies and practices.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeff Adelson: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus a little bit on the spend versus account growth dynamics. It looks like your average spending per card or account is flattening out and your account growth is finally slowing a little -- more flat sequentially this quarter, even as you continue to add 3 million new accounts or cards a quarter. And it came against the backdrop of your marketing a little bit lower this quarter, although it sounds like you're going to be leaning back in next quarter to hit that $5.5 billion. So I guess my question is, are you seeing something that's causing you to drive a little bit slower account growth here or is there anything going on with attrition or anything with Delta?\nSteve Squeri: No. I think, it comes down to timing. And what happens is quarters happen to cut off on particular days, and that's just the way it is. But no, we're committed to the $5.5 billion overall approximately of marketing. You saw a slight sequential drop. I think we went under the 3 million for the first time in a while. And we look at account growth as, or cards acquired from an overall revenue perspective, but we still see tremendous opportunities out there, which is why we've sort of signaled here, more than signaled, we said we're going to raise our marketing expense for next year as well. So, no, we're not seeing anything at all. That gives us pause. And we will continue to acquire those cards as long as those opportunities are out there. So you will see a higher level of marketing spending in the next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning, Steve and Christophe. Welcome to the call.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Good morning.\nBill Carcache: Can you share any initial thoughts on the open banking rule that the CFPB recently proposed? There's a view that open banking essentially forces banks to hand over the keys to their customer relationships. I was just hoping you could speak to any opportunities that may present for Amex. And then following up on the capital commentary, Christophe, there's a view that you could reduce your op risk if you treated your rewards expense as a contra revenue. Any thoughts on that would be great, thank you.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah, look as far as [Fed now] (ph), I think let's just go to the UK. UK's had open banking for 10 years or so and it's really had no impact on our business either positively or negatively. So I don't really see this as a -- as either a big threat or a big opportunity. And I think what I'd like to take you back, Bill, to is what product we're actually offering. We're offering a membership model product basically, which has lots of different components other than just commodity paying. And our product has so many more benefits from a security perspective, a fraud perspective, a dispute perspective than an open banking product would have. And so I really don't see this, a, as either an opportunity or as a threat to our business, either in the short term or in the long term. I will turn the other question over to Christophe.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So on Basel, Bill, there are various things that we're discussing with regulators. I don't think it would be useful to go through the list here this morning on the call. But you raise either an important element here, which is that nothing is really changing in our business, right? We're still doing the exact same thing. And so we need to figure out with regulators what the right level of capital here and not be dependent upon accounting treatment or anything like that. So, too early to discuss this in detail. When we have more clarity, we'll provide you with a ton of out of Basel III detail.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hi, good morning. Pleasure to meet everybody. And, Kerri, thanks so much for all the help. I was just curious on your card member rewards as a percentage of billed business. It stepped down quite nicely quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. I was just curious if you're seeing anything in particular on the utilization of rewards recently or any commentary around that. Thank you so much.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah. So, yes, and our total VCE, I called out, was lower this quarter at 40%. So as you know, variable card member engagement and rewards is the biggest number there. It's a very large expense base. So we're constantly looking at when we do product refreshes, when we launch products, we're looking at ways to make sure that these value proposition works best and we price for this. And there's always changes, there's always changes as well in terms of how the Card Members choose to redeem their points from one quarter to another. As you know, we are also adding constantly new redemption partners that change the mix in terms of their weighted average cost per point. So there\u2019s, at any point in time, a lot of variables that will impact that ratio. We are very focused on making sure that we have the right ratio versus revenue and we also have the right value proposition that would be compelling in the marketplace. So it's a little bit lower this quarter. I think we said 42% for the full year because we are seeing it's a bit better as well from a full year standpoint. It's still going to be an area of investments for us. It drives a lot of growth as well. That's one of the key reason why Card Members sign up for the cards and engage with it. And we're going to keep working on those value propositions and make sure that we have the right balance here.\nSteve Squeri: The only other point I'll add is that within our value propositions, because of our really premium card base, lots and lots of partners want to work with us and include benefits within our value propositions to reach our Card Members. And so, you know, when you look at the overall value proposition, it's just not rewards-based. It is partner-based, and there are different mechanisms from a funding perspective of how that all works out. So that's part and parcel of our value proposition as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. You continue to outperform on credit, at least very much relative to your peers and below pre-pandemic levels. What are your thoughts on net charge-offs heading into 2024? And maybe you could touch a little bit on how the season-end curves are happening for your recent vintages.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah, yeah. So we're not going to give you a lot of details about 2024 on this call. We plan to do that at the beginning of next year when we speak about 2024 guidance. But what I can tell you is that the starting point for us of our credit performance and all our credit decisions is the quality of the products and the fact that it attracts premium Card Members. That's the starting point, right? We have a very talented risk organization. We have a very disciplined execution of our risk decision, but it starts with the quality of the product and that's the key differentiator vis-a-vis our peers and that's what we are focused on. And as you know, we've said this many times on this call, if anything, we are focused even more on the premiumness of the portfolio. We are -- the new Card Members, because you're talking about the vintages, the new Card Members we're bringing in, 70% of those consumer Card Members are joining the franchise on a fee-paying product. That's a big statement to join the franchise. And so, that's what we used to start projecting out. There's still, as I've said before, there's still a little bit of either COVID noise and normalization going on, but we are very pleased with our credit performance that we're seeing. And as you pointed out, the gap versus competitors, if anything, is increasing further.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Mauer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Mauer: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats, Kerri and Kartik on your new roles. The net interest yield on card member loans saw a nice improvement in the quarter of 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter and were -- you're now above Q4 \u201819 and while I understand what rates are doing, the increase was pretty substantial this quarter, so I was -- versus prior quarter. So I was wondering how we should expect that to trend. And secondly, given your visibility due to the accounting treatment of card fees, how should we expect that to trend over the coming quarters considering it's decelerated for several quarters in a row? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah, yeah. So on the yield, the key thing here, there are many moving parts, right? There are, as you know, in terms of the funding, in terms of their pricing, in terms of their various vintages. But the key, the biggest element that is driving that small increase in the yield is the revolve rate. So the share, the revolving balances, the interest-bearing balances in our total loan balances is actually is increasing a little bit. And that's an outcome of our tenured Card Members rebuilding their balances, which is something we've called out for several quarters now. And I just want to point out again that most of that growth is coming from, most of that growth, i.e. 70%, is coming from tenured Card Members that we know well and we can underwrite well. So that's the key driver behind the yield improvement. When it comes to card fees, you're right. We have good visibility because we amortize those fees over 12 months. So we see that trend. So you should expect that trend to continue a little bit, i.e., the growth rate to moderate. As I said, a key driver to this is going to be the cycle of product refreshes. And it's also going to be a function of us investing more marketing dollars, bringing on more fee paying Card Members. And that dynamic is just going to play out. So you should expect in the next few quarters, a bit of a moderation there, but I need to call out that it's a moderation from a very high level and as we used to say on this call, even during the pandemic, that specific category was still growing so it's still going to grow strongly in double digits.\nSteve Squeri: Right. And if you go back to the pandemic, we were growing in the 10% to 11%. And so when you look at the outsized -- what's called the outsized growth rates that we had in Q3 and Q4 of 2022, you did -- you had not acquired cards in really in 2020. And so when you got to that amortization in the third and fourth quarter of 2021, it was lower. So the growth rate was a little bit higher as we got in there. But look, we're pretty happy with 19% growth rate over numbers that continue to get bigger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, squeezing me in here. Again, congratulations to Christophe, Kerri, and Kartik. I wanted to maybe switch from talking about the card products that the whole call has been talking about a little bit, and maybe just talk a little bit about the non-card products. I think other loans and receivables is now up over $10 billion in total now. It's obviously been an area where you've spent a lot of time investing in. Maybe just talk a little bit about that, both on the consumer and commercial side. Where are you seeing some of the strongest growth? How do you expect that to trend? How much is that contributing to interest yields, and et cetera? Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yeah, so let me sort of just hit from a strategic perspective of what we're trying to do and even at $10 billion it's still a relatively small piece. One of the things we try to do from a small business perspective is to make sure that we can provide a variety of working capital needs to our small business customers. And in that case, it can be non-card loans for working capital, it can be shorter term loans for up to two years or so forth. And I think part of that was the overall Kabbage acquisition that we did to be able to do that because what we wanted to do, and it goes along with what we did with sort of our checking account as well, is we wanted to make sure that we could provide for small businesses a host of products and services from having to check a transaction account, having a lending product, having a charge product, and then having working capital loans. And so I think that really fits in. But that's not the driver of growth for us in that segment. From a consumer perspective, what we've continued to try to do is to really grow our organic footprint with our consumers. And you can go back in history, it started as a charge card and then we put lending and then we put pay-over-time and plan it within the product and came up with a savings account and a debit product and also a small component of personal loans. And so, we've been judicious and careful about how we've gone about that. But I think it's an important add to make sure that our customers are not going to our competitors when they need products and services like that. So that's the sort of strategic sort of backdrop on why we have that.\nKerri Bernstein: Okay. And with that, we will bring the call to an end.

And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of strong performance since we announced the growth plan in January of 2023. Revenues of $15 billion grew 12% year-over-year and reached a record high for the fifth straight quarter. Earnings per share of $2.89 is also a quarterly record and is also up 12% over last year. Based on our performance through the first half, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of delivering revenue growth of 15% to 17% and EPS of $11 to $11.40. We also remain focused on achieving our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady state macroenvironment. I continue to feel very good about our ability to achieve these long-term aspirations, let me tell you why. As I've said on previous calls and at investor conferences, we have a business model that's differentiated from others in the industry, which gives us some important advantages. Our business model is built largely around a fee-based premium -- our fee-based premium products, which drive our spend centric economics and produce a fast growing stream of subscription like revenues. Spending is the largest contributor of revenues, while lending plays a more modest role in our model. This revenue mix is a key differentiator for us. It all starts with our premium customer base, which is built on our trusted brand. We have a global scale that's unmatched in the industry and leadership positions with a diverse range of high-quality customers. We build long-term relationships through our unique membership model, which we constantly evolve to attract new customers and grow with them over time. Our high spending Card Members attract a wider and (ph) merchants and business partners, giving our customers importance and even more reasons to stay with us, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth. Partnerships play an important role in our model. We have a long history of partnering with brands who share our values of banking customers with world-class products and services and who value developing broad-based and long-term relationships with us. Hilton is one of those long-standing partnerships. Our relationship started 70 years ago, when we opened a travel office at a Hilton Hotel in Madrid, then grew into a merchant relationship after we began issuing cards. And then became our first co-brand partner in the \u201890s. The partnership has lasted and grown over time because we evolve together and put our customers at the center of what we do. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed a 10-year extension of our relationship with Hilton, which includes continuing as the exclusive co-brand issuer of Hilton consumer and small business cards in the United States, as well as extensions of our travel and merchant relationships. This extension builds on the strong foundation we've built over the years with Hilton and gives us a long runway to invest in products and services and [Technical Difficulty] that attract new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones. It's a great example of the strength of our business model and that it touches virtually all aspects of our business, providing our customers and our partner with exceptional value. Our philosophy of making continuous strategic investments in our business model, is what's driving our growth today, and it's the way we plan to run our business going forward. For our second quarter performance, the power of our differentiated model can be seen in our results. Card Member spending hit another all-time high in the quarter, with U.S. consumers and card members outside the U.S., both up by double-digits, which offset some softness in U.S. small business. Millennial and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest growing portion of our card member base with U.S. billings up 21% in the quarter. Of particular note, you'll recall that our International Card business was our fastest growing segment for several years prior to the pandemic and it's again the fastest growing. We continue to see strong growth in Travel and Entertainment spending, which increased by double-digits in the quarter and remains strong across customer categories and geographies. Q2 was a record quarter for restaurant reservations through our Resy platform and bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest levels since before the pandemic. We also saw continued strong demand for our premium products in the quarter. With over 70% of the new accounts we acquired on fee-based products and more than 60% of new customer accounts acquired globally are coming from Millennials and Gen Zs. While a number of new accounts is important, we pay particular attention to the quality and potential revenues they represent. And when you look at the accounts we've acquired over the last year compared to those we acquired over a comparable period pre-pandemic. The overall revenue being generated by these new accounts is up substantially over 2019. Importantly, we continue to be thoughtful about who we grow with and how. And you see that in our results. Our credit metrics remain best-in-class, supported by the premium nature of our customer base. Our robust risk management capabilities and the thoughtful underwriting actions we take on an ongoing basis that we've discussed with you on these calls over the last several quarters. Before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about our CFO transition. As we announced last month, Jeff will be stepping down as our CFO on August 14, at which time, our deputy Control, our Deputy CFO, Christophe Le Caillec will become CFO of the company. First, I want to recognize Jeff and thank him for his outstanding tenure as our CFO for the past decade. He's been an invaluable partner and friend to me and to American Express throughout his time at the company. Jeff's insights, strategic acumen and calm focused approach has helped us navigate through numerous challenges, including the unprecedented COVID pandemic, while strengthening the company's overall financial position and the flexibility of our business model. Jeff is a person of exceptional integrity and our company is stronger today because of him. While Jeff will officially be stepping down as CFO in mid-August, he'll be staying on as our Vice Chairman until next March, during which time he will be available to me, Christophe and our Executive Committee as we work on many of the important matters facing the company. Jeff, I speak for all of us at American Express when I say that it's truly been an honor and a pleasure working with you as our CFO these last 10 years. I also want to welcome Christophe, who has been a trusted partner to our leadership team and a key contributor to our company's growth for 25 years. As our Deputy CFO, Christophe works closely with our Executive Committee [Technical Difficulty] to drive our financial strategy and performance. Over his tenure, he has served in finance leadership roles across the company. Christophe has gained a deep knowledge of all aspects of our business and his experience and thoughtful analysis play a key role in our strategic decision making. I'm sure you all enjoy getting to know him. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jeff for his 85th earnings call as a public company CFO and his 41st and final call as the CFO of American Express.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflects steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Our second quarter revenues were $15.1 billion, reaching a record high for the fifth straight quarter, up 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.89, up 12% year-over-year. This does represent a quarterly EPS record for the company and it also reflects the sequential strengthening we expected as we move through the year that I mentioned last quarter. Pretax pre-provision income was $3.9 billion, up 33% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the strong growth momentum in our underlying earnings. So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which in our spend-centric business model always begins with a look at volumes, which you see on Slides 3 through 7. In total, you see on Slide 3 that we did reach a new record level for spending on our network this quarter, with total network volumes and billed business up 9% and 8% year-over-year, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis. Of course, I'd remind you that growth rates were particularly elevated last quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in the first quarter of the prior year. We are now seeing the more stable rates that we expect are more representative of the kind of growth rates we will see in the balance of the year. Goods and services spending grew 6% overall in the second quarter. We saw good growth in goods and services spending in U.S. consumer and International Card Services of 8% and 15%, respectively, while this growth rate in U.S. SME did continue to slow down a bit further from last quarter. In contrast, we saw very strong growth in Travel and Entertainment spending across geographies and customer types, up 14% overall driven by sustained demand for travel and dining experiences. Looking forward, I would expect this growth rate to remain in the double-digits through the rest of this year. Turning to our largest segment, U.S. consumer grew billing strongly at 10% this quarter. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment. with their spending growing 21% year-over-year. You see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services with strong growth across both geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumers grew 16%, while spending from international SME and large corporate customers grew 19%. The strength in spending growth from our [Technical Difficulty] consumers and Card Members outside the U.S. offset the continued softness in U.S. SME spending growth that we have been talking about for the past few quarters. Looking at Commercial Services, U.S. SME growth came in at 2% this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to monitor these spending trends. Our U.S. large and global corporate customers also grew billings 2% in the second quarter, as we've said for many years, these customers, while not a particular growth driver for our business to remain an important foundation for the company's business model. Taking all of this into account, spending volumes or tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic. Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8. We saw good continued sequential growth, as well as year-over-year growth of 15%. Year-over-year growth moderated a bit this quarter as we expected, but remains elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. The interest-bearing portion of our loan and receivable balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see as our customers continue to rebuild balances. Importantly, the majority of this revolving loan growth in the U.S. continues to come from our high credit quality existing customers. We also included a disclosure this quarter showing that only 8% (ph) of our U.S. Card Member loans and receivables comes from customers with a FICO less than 660. As you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, this high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates remained flat quarter-over-quarter while write-off rates continue to move up a bit this quarter as we expected, as you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances was the primary driver of our $327 million of reserve build. Although, there was also a small component from incorporating a slightly worse macroeconomic outlook this quarter relative to last quarter. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the second quarter. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $4.7 billion of reserves representing 2.6% of our total loans and Card Member receivables. This reserve remains about 30 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or Day 1 CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, while also reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 13% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 8% during (ph) Q2, as you can see on Slide 13, driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 14. Growth remains quite strong, and continues to be driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee paying products. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards and the spend, revenue and credit profiles of these acquisitions continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre pandemic. Importantly, the acquisition trends you see on Slide 14 in this and recent quarters are consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. Moving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up on revenues on Slide 16, we're seeing broad-based revenue growth across our revenue lines. We're tracking with our expectations. So looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth within our range of 15% to 17% for the full year of 2023. The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 42%, total revenues in the second quarter and are tracking with our expectation for them to run at around 43% of total revenues on a full year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.4 billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to have full year marketing spend of around $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow slower than revenues while continuing to drive the high quality [Technical Difficulty] Steve discussed earlier. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17, brings us to operating expenses which were $3.4 billion in the second quarter, also tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year. This quarter, you see that, as we expected, we have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth. And looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage. Turning next to capital on Slide 18. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock purchases of $1.1 billion and $446 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. Now as you know, this is an off-cycle year for Amex as a CCAR bank. Let me briefly remind you of our capital management approach. We generally increased our dividend roughly in line with earnings and target a 20% to 25% payout ratio. And you saw us do that as we increased our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share last quarter. We target a CET1 ratio between 10% and 11% and we ended the second quarter in the middle of that range at 10.6%. As we think about the potential finalization of Basel III, I'd remind you that our 10% to 11% CET1 target range is actually well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth and we don't expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach, driven by the evolution of these rules. So that then brings us to Slide 19 and the growth plan. To step back for a minute, I joined American Express 10 years ago in 2013 because I was excited about the long-term growth prospects for the company. Today, as I join you from my last earnings call, and actually even more excited about those growth prospects. Steve and I first introduced our new multiyear growth aspirations back in January of 2022. And I would point out to Christophe was in the room for every key decision we made as we developed that plan with the senior business leaders across Amex. Now in July of 2023, we have consistently achieved the aspirations we set out six quarters ago, thanks to the great efforts of our 77,000 colleagues across American Express. So we are reconfirming today, our 2023 full year revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth with EPS in the range of $11 to $11.40. Our revenue momentum and customer acquisition trends are positioning us well for our growth aspirations (ph) this year in 2024 and beyond. So this momentum, combined with this being my 85th consecutive earnings call across three industries without a break makes this a good time for me to transition the CFO role to Christophe. With that, I'll ask Christophe to say a few words before Steve and I take your questions.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to continue the strong legacy of performance that Steve and Jeff have delivered. I look forward to spending time with many of you on the call in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call over back to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Donna?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations Jeff. You've had quite a run at American Express. It's been very helpful throughout your tenure and I'm sure you will be in your remaining position. Christophe, I look forward to working with you. My first question is on billed business growth. Obviously, there's so much noise over the last couple of years and even in this year. And I'm just -- Jeff, you talked about stabilization going forward and expecting that. Could you just talk about what gives you the confidence that you see that stabilization because we're still a little bit above trend in terms of that growth and then what you need in the back half to get to that growth guidance on revenues?\nJeff Campbell: So gosh, I guess I don't particularly Sanjay see as above trend. What gives us confidence is looking at what has actually happened in our business over the course of this year. In the first quarter, you were clearly lapping Omicron. And that was, in some ways, I think, the last of the pandemic driven noise in our results. As you got into the second quarter, we have seen stabilization across geographies at a level that I would suggest is actually consistent with being in a pretty low growth economy. And what you're hearing from us is, with the kind of volume growth that you see this quarter, which we think has stabilized, which we think will continue, that is consistent with both the guidance we provided for this year as well as with our longer term growth aspirations. I would point out, at some point, the economy is likely to get stronger, but even with the economy in its current kind of low growth state, the volume growth that we're seeing now allows us to achieve what we have been committing to for six quarters.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. And look, I mean, just look at consumer, right? I mean consumer in the U.S. is up at 10%. T&E is still very, very strong. We talked about travel bookings, travel bookings more than one month out are higher than they've been pre-pandemic. They are higher than they were at this time last year. They were higher than they were, obviously, in 2019. International is really coming back strong for us. And as we said, it's a fastest growing part of our business. And the other thing I'll point out is you just had -- you had a little hangover of noise from Omicron in this quarter because last year, you had a little bit of spending that was pushed from the first quarter to the second quarter. And if you look at -- if you go back and look sequentially last year was a huge increase sequentially quarter-over-quarter. So we feel really good about. I mean it's hard to apologize for record billings. And as Jeff said, it\u2019s the billings we need to hit our growth plans. So we feel really good about it. And the other point I'll just reiterate again is that, look, we're in a low growth economy right now. We're still out there acquiring Card Members. Credit is really good. Our basis is changing in terms of more Millennials and Gen Z who will grow with us. And as the economy gets better, we expect the spending to pick up. So we feel really confident.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nJeff Campbell: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Nash: Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in the future and Christophe, I'm looking forward to working with you in the future. Maybe to drill down into two areas that were highlighted on the call. First, commercial, obviously, we've seen a big slowdown there to 2% year-over-year growth. Steve, maybe just talk about what's driving the slowdown and what do we need to see for a reacceleration? And maybe just drill a little bit further on T&E in terms of your confidence. Like it seems like sequentially, it may have slowed a little bit, but I think the point that year-over-year growth rates are still strong. So can you maybe just talk about what you see as the key drivers of that remaining in double-digits? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. I mean, from a T&E perspective, and I think you just have to listen to our friends at Delta and what Ed had said, I mean, they're seeing record growth. And for us, we're seeing -- as we have a line of sight to future bookings. And so when you look at sort of consumer T&E restaurant, not only is airline bookings up, but if you look at what's going on in restaurants in terms of Resy. I mean, restaurant is probably [Technical Difficulty] biggest segment that we have in T&E, because we have all other, but we'll wind up disaggregating that. Yeah, it grew 15%. And so we have really strong T&E growth and I think that people are just back traveling. And so the line of sight into what we see from Resy and the activity we see on Resy from a restaurant perspective, from the activity that we see in our consumer travel business, we feel really [Technical Difficulty] about that. As far as a small business and corporate, look, I think it's so about large corporate first. I think large corporate it's crawling its way back is the best way to describe it. It is a small piece of our business. It's about 5% of our business right now. It's an important piece of our business and we value all of the corporate relationships that we have. But as many of us know, the first step is to get people into the OS and then the second step is to get them out onto the road. And I think what you're seeing a little bit less of is those one as one-stop trips, that quick hop to London to meet with that one client or that quick sort of run across the country to have an internal meeting, you're seeing less of that. So I think that will continue to come back. We continue to be aggressive, obviously, at retaining those customers and aggressive acquiring new customers, but I think that's going to be slower. I don't think that's coming back as fast, which is a contrast consumer. As far as small business goes, I think when we look at small business, I think the biggest thing there from a small business perspective is really the organic growth. I think organic growth has slowed. I don't think that's an Amex phenomenon. I think that's a little bit of an industry phenomenon. And I think small businesses grew very, very rapidly. And I think they have slowed down. What we have focused in on from a small business perspective is making sure we're continuing to acquire more small business customers, continuing to meet the other needs that they have, which are some lending needs for existing customers and also their deposit needs. And so as we grow both aspects of those business, and as when they're ready to grow again, we'll be ready to grow judiciously with them and that's what we're focused on. So look, would we prefer that our SME business was growing like our consumer business, sure, we would, but there are these cycles. And at this particular point in time, I think you're seeing a little bit of an industry-wide slowdown from a small business perspective. But again, just to pick up on Jeff's point, from before, after the slowdown comes to recovery. So we'll be poised for that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nJeff Campbell: Hi, Besty.\nBetsy Graseck: And Jeff, all the best. It's been great working with you and Christophe looking forward to meeting you and working with you as well. I did just want to make sure I understood the guide on the Rev outlook here because what I'm hearing and tell me where I'm wrong. What I'm hearing is that, billings growth you're anticipating something similar to what you generated this quarter on a year-on-year basis for the second half of this year and that's a little bit of a slower pace obviously than the Rev guide of 15% to 17%. Clearly, 1Q was very strong, well above that. So I'm just trying to understand if the other lines in revenue are going to more than make up for that. i.e., net interest income. Maybe you could speak to that a little bit or some of the other fee lines that drive your outlook for the 15% to 17% for the full year Rev guide? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: So I think it's an important question, Betsy. But if you really just look at this quarter, the thing I would point out is you do have some unusual noise in the service fees and other revenue line when you look at our Slide 12 in the slide deck. Because in the prior year, we had a complicated litigation settlement that drove some unusual movement in that line. What we're really saying is that we are in a low growth economy, but we -- it is consistent with the objectives reset if you maintain the volume growth that we have, and then combine it with the kind of consistent high growth in net card fees that you've seen right through the pandemic grew 21% this quarter. If you combine it with the fact that you still have customers rebuilding balances a little bit on the net interest income side. And you take the noise out on the service fee and other revenue side, you then easily get to a number that is very consistent in the back half of the year with what we've guided for the full year.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. And I think he's a great example of the model, right? I mean, it's a great example of three legged stool. We've got card fee growth is very, very strong. I mean, it's the third -- I think it's the third straight quarter we've had a 20% card fee plus growth. Yeah, we're benefiting a little bit from net interest income. As Jeff said, there's noise in the services fee and other revenue, and that will shift. But yeah, we feel comfortable with billings around where we are today to make that revenue guidance because of the 3 tiers of the revenue that we have. So that's what gives us confidence.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Jeff. I often say this in these circumstances, a little bit tongue in cheek that we're going to miss you more than you're going to miss us, but I think that's absolutely true here. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years and Christophe, we're looking forward to getting to know you as well. I do, Betsy really pulled on the thread that I'm interested in pursuing as well, but would love to sort of think about this a little bit more. When we looked at the deceleration of top line in the second quarter, if revenue stays on that trajectory for the second half of the year, it sort of puts you at the low end of your top line guidance. It sounds like there's a little bit of noise that gives you some confidence, but I'm curious, fundamentally, do you think we will see some acceleration in the back half to sort of offset any potential risk if you just look at the trend line.\nStephen Squeri: We still feel really confident that we'll be within the 15% to 17%. And there's really not a lot more to say other than that. So yeah, you have a little -- as I said, you have a little bit of deceleration from a billings perspective. But it's a record quarter of billings, over $420 billion of billings. And so again, we feel very confident of the 15% to 17%, and we'll see where it winds up landing within that range, but the reason we give ranges.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRobert Napoli: Thank you. Thank you very much and Jeff, thank you for your help, and good luck to you. Christophe, welcome, look forward to meeting you. I would like to ask about your views on credit normalization, kind of a trend in credit normalization. What -- as you look at your portfolio, what we should expect as we look at the aspirations for 2024. So the -- I mean, the back half of '23 is pretty baked, but just as we think about that going into 2024 and onward.\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think the most important point to make there, Bob, is that we have a portfolio today that is more premium and stronger than what we had in 2019 and Day 1 CECL. That is why we added the additional disclosure this quarter around the small percentage of our portfolio that is in, so band (ph) where you do see challenges, and that's the FICO band below 660. So we feel very good about where we are from a credit perspective in this environment. I think we feel really good about the fact that when you look sequentially, you actually saw delinquencies flat. There is complexity in the CECL calculation when you try to do comparisons across companies. I did make the observation that the way and with the timing of how we do ours, we actually incorporated a slightly worse economic outlook this quarter than we did last quarter, sitting here on July 20. I think most people would say things have perhaps gotten a bit more optimistic in recent days. But we'll have to see how that influences things. At core, though, we feel really good about the product choices, the acquisition choices and the risk management choices we've made, which leave us confident that we will be below this year on credit metrics, all of the places we were in 2019. And absent some dramatic change in the economy, I think we feel good about what that means for 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Yeah. Good morning. Jeff, for meeting you in the middle of a nice storm till now. I appreciate all the help over the years and Christophe looking forward to meeting you soon. So my question -- my two questions really are around: one, SME just wanted to dig in a little further there. If you could help me understand if there was a meaningful difference in growth between the total number and if you just looked at it on a same business activity level and took out the new business adds. And second, has there been any real difference in credit vintages? We've recently seen some data on consumer loans that have shown a real deterioration in recent vintages of loans. So I wanted to ask about that. Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: So for the second question first, the answer is, no. It's really not big, Jeff, do you want to....\nJeff Campbell: Well, with the only color I'd remind you, over the course of the past year, Craig, we have talked about the fact that we have consistently made some adjustments from a risk management perspective. And I think that is part of why, as Steve says, don't see any change from an earnings perspective.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. As far as line of sight into SME, I mean, the way to think about it is organic is probably flat. You obviously have businesses that go out of business. And so you have a little bit of sort of same-stores that go away, but the acquisition is still relatively strong. So think about organic as having a neutral impact, think about attrition because attrition has a negative impact, but no different than what we've seen over the last few years and then acquisition in there. I think the biggest difference is really organic. And what you saw through the pandemic is, you saw a small businesses continue to add and add and add. And you got to remember, small businesses use a card to run their entire business. And so -- there was a lot of buying ahead from a goods and services perspective, from an inventory perspective. And so we're going to watch it really closely in terms of have they finally gotten to sort of full stock and what have you. And -- but I think that's the way to think about those three components: organic, basically flat and acquisition up and attrition pretty much stable.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hey. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. You guys highlighted that it is now six quarters since you introduced the structural increase in your long-term plan to double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. A lot has happened in the last six quarters. We're kind of finally returning to normal after the pandemic. So can you just highlight when you look at the underlying business drivers required to sustain that model on an ongoing basis, what is sort of doing better than you expected? Maybe where do you need to make some adjustments, et cetera.? Just kind of comment on how that strategy and your thoughts about that has evolved as you look forward now coming back into a more normalized economy? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. Well, I think you got to go back to sort of strategic priorities we always talk about, which is focused on premium consumer. We're focused on small business and we're focused on coverage. If I look at this, I would say that international has come back probably even a little quicker than we had thought within our three year horizon. I think millennials are playing out even better than what we had thought, both from an acquisition perspective and a spending perspective. I think when you think about boomers (ph), I think they've been slower to return, but it's just -- it becomes a smaller piece of our business over time. Corporate, I think that's an opportunity going forward from a growth perspective. And I think small business started out in the beginning -- in all business will wind up being sort of a tale of three cities over this time horizon. I think it was very, really strong for us last year. I think it's a little bit more muted, it's a little bit more muted. And I think it will probably pick up. And the other thing that's been difference it's been -- when we started with this plan, it was done in a much slower -- it was done with -- we anticipated a more robust economy. So what really makes us feel good about this is that we've accomplished this in a slow growth environment. We've stayed true to who we are from a credit quality perspective. And the last thing that I'll add is, I think we've made some really great coverage gains over this period of time as we continue to march to our goals, especially international, where I think the team has done a really good job from a coverage perspective. And when you think about our longer-term partnerships here, we've really cemented in our key partnerships over the long term here. Obviously, with Delta and with [Technical Difficulty] we still have Marriott and DA, which go out still a number of years. So we feel good about it. And the interesting part about this is, did it play out exactly as we thought it was going to play out? No. But the flexibility in the model has enabled it to go where we wanted it to go. And I think we really got off to a tremendous start in 2022 with tremendous revenue growth. I mean when we did this three year plan, we did not project 25% revenue growth last year. We were at 17% to 19%, I believe, when we started the year, then we took it up to 19% to 21%, and then you got 25%. So if you think about sort of where we thought we were going to be we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be longer term and the 15% to 17% guidance that we provided at the beginning of this year was based off original guidance that was 17% to 19%. So we're growing over bigger numbers. So, and that's why I feel really good about it. And so we'll continue. And I think the most important thing for us is to stay focused and to focus on our priorities. And I think the team has done a really good job of that. And you have to remember, and you guys all know this -- this is a very good industry to be in. And when you play in this industry the way we play in it, across three different dimensions of card fees of billings and of net interest income, it makes our model completely differentiated from our competitors.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\nArren Cyganovich: Thanks. Your marketing expense pulled back a bit this quarter. You still have high customer acquisitions. How are you thinking about marketing expenses going into the second half of the year and kind of quarter-to-date update in terms of your growth rates to build business?\nStephen Squeri: We're not going to do a quarter-to-date update on build business. We're kind of 20 days in. So there's no real change. But in terms of marketing, the only thing that's important to know is that we said we'd spend about $5.5 billion on marketing. That's our plan to continue to do that. How it winds up sort of moving from quarter-to-quarter, I think we're probably $100 million from last year or something like this -- in this particular quarter. But that all depends on the programs we're running and the timing and everything else. And so a week here, a week there, can make all the difference in the world sometimes when you think about when you think about spending $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion in a quarter, it's like $100 million sort of a week. So the bottom line is, we are committed to go after all the great opportunities that are out there and we believe that we'll wind up spending about $5.5 billion from a marketing perspective. And just to remind everybody that the marketing spend for us is predominantly customer acquisition, right? And affiliate fees and incentives and things like that, it's not sort of TV and print and it's kind of advertising. That's what that marketing spend is. And that's why it can vary a little bit from quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, great. Thanks so much for the question. So I was just wondering, when you think about your aspirational revenue target, has the thought process on the contribution to growth from net card fees to total revenue changed over time where it's potentially providing more of a boost towards that a 10% revenue goal versus the past versus discount revenue? Thanks, guys.\nStephen Squeri: No, look, I think one of the big differentiators for us is that card fee. I mean you think about that as, so the subscription SaaS kind of revenue and we're really pleased with that. But no, I mean, it's in the ballpark of what we what we thought it was going to be as we put together our aspirations, right? I mean -- and so when you look at this, the 20% three quarters in a row is a big number. And another thing I'd point out during the pandemic, it was growing in double-digits. And so -- which is -- it's a big contributor and it's obviously a high -- it has higher growth than discount revenue would, but it's pretty much in line with where we thought we were going to be.\nJeff Campbell: I just can't resist adding Dominick, for something that grew in double-digits all through the pandemic has had really high growth rates last year. It is going to continue to grow to be an ever bigger part of our revenue [indiscernible]. And I think that is a key strength of the company. It really ties customers and engages customers with us and the product and is a critical part of the overall model.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. And just one other thing, because Jeff, just sort of reminded me as he said that, when we talked about sort of this tenth plus year double-digit growth during the pandemic. It really speaks to how we think about our customers over the long term because if we had not invested in our customers during the pandemic, you would not have seen that double-digit growth during the pandemic or coming out of the pandemic. It was really important to embrace those customers. It would have been easier to drop more money to the bottom line rather than to put more money into our existing customers, but that's not how we run the company. And we were thinking much more from a long-term perspective. And by really investing in the value proposition because, as you all remember, those value propositions from a travel perspective were challenged best. And to put other things in there, it really helped us cement those relationships, which kept those fees going, but more important, drop just normal attrition that we had because we improved our retention rates over the course of the pandemic. So I think it speaks to the membership model because this card fee is a decision that our members make to join the franchise. And that's really important because that means they see value in the product. They see ongoing value in the product. And it's our job and we'll continue to do this to continue to insert more values into the product, and that's what keeps this thing going. And that's why from a strategic perspective, the consistent refreshing of our products is really, really important to our strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDon Fandetti: Yeah. Congratulations (ph) Jeff and Christophe. Jeff, I want to clarify on the Basel comments. Are you saying that you won't have to run at a higher CET1 than your target of 10% to 11%. I know there was some concern around fees being looked at differently. I wonder if you can clarify that?\nJeff Campbell: Don, you were cutting out a little bit, but I think you're asking about the CET1 target and Basel III. And the point I was trying to make is you need to remember a few things here. Our 10% to 11% CET1 target is actually more driven by our own (ph) view and rating agency views versus the regulatory constraints. Because our regulatory minimum has long been only 7%. That's the first point. The second point to remember is, we have a return on equity of over 30%. So our ability to quickly replenish capital whenever we need to without, frankly, taking more than a brief pause from share repurchase is very high. Third, I know there's been a lot of attention paid to different iterations of Basel, the Basel III end game, particularly around ops risk. I guess I'd also just remind people, ops risk is only one component. There are other components that probably have some positive and probably have some negative impacts on us. So I guess my -- but we'll have to see whenever the final rules come out. We've been waiting for them for actually like much of my tenure here. But they may come out hopefully later this month. And the devil is in the details here. But I think my overarching message is we don't see it as a material event for this company. Because it's certainly a possible outcome that there's no change in our target and even a modest change in our target with a 30% plus ROE is not going to have any material impact on share repurchase, or the trajectory of our EPS growth that we've laid out in the growth plan.\nOperator: Thank you. So our final question is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you for taking my questions and good morning. First off, congratulations, Jeff. Thank you for all your help and welcome, Christophe. I look forward to getting to know and working with you. I wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk about the process revenues of the network partnerships, I think the old GNS business. It seems like, there's been a little bit of momentum in terms of signing some new partners recently. I believe this quarter, we actually saw the launch of the Square Card and processed volumes grew faster than bill business this quarter. So just wondering if you could talk about that business a little bit more. Has there been something -- has something changed internally? Are you focused more on that segment? What's driving that momentum? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. No, I don't think anything has changed. I think these are -- it's always been something that we have been fooled (ph) on. But to switch or to get a partner to come on to the network is a big deal. And there are technical hurdles to wind up crossing. And we're -- the GNS team is out there on a consistent basis looking for new partners. And when you think about our overall model, we're really operating around 29 proprietary countries. All the rest of the markets that we operate around the world are GNS markets, either just from a card acceptance perspective or from a both a card acceptance and a card issuing perspective. And there's been a lot of work going on with GNS over the years to get to increasingly get more and more coverage. And so when you look at our improvements in coverage, so much of that's been driven by our GNS partners. And just to remind you that everything that we're doing in China really comes under the heading of GNS because we're in there just as a network. We don't acquire merchants. We don't issue cards. We have a joint venture and that's a that's a GNS relationship. And look, our launch of our card, I mean, with Square, that's been in the pipeline for a long time. But it's -- if you aren't in cards or if you're issuing Visa MasterCard, it's a little bit different to take up to our systems to get priority within your own system and so forth. And so we've been out there on a consistent basis, working to get partners. I think the Square One has a little bit more -- I guess a little bit more headlines because it's a U.S. partnership, but the team is out there on a real consistent basis all across Asia and South America and Africa and so forth, really thinking through how we continue to get more coverage and how we get more cards issued. So while you may see it a little bit more, I can tell you, the team has been working really hard at this for a lot of years.\nKerri Bernstein: Great. And with that, we will bring the call to an end.

After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Squeri: Thanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our first quarter earnings call. Back in January, we laid out our guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Our first quarter results are tracking to this full year guidance. Revenues were a record $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 22%, which is well above our full year expectations. Stronger spending growth outside the U.S. and in T&E offset some softness in U.S. small business spending. EPS came in a bit higher than our original plan expectation. Our plan calls for quarterly EPS to grow sequentially through the year as our revenue growth continues. Billed business was up 16% globally year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. T&E spending was up 39% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis due to the grow over effect \u2013 due to grow over benefit from the impact of the Omicron variant in last year's results. We saw strong demand across all T&E categories and customer types. Spending at restaurants continues to be a bright spot with growth accelerating to 28% on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year. In fact, March was a record month for reservations booked through our Resy platform. The platform now has more than 40 million users globally, an increase of 5 million in the last six months. Consumer travel demand also remains high with Q1 bookings through our consumer travel business reaching their highest levels since pre-pandemic. As you'll recall, we reorganized our international business last year, bringing together our consumer, small business and large corporate management teams outside the U.S. to increase agility, scale and efficiency and accelerate our growth. Our international issuing businesses were the fastest growing before the pandemic, and we're seeing a return to those trends. International Card Services billings continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 29% on an FX adjusted basis. Results were driven by robust growth in T&E spending, which increased 58% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. We also saw continued momentum in card acquisitions with 3.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Business Platinum and Delta co-brand account acquisitions all reached record levels. Notably, over 70% of the new accounts acquired globally in the quarter are on fee-based products. As we noted for some time, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are driving our growth in billings and acquisitions of premium fee-based products. More than 60% of consumer new accounts acquired globally came from Millennial and Gen Z. These customers also continue to contribute the highest growth in billed business among all age cohorts in the U.S., up 28% in the quarter. On credit, our metrics remain best-in-class, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk management capabilities and the thoughtful underwriting actions we've taken on an ongoing basis. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower growth and higher inflation economic environment. While the near-term economic outlook is mixed, our customers' spending and credit performance to date, along with the continued strong demand for our products from high-quality new customers, reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term aspirations. Our capital, funding and liquidity positions are strong and we continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertain [indiscernible]. As you know, we run our company for the long-term. We have a strategy in place to deal with swings in the economy, which has enabled us to be successful in navigating through the pandemic, the initial recovery period and the current environment of elevated inflation and higher interest rates. Through it all, we've continued to attract and retain high-quality customers and our strategic investments have resulted in the momentum we've seen throughout last year and into 2023. We feel good about the decisions we're making around growth, risk management and the economic environment. Our key metrics are strong. The market opportunities we see in our core businesses are plentiful. And our strategy of investing in value proposition innovations, customer acquisitions and global merchant coverage continues to drive our growth. Based on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering between 15% and 17% revenue growth and earnings per share of between $11 and $11.40. We remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of delivering sustainable revenue growth greater than 10% and mid-teens EPS growth as we get to a more steady-state macro environment. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Campbell: Well, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2, our first quarter revenues were $14.3 billion, reaching a record high for the fourth straight quarter, up 23% on an FX adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.40. Given we had a sizable credit reserve release of pandemic-driven reserves in the first quarter of last year; we've also included pretax pre-provision income as the supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pretax pre-provision income was $3.2 billion, up 20% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings. So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which in our spend-centric business model always begins with a look at volumes, which you see on Slides 3 through 7. Total network volumes and billed business were both up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX adjusted basis. Given that most of our spending categories have fully recovered versus pre-pandemic levels, we saw the more stable growth rates we expected this quarter with first quarter billed business growth of 16%, just above last quarter's growth of 15%. As Steve noted earlier, we did see particularly strong growth in travel and entertainment spending in Q1 of 39%, driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences. As expected, this growth rate was elevated early in the quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in January of the prior year. So I would expect to see growth moderate moving forward, but to remain high given the strong demand we are seeing across geographies, customer types and T&E categories. We also saw solid growth in goods and services spending for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. I would note that we did see this growth rate slow sequentially in the U.S. for both SME and consumer as we went through the quarter. So we are continuing to monitor these spending trends. That said, overall billed business reached a record level in the month of March, and our largest segment, U.S. Consumer, grew billings 16% in the first quarter, accelerating a bit above last quarter's growth. Millennial and Gen Z customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing 28% year-over-year this quarter. Turning to Commercial Services. We saw a year-over-year growth of 10% overall. U.S. SME growth came in at just 6% this quarter, but was somewhat offset by really good growth in U.S. large and global corporates, up 34% year-over-year. And lastly, you see our highest growth in International Card Services. We are seeing the early benefits of the organizational changes we announced last year start to play out demonstrated by strong growth across geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumer and international SME and large corporate customers, who were among our fastest-growing pre-pandemic, grew 27% and 34% year-over-year, respectively. International Card Services travel and entertainment growth was especially robust at 58% for the quarter. This segment is still in a recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments. Overall, our spending volumes are currently tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic. Now moving on to Loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8. We saw year-over-year growth of 25% in our loan balances as well as continued sequential growth. This growth continues to come mostly from our existing customers, who are rebuilding balances, and as a result, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances is growing faster than the 25% growth we see in total loans. Specifically, over 70% of this growth in the U.S. is coming from our existing customers. We are pleased with this growth and with the overall lending economics we are generating. That said, looking forward, you may see the growth rate of our loan balances moderate a bit as we progress through 2023, but we would expect it to remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. If you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our card member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, though they did continue to move up this quarter as we expected, which you can see on Slide 9. We view these consolidated write-off and delinquency rates as more comparable to pre-pandemic rates than the individual loans and receivable rates because, as we talked about last quarter, our charge products in many instances now have embedded lending functionality. Going forward, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10, the expected increases in delinquency rates combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances resulted in a $320 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.1 billion of provision expense in the first quarter as we moved past much of the volatility in this line item that CECIL reserve builds the releases caused during the pandemic. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of reserves representing 2.5% of our total loans and card member receivables. This reserve rate remains about 40 basis points and below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day one CECIL. We expect this reserve rate to continue to increase as we move through 2023, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels. Moving next to revenue on Slide 12, total revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the first quarter or 23% on an FX adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up 34% in the quarter, driven largely by the year-over-year increases in travel-related revenues that accompanied the tremendous demand we've seen for travel. As you can see on Slide 13, our largest [indiscernible] line discount revenue grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis, which similar to spending volumes, growth is just above last quarter\u2019s growth rate. Net card fee revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 14. Growth, which did moderate slightly this quarter as expected from the extremely high level we saw last quarter remains quite strong. This growth continues driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter, we acquired 3.4 million new cards demonstrating the demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products. Moving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 36% year-over-year, on a FX adjusted basis accelerating versus last quarter, primarily due to the growth in our revolving loan balances. I'd also note that net yield on our card member loans increased 50 basis points sequentially reaching pre-pandemic levels this quarter as our customers increase their revolving balances. We have been able to increase our net yield while maintaining net right off rates below pre-pandemic levels, expanding our net credit margin. To sum up on revenues, on Slide 16, we're tracking well against our expectations and looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth 15% to 17% for the full year of 2023. The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. Those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 43% of total revenues in the first quarter, tracking right with our expectation for them to run around 43% of total revenues on a full year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.3 billion in the quarter on track with our expectation to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to our full year 2022 expense, $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues as we did for many years prior to the pandemic. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the first quarter. There is usually some quarterly volatility in this number and this quarter, for example, we saw a $95 million impact from net mark-to-market losses on our Amex Ventures investment portfolio. But you can see based off our first quarter results that similar to marketing, we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year. We continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage. And moving forward expect to have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth. Turning next to capital on Slide 18, we ended the first quarter with our CET1 ratio at 10.6% with our target range of 10% to 11%. I would note that AOCI already flows through our regulatory capital today. So any unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio are fully reflected in the 10.6% that I just quoted. I would also point out that we hold only $4 billion of investment securities, most of which are short-dated U.S. treasuries. In the first quarter, we returned $600 million of capital to our shareholders. With our strong capital position, we have both the capacity and the intent to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we regenerate, while supporting our balance sheet growth. I'd also note that our liquidity position remains extremely strong as we ended the quarter with $41 billion of cash; our highest ever balance, excluding the pandemic period. We also saw a 10% increase in our deposits this quarter, including the inflows in the weeks following recent volatility in the banking sector. On Slide 25 of the appendix, we have provided a bit more detail on deposits than we typically do, if you'd like to look at some of the numbers. That brings me then to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 19. For the full year 2023, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 15% to 17% and earnings per share between $11 and $11.40. At this level, year-over-year revenue growth, we expect to see a significant, sequential increase in the amount of revenues as we go through the year. In contrast, our marketing and operating expenses were already more in line with the run rate for the year in the first quarter. There is always some quarter-to-quarter volatility. So the simple math then gets you to the sequential growth in our underlying earnings consistent with our full-year EPS guidance. There is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But as Steve discussed, our customers have remained resilient thus far in the phase of the slower growth, higher inflation economic environment. Our outlook is based on the blue-chip macroeconomic consensus, which continues to expect slowing growth, though not a significant recession. In any environment, though we are focused on running the company for the long term. Looking forward, we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth as we get to a more steady state environment. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\nKerri Bernstein: Thank you, Jeff. And before we open up the line for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I think, the number that's pretty striking is the strong growth among millennials and Gen Z, which seemed like a third of the U.S. spending volumes. I've heard some worry about like this cohort because they are relatively new to credit, but obviously it seems like the spending remains quite strong. So I'm just curious sort of how you are seeing things trend for them whether or not you feel like there is more risk or less risk. And then, maybe Jeff, you can collaborate a little bit more on the weaker spending trends that you saw in March. Thanks.\nSteve Squeri: Yes, I think, that well, Jeff can elaborate a little bit more, but March was a record spending month for us. Overall, it was the highest month we ever had in the history of the company. So feel free to elaborate on that, Jeff. But millennials have been a big part of our growth story, and if you go back pre-pandemic, they represented about 20% of our billings. Now they represent 30% of our billings, and they are growing at, I mean, last quarter they grew at 30%, this quarter they grew at 28%. And we're acquiring 60% of our new cards acquired. I think from risk perspective, they play out much like low tenure plays out. And so we really have not seen anything different with millennials than we have seen with any of our other card acquisitions. And so, like anything you need to watch, you watch that, but right now we don't have any concerns with that. And the other thing that I will point out is that this whole concept of getting more millennials really started with our focus on generational relevance and making sure that our products and services were attractive across an entire cohort. And so that is really working for us as you've seen the composition of our base change. And so that gives me a lot of confidence as we move forward that we're making the right moves from a value proposition perspective and continuing to invest in the right benefits, and we are acquiring the right customers. And as I have said on these calls before we continue to raise the bar in the phase of an uncertain economic environment, we continue to read the bar on who we are acquiring. The last point that I will make, because I think, it's really relevant, and stay with me on this for a second. If you go back to 2018 and look at all the cards that we acquired in 2018 and looked at what the first quarter spending was in 2019, and you did the same thing in 2022 and looked at what the first quarter spending was in 2023, we are 50% higher, meaning, we are acquiring higher spending card members. And so I think the teams have done a phenomenal job of really sort of getting through the quarter [ph] and getting not only more card members, but getting card members that spend, getting card members that are paying fees and getting card members that will be with us for a long time. So that\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a long sort of answer, but I think it\u2019s really is relevant to what you were talking about in terms of millennials because I think that gives you a pretty good picture of just how we are looking at that segment and just how that segment is performing and how we believe it will continue to perform. So you want to talk about March, Jeff?\nJeff Campbell: Well, the only thing I would add is, we\u2019re just trying to be transparent, Sanjay. I think a lot of people describe the current economic environment as mixed. And so March was our strongest month ever across the globe in terms of volumes as a company. In the U.S., spending customer types on Travel and Entertainment is really strong. But you did see in Goods and Services as you went from January to February to March, spending slow a little bit the growth rate sequentially. On the other hand, you\u2019ve also got to sort through how does Omicron last January, February fit into that. So, we\u2019re just trying to be transparent about sorting through all the mixed signals. But I think we come back to our customers overall have shown great resilience in the face of all the mixed signals in the economy, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re running the company on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mihir Bhatia, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi thank you for taking my questions. I was curious, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the slowdown that you\u2019ve seen, I think you mentioned in the U.S. a bit. Are there particular types of spending you\u2019re seeing? Is it broad-based across customers? And I think you mentioned both on the consumer and small business side. So if you could just elaborate on that. And if you have any data on April you can share.\nSteve Squeri: Well, on the consumer side, just look at sequentially, consumer in the fourth quarter grew 15%. We\u2019re growing 16%. So there was really no slowdown there. When you look at U.S. SME, we grew 8%, and we\u2019re growing 6% now. So, I think there was a little bit of a slowdown in U.S. SME. And remember, when you look at our consumer business, our consumer business, I don\u2019t believe is really representative of the entire economy. Our consumer business is representative of a really high-end premium consumer base. Our small business, because of the volumes that we have, are probably a little bit more representative. And where you are \u2013 where you do see a slowdown in small business is Goods and Services. What I\u2019ll remind people is small businesses are small businesses, because they\u2019re small. And what happens is to a level of spending, and then unless you \u2013 unless that business is really going to grow, you can only spend for what you\u2019re taking in. But I think what we\u2019ve seen, and this is a continuing trend is, you\u2019ve seen a slowdown in a lot of the advertising spending. But I will point out that, that\u2019s not any different than what you\u2019ve seen in \u2013 from a lot of corporations, I mean \u2013 and ours ourselves. I mean, if you look at it, our plan has been to spend the same amount of marketing that we spent last year this year, and that number is $5.5 billion. And when you look at that number, we try and get more and more efficient with that and we push our partners to become more and more efficient as well. And so you get to a point of scale where you just don\u2019t spend anymore. And I think we\u2019re seeing a little of that in small business as well. But look, 6% growth in the U.S. small business with the amount of volume that we have, right now we\u2019re okay with that and it\u2019s in line with us making our overall plan. What I would point out from a small business perspective is international is not like that. International is growing much, much faster than that, and international is back to our fastest growing segments. So, we\u2019ll keep watching it, but really happy with the consumer. And right now, I think small business is kind of in line with where we have it going for the rest of our plan for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yes, thanks. Just wanted to get into what drove the acceleration of growth in International Card Services. Jeff, I heard you alluded to the fact of seeing results from the reorg. But could you talk a little bit more specifically about kind of what you did in that business segment to really drive the improvement?\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think \u2013 so there\u2019s a couple of things, right? Number one, there was \u2013 no place in the world is more impacted by the pandemic than International. And when you look at our card base internationally, it is a really high T&E-orientated card base. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I think this is a 59% T&E increase in our international part. So that\u2019s number one. I mean, I think you just have \u2013 you have just some built-up demand that had been pushed down, number one. Number two, we continue to improve our merchant coverage tremendously in international. So there are more and more places to use the card. And I think coverage cannot be understated or overlooked in how it drives growth, especially in international. And I think that\u2019s really important. I think we continue to acquire new card members in international as well. And as far as the reorganization, what the reorganization does for us is it makes us a lot more efficient. And so let me give you an example. Sometimes it\u2019s really hard to determine whether a potential customer is a small business or whether a potential customer is a consumer. And what you do is you put resources in, you go against \u2013 you attack them both ways. Well, now what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re looking at that in a more holistic way. And so instead of having what I like to refer to as the Noah\u2019s Ark syndrome of two of everything, we now have someone in a market focused on card acquisition, both small business, consumer and international and large market and corporate as well. And so I think what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve been able to become more efficient with our marketing. We\u2019ve been able to share intellectual property across business lines. And we\u2019ve been able to, in a given market, make better trade-off decisions from an investment perspective because we\u2019re running it much more as a market as opposed to running it as global segments. And I think that\u2019s really giving the team a lot more flexibility and giving them a lot more ability to achieve their goals. So \u2013 and look, the reality is international is the fastest-growing part of our business pre-pandemic. And this was \u2013 these moves were made to become more efficient to get it back to where it was and go beyond that. And so we feel good about the start that international is on at the moment.\nJeff Campbell: Yes. The only comment I\u2019d add, Mark, is it is remarkable the breadth of the strength right now when you look across geographies. It\u2019s Europe, it\u2019s the UK, it\u2019s where we are in Latin America, it\u2019s Asia. It\u2019s really broad-based. So, we feel really good about the progress.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, I did want to just ask an overarching question on top-line growth drivers from here. And I know we have already spoken about a couple of different line items. I think U.S. and large corporate is still something we could unpack a little bit. But I would also like if you could just, from your vantage point, give us where you think the growth drivers are from here, which 1Q extremely strong? Thanks.\nJeff Campbell: Well, many senses [ph] Betsy, I would almost just point you to the first quarter results, because I think one of the drivers of our confidence is the breadth of strength we see across all the lines of the P&L. So discount revenues, when you look forward and look at growth, are going to look about like they did this quarter. I think you\u2019ll see a tail-down slightly, because you have a little bit of Omicron tailwind maybe in January and February. But volumes look good, and that\u2019s going to continue to be a nice double-digit driver of growth. We have grown net card fees in double digits consistently for year\u2019s right through every single quarter of the pandemic, and they\u2019ve been above 20% for the last couple of quarters. That\u2019s going to continue, because what we constantly have to remind people of is it\u2019s not particularly increases in fees for any given card to drive that, although it helps. It\u2019s mostly the steady acquisition that Steve talked about; more people are on higher fee-paying cards. Net interest income, as I said, I think our overall loan balance growth will probably continue to be higher than it was pre-pandemic, but moderate a bit as our customer\u2019s kind of get through the process of rebuilding balances. I think \u2013 I don\u2019t want to pretend to suggest I can predict exactly what interest rates through the rest of the year. That will have some impact on the growth rate. Although I\u2019d remind you, unlike most banks, we\u2019re \u2013 the impact of rates moving one way or another on us is very, very modest. We\u2019re reasonably hedged. There\u2019s a 10-K disclosure about that for anyone who\u2019s interested, but we\u2019re not that heavily impacted. And then you have the service fee and other revenue line, which is benefiting from travel-related strength. And I think that will continue. So, I think as you think about the drivers of revenue growth across the rest of the year, it doesn\u2019t look that different than what you saw in the first quarter. It\u2019s very broad-based, and that\u2019s what gives us confidence.\nSteve Squeri: Yes. So, I could just say what he said. But let me just take it up a level. And I think that one of the things that we do in looking for opportunities is we try and make sure we\u2019re investing in those opportunities, which have the greatest return. And Jeff said this many, many times on these calls, we have more good opportunities to invest in than we have dollars to invest. And I think nothing is a better example of how good our opportunities \u2013 how much better our opportunities have been come than what I \u2013 and how I answered the first question for Sanjay in talking about how the cards that we\u2019re acquiring now are 50% in this first quarter, anyway, 50% better than they were back in 2018. And the other thing that I would say, which I think is really important is when we looked at acquiring a customer and we report cards, but we look at acquiring revenue and when we look at a customer, revenue for us is a three-legged stool. We acquire card members and a majority 70% of the cards we're acquiring right now are paying fees. That's a huge differentiator for us. Then what we do, you pay that fee, you use the product and then as Jeff said, that discount revenue and at discount revenue is going to grow pretty much in line with where it was now. And then the third legged stool is interest income. And we've modified our products so that we have planted on it, we have pay over time, and so we're giving our customers lots and lots of choices in how they want to manage their financial lives with us and how they want to manage their credit card payments. And so we really focus a lot on revenue for our customers. And that's what gives us a lot of \u2013 that's what gives us a lot of confidence because when we acquire a customer it's not, okay, we're going to acquire [indiscernible] going to drive lending revenue. We're going to acquire this customer, and it's going to be fee. We literally look at that entire basket and as we look at the ROIs, all of that is taken into account.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRick Shane: Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I'd like to discuss the accounting and strategy on fee waivers. When fees are waived, I'm assuming that the fees are recognized and there's an offsetting expense in terms of marketing. Are both the fees and expenses accreted in amortized quarterly? Is that the way we should think about it?\nJeff Campbell: Well, I think, can I maybe step back, Rick? So when you, because in many ways I think sometimes there's a misnomer about when we have a line called marketing what's actually in the marketing line, right? So there are variety of incentives that we offer to customers and sometimes to partners acquire customers that are involved in bringing new card members into the franchise. And when you look at the $5.5 billion that we spend in marketing, there's a very small portion of that that is \u2013 ads that probably people talk about more. But the overwhelming majority of what's in that $5.5 million are the costs of the many kinds of incentives that we offer to customers. And so fee waivers can be incentive or interest rates on balances that are at promotional levels, but in general the cost of those welcome incentives are going to be amortized over varying periods, right? We offer lots of different kinds of marketing incentives, so I can't generalize to the exact period, but generally they're going to be amortized over a period. So one of the things we always wrestle with is when you look at it in total, as you're bringing more customers into the franchise, you generally are recognizing the cost of bringing them in more quickly than they're spending and their revenues ramp-up. And so like many companies, you sometimes have the good problem that the more you bring new customers in, which is a good thing for the long-term. In the short run that can create a little bit of a economic headwind. So that's the way I would think about this.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking question.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning, Craig.\nJeff Campbell: Hey, welcome back.\nCraig Maurer: Thanks. It's been fun getting the business up and running for FT Partners. And again, I appreciate you taking the question. So with thinking about credit, if we look at what drove the provisioning expense in the quarter, it looks like the allowance build was actually materially less than it was in fourth quarter despite the relatively similar provisioning \u2013 provision amount. So it seems like you were soaking up the losses that were driven by the rise in delinquent season in the back half of last year, but you only saw a very small increase in delinquencies in the quarter. So I guess the question is, are you comfortable with where allowance levels are now especially considering they're materially higher than where they were going into the pandemic?\nSteve Squeri: Well, let me, can I work backwards? I think the simple way because this is such a complex subject as you know, Craig that I always encourage people to think about this, is take the reserves on the balance sheet divided by the total loans and receivables. That ratio is 2.5% at the end of this quarter compare that number to what was day-one CECL, it was 2.9%. You can compare that same number to every other financial institution that reports, and I think that's a simple way to both track us versus history and us versus other companies. And as you know, our 2.5% is by a long shot best-in-class relative to what others have. When you think about sequential CECL accounting, what I would say is the fourth quarter of last year was probably one of the last quarter's that's still what I will refer to as pandemic CECL noise. In other words, all of the financial institutions built all these big reserves, released them at different times for us, and I think this is different from any other institutions; we're kind of past that. And so what you see starting in the first quarter, not in the fourth quarter of last year, is really not influenced by all the noise that the pandemic drove as we all built and then released reserves. It's why in some ways I think going forward from here you're back to, I don't know if there's such a thing as a BAU view of CECL accounting because none of us have done CECL accounting in a normal world. But for us we're sort of back at a fairly steady state run rate. So if you think about it, we expect loan balances to continue to build. We expect credit metrics to continue to moderate up a little bit and that will cause us to continue to build a little bit of reserve each quarter, and all of that is built into the guidance that we're referring today.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey guys, good morning.\nSteve Squeri: Good morning.\nDominick Gabriele: Thank you so much for taking my questions. So I know a lot of the business obviously depends on the consumer, but you do have a very large unique commercial business. And so if you think about the bank tightening, some belief will occur, how do you think this plays out through your large and FMB businesses if credit \u2013 access to credit changes? And how do you think those Domino's kind of fall in affecting their spending levels or whatever you think are the key elements there? That'd be great to hear your perspective. Thanks so much.\nSteve Squeri: Well, I think, let's look at \u2013 look at \u2013 let's look at how much it represents, right? Large and global accounts represent about 6% of our overall spending and not so sure when you look at that segment that sort of credit spend \u2013 credit tightening is really going to drive their spending. That is predominantly a T&E \u2013 a T&E game. And most companies are trying to get their people out and trying to get them to go out and travel and that spending has been up 34%. We're still not back to where we were. What normally affects that for us is more layoffs and things like that, but even in the face of layoffs especially the tech segment or late starts that are going to occur in consulting and things like that, I think if we're in a unique situation right now where I just don't think credit tightening in that segment is really going to be \u2013 is really going to be an issue. I think there it's going to be more of a \u2013 of an earning story. And do they do layoffs? But again we're in such a crazy spot where most people aren't traveling anyway and people are encouraging to travel; I don't see that. I think when you look at small businesses \u2013 small businesses go in and out quite a bit and you could see with some credit tightening some small businesses having harder access to some \u2013 to some working capital. What I would say is one of the things that that we do have from a small business perspective is we are really with our launch of Blueprint and Kabbage and so forth. We have working capital loans, we have short-term loans, and so forth and we're not in the same position as a lot of these other smaller banks are. And so for those credit worthy small businesses we will continue to extend credit and it could be an opportunity for us actually, provided to credit is, the credit is good. So I think in general it can affect the small business economy and our ability maybe to grow, to get working capital. But I think it also provides us with an opportunity because we may not be the lender of first resort to these small business right now, and I think it could be an opportunity for us again judiciously, but an opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great, thanks. Jeff, you had talked a little bit about the OpEx being kind of flattish over the course of the year, I think, I mean, historically that had kind of been seasonally low in the beginning of the year and seasonally high at the end. Is there something that's changed with respect to that?\nJeff Campbell: Yes. I think, look, every year's a little different and you have a higher growth rate year-over-year, Moshe, this quarter because you think about 2022, we really were in a ramp-up, as were many companies, as we came out of the pandemic, as we all dealt with what was some pretty high attrition in late 2021 and 2022. And we were sort of fully ramped to where we needed to be. I mean, the way we think about OpEx in \u2013 and this is actually the way we talk about it internally as well, is we have a lot of confidence in the very high revenue growth rates that we have set out in our guidance, 15% to 17% this year. We built the infrastructure of this company through the end of last year to manage that level of volume and revenue. So, we are where we need to be to manage that, which is why we\u2019d expect sequentially this year to find that OpEx pretty flat. So, we provided guidance for OpEx of about $14 billion. If you take out the $95 million mark-to-market loss we had on our ventures portfolio, which was mainly driven by one company, we\u2019re pretty much tracking right to that. And I think our record, I would suggest, over more than a decade is when we tell you we\u2019re going to hit a certain OpEx number or control OpEx, I think we have a pretty good track record of doing that. So that\u2019s how I would think about it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please go ahead. \nBob Napoli: Thank you and good morning. Question just on big picture, if you will, from \u2013 if you look at the big tech companies like Amazon and Apple and their involvement in financial services getting a little bit more, and I know that in some ways, they\u2019re partners. But what are your thoughts around the competitive risk from the large tech companies? They seem to be getting more and more involved in credit cards and other financial service types that might be competitive.\nSteve Squeri: Well, look, they\u2019ve been involved for a decade. And we \u2013 obviously, we partner with Amazon. We work very, very closely with Apple on Apple Pay and obviously, they\u2019re a large merchant and a large partner. And it\u2019s not just Apple and Amazon we look at. We look at all the fintechs and the startups and what have you. And I think \u2013 and that\u2019s why we always say, when you look at competition, it\u2019s just not the traditional banks. It\u2019s the fintech. It\u2019s the big tech players and so forth. And the reality is that the way that you have to compete not only against them, but compete against everybody else is, you have to give your customers what they want and you have to continually to develop better value propositions. And so yes, these are great companies. There are great banks out there. There are great \u2013 Amazon and Apple are phenomenal companies that know the consumer. We believe, we know the consumer as well, and they help us raise our game overall. But we\u2019re not na\u00efve enough to think that we can just go on sort of strolling down the street here thinking, who is ever going to compete and no one\u2019s going to come after us. The way \u2013 we\u2019re paranoid. We think everybody is coming after us. And it\u2019s one of the reasons that we constantly focus on upgrading our products and services. And it\u2019s one of the things that we talk about. We\u2019re constantly adding value to our products. Yes, it would be probably easier to not do that, but we challenge the team constantly to develop better value propositions. And so we worry about everybody. And the only thing that we can do about it is continue to do what we\u2019ve done for years, offer the best service, offer the best products and make sure that our customers are happy.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nDon Fandetti: Good morning, Jeff. I was wondering if you could talk the banking crisis. Do you expect that to impact your ability to buy back stock? And also, was there any impact from the Delta sharing adjustment? And will there be any this year?\nJeff Campbell: So two very different questions. So capital and liquidity Don, I mean we are in a very strong position. Our capital target of 10% to 11% on a CET1 basis is actually well above the regulatory requirement. Our target is really driven by the rating agency view. So, I know exactly what\u2019s going to happen from a regulatory perspective, but even some change in the regulatory environment that significantly increase the capital we need to hold is unlikely to have any impact on what we actually hold today. And so look, our company has a ROE of 30% or better. We generate a tremendous amount of capital. We don\u2019t need that much capital to support our organic growth. So you\u2019ll see us continue to aggressively buy back shares, which is why \u2013 the Board, in fact, approved a huge new multi-year target for share repurchase earlier in the quarter. Our liquidity position is also very strong, as I talked about in our remarks. When you think about headwinds in 2023, I\u2019d remind you on the January call, I pointed out that a 500 basis point increase in interest rates in a year is a headwind for us year-over-year in 2023, which won\u2019t really exist in 2024. And they\u2019re unlikely to do another 500 basis points. For that matter, I just talked in response to Craig\u2019s question about the fact that our provision this year is kind of back to a steady-state level, whereas last year, you had it still greatly impacted by see its reserve releases. So those are two headwinds in 2020 we will not have in 2024. You have put your finger on the third headwind, which is we have a fabulous partnership with Delta works great for them, works great for us. We work together all the time. Seem to see Steve together like every week practically. But it is true that when we renewed early the partnership back in 2019 and extended it through 2030, we agreed to a change in the rates of how some of the economic sharing work effective the year in the original contract is going to expire, which is 2023. So there is a step-up this year that flows through various lines in the P&L but generally falls into the variable customer engagement line. So that\u2019s part of what drove us up a little bit on the 42% to 43% target that we have this year. I would point out, that\u2019s another sort of headwind to our earnings growth this year that we will not face in 2024. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. \nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on T&E renormalization. With T&E up 39% again year-on-year, it\u2019s still clearly renormalizing a bit post-pandemic, as you highlighted, particularly outside the U.S. Do you have a sense like looking under the covers at the spending dynamics how much further that has to go and when we might see that piece that\u2019s been driving your disproportionate growth moderate a little bit? I think some folks might have been expecting that to start happening already at the beginning of this year, but clearly it\u2019s not happening. So, I\u2019m wondering how many \u2013 how much more we\u2019ve got to go on that? Thank you. \nSteve Squeri: Well, I think you still have quite a bit to go on T&E and especially as corporations start to bring back their T&E spending as well. And T&E spending is up in every single segment that we have. I mean, we talked about total T&E up 39%, consumer is up 30%, commercial is up 41%. It just keeps \u2013 it keeps growing. And we talked about international, up 59%. So, we still think we have more room to grow. And I talked about bookings with airlines, and airlines will also expand their capacity. And as they expand their capacity, we\u2019ll continue to grow with them. So, I think there\u2019s still more upside in airlines. And when there\u2019s more upside in airlines, it becomes more upside in lodging. And people have gotten used to eating out. And the restaurant spending is \u2013 if you ask me about anything that surprises me, it would be restaurant spending continuing to be as strong as it is. But I think for us, a lot of that has to do with Resy. And the fact that we are able to probably even get a larger share of our card members\u2019 restaurant spending as they book their reservations through Resy \u2013 and the other thing I\u2019d point about Resy, Resy has been a really nice addition to our acquisition of new cardholders who have a propensity to want to \u2013 eat at restaurants and T&E. So, I think you\u2019re still going to see very strong T&E throughout this year. It will certainly outpace our Goods and Services. And we\u2019re getting back \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to climb back. If you remember, pre-pandemic, we were around 70-30 in terms of our spending: 70% Goods and Services and 30% T&E. And there really is no reason that should not go back to the way it was. So, we think we have upside in T&E.\nKerri Bernstein: Okay. And with that, operator will close the call.

Thank you, please go ahead.\nKartik Ramachandran : Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri : Good morning, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We had another strong quarter that reflects the steady earnings power of our business model and our continued investments for growth. Earnings per share in the third quarter were $3.49 and revenues were $16.6 billion, up 8% over last year, marking our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenues. Based on our performance to date and the strong earnings we're generating, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance to between $13.75 and $14.05, up from $13.30 to $13.80. And we continue to expect full-year revenue growth that is within the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year at around 9%. I feel good about our performance to-date and the ongoing strength of our business, and I remain confident in our long-term growth prospects. A key reason for my confidence is the sustainability of our product refresh strategy and the growth it is generating across our portfolio. We have already achieved our plan of refreshing 40 products globally this year, and we expect to do several more by year end. As we do so we're adding value to our offerings by embedding new benefits and services that reflect the financial and lifestyle needs of our existing premium card members and attract new ones. A great example of this is the US Consumer Gold Card. We talk a lot about the Platinum Card and with good reason, but the Gold Card is also a critically important product in our portfolio. Gold is a very popular product with total US Consumer Gold acquisitions, currently running at about 30% higher than Platinum. And it's our number one premium product for Millennial and Gen-Z consumers, with 80% of US Gold Cards we acquire coming from this cohort. In designing the refresh Gold Card, which we launched in the third quarter, we know that Millennials and Gen-Zs are especially interested in dining. In fact, these younger card members transact almost two times more on dining and make up a higher percentage of users on our Resy restaurant booking platform than other generations in our card member base. With that in mind, we enhance the already rich dining benefits that come with Gold Card membership, and as we've done with other refreshes, the value of the additional benefits is greater than the annual fee increase. While it's very early days, we're seeing strong new account acquisitions and continued high retention levels among existing US Gold Card members, indicating that our customers see real value in the enhancements we've made. This is a pattern we see when we refresh our products. We add value that resonates with premium customers and we price for that enhanced value, which results in strong acquisition and retention numbers that drive spending and consistently strong growth in subscription-like fee revenues. The Gold Card is just one example of how dining is playing an increasingly integral role in our membership model. Dining is an important category across our premium customer base. In fact, spending on restaurants continues to be one of our fastest growing T&E categories in our US Consumer business, increasing 7% in Q3 versus last year and growing at nearly twice the industry rate overall since 2019. And with total restaurant, food service spend estimated at $1 trillion in the US, dining represents a significant opportunity for us to further differentiate Amex membership. This is why we're investing and building out our dining capabilities. First with the acquisition of Resy in 2019, and more recently with the additions of Tock in Rome, both of which have closed since we announced them in Q2. We've made significant progress to-date. We've successfully scaled Resy since acquiring the company with over 50 million registered users, and in the last 12 months alone, the platform has seeded over 350 million diners. We're also embedding Resy benefits in several of our value propositions, including the US Gold Card I just mentioned, as well as our US Consumer Platinum Card and the Refresh Premium Delta SkyMiles co-branded cards we announced in February. In addition to the many benefits for card members, Resy strengthens our membership model in other important ways. It connects our restaurant merchants with high spending premium customers while also providing them with state-of-the-art technology platform that helps them grow their businesses. Furthermore, Resy\u2019s large user base gives us access to a pool of potential prospects who enjoy dining but do not yet have an American Express card. Our newest acquisitions will expand on the benefits we offer consumers and merchants, driving value for both. Tock extends our dining footprint with millions of additional users and thousands more bookable venues including wineries, hotels, and certain events in addition to restaurants. With Rome, hospitality merchants can have access to sophisticated integration capabilities across various restaurant management platforms and the ability to enhance live event and stadium experiences. While the competition is fierce in the dining space, we believe our business model advantages, including our premium customer base, the strong merchant relationship we have with restaurants and other hospitality providers and our membership model, position us well to continue our growth in this important category. As we demonstrate it, the investments we continue to make in our value propositions as reflected on our product refresh strategy and in our capabilities, as seen in the example of dining, are fueling our momentum. And these are just a couple of the examples of why I remain confident that our long-term growth aspirations are the right ones. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Christophe for a more detailed look at our performance in the quarter.\nChristophe Le Caillec : Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before going into the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to take a few minutes to step back and highlight the key takeaways from our year-to-date performance. First, our business model is performing really well. We had another solid quarter of earnings generation with EPS of $3.49, even as we continue to invest significantly in marketing and technology. The spend environment has been stable over the course of the year, and revenue growth is in-line with our expectations with a year-to-date FX adjusted growth of 10%. We continue to add many more customers to the franchise. Transaction engagement is deepening, and we benefit from our diverse set of customer types, revenue streams, and geographies. In addition, as Steve discussed, our focus on continuously refreshing products is resulting in an acceleration in our card fees revenue, which grew by 18% this quarter. And our focus on premium products continues to be the foundation of our very strong credit performance. We continue to manage our expense base with discipline. Year-to-date, excluding the gain from our Accertify, operating expenses have grown very modestly as we fully leverage the scale and the digitization of our operations. This business model is yielding very strong earnings, which is enabling us to increase investments to grow the franchise and also to return excess capital to our shareholders. Compared to last year, we reduced the number of shares outstanding by $24 million. Turning now to our Q3 spend performance on Slide 3. Build business grew 6% on an FX adjusted basis, continuing the trend of stable volume growth that we've been seeing over the past several quarters. And while T&E growth rates are now more in-line with what we're seeing on goods and services spending, the picture hasn't changed very much since last quarter. Our customers continue to deepen their engagement with their American Express card as the number of transactions was up 9% in Q3. This is a function of growth in the number of customers and merchants, as well as growth in the number of transactions per customer. For instance, transactions per customer are up around 30% from five years ago. As you look at the spend trends by segment over the next few slides I want to highlight a few key points to take away. Spend across our [affluent] (ph) US consumer base continued to be very stable with strong growth from Millennial and Gen-Z customers, up 12%. Notably, we continue to see very strong loyalty with this younger cohort with new customer retention higher than that of older generations. Within Commercial Services, spend growth was up modestly and consistent with what we've seen over the past few quarters. Our fastest growing segment again this quarter is international card services with spend growth of 13%. The breadth of this continued performance is especially worth noting every one of our top -- five top markets is growing in double digits with four out of the five in mid-to-high teens. For example, Japan is up 17% and Mexico 15%, on an FX adjusted basis. We also see strong engagement from Millennial and Gen-Z customers in international with the age cohort growing 23% FX adjusted in Q3. Let me now turn to lending and credit performance on Slide 7 through 9. Total loans and card member receivables growth was strong at 10% year-over-year and continued to moderate as expected. Loan growth was 15% this quarter, consistent with Q2. Our enhanced lending capabilities such as pay overtime continue to be the largest contributor to our loan growth. In addition, over 70% of revolving loan growth continues to be driven by tenured customers. Looking ahead, we continue to see a long runway for growth as we expand our share of lend with our Premium Card members. While revolve rates have largely built back since the pandemic, we expect to see continued upward momentum over time, as we meet more of our customers' borrowing needs on our premium products and grow our charge in co-brand portfolios. Our focus on growing lending through our premium customer base also continues to pay off in the strength of our credit performance. Delinquency rates remain very low and in-line with our prior quarters, especially taking into account the seasonal downtick we saw in Q2 and write-off rates declined to 1.9% this quarter. Looking forward, I still expect modest upward buyers to these rates, as we continue to acquire new customers at elevated levels and increase our share of lending from existing customers. This quarter, we had about $1.4 billion of provision expense. This includes a reserve bill of $264 million which was predominantly driven by loan volume growth. The reserve rate was 2.9% consistent with recent quarters. Taking a step back, this best-in-class credit metrics are a reflection of our strategy. Our product value propositions create a powerful positive selection effect, which carries through to better credit performance. Our risk management strategies and capabilities widen the margin of safety and ensure profitable growth. Focusing next on revenues, starting on Slide 10. As I noted earlier, we grew total revenues net of interest by 8%. Discount revenue our largest revenue line grew 4% versus last year and is driven by the spend trends I discussed earlier. Net card fees increased 18% on an FX adjusted basis, accelerating 2 points sequentially, driven in part by the product refreshes. And we continue to see strong demand for our products as we bring new customers into the franchise with new cards acquired of $3.3 million in the quarter. Our strong acquisition and retention levels, along with our ongoing cycle of refreshing products continue to drive sustainable growth in card fee revenue. This strong growth represents a real proof-point of the success of our strategy and the continued engagement of our customers. Turning to our lending economics on Slide 14. Net interest grew 17%. Net interest income grew 17% on an FX adjusted basis and continues to moderate as we previously communicated. Growth in this line is driven by increases in revolving loan balances and net yield versus the prior year. I will turn now to our expense performance on Slide 15. Our VCE to revenue ratio remained stable at 41% this quarter with variable customer engagement expenses up 10% versus last year. Looking at some of the components of VCE, rewards expense this quarter grew 10% outpacing spend growth. We are continuously evolving the MR value proposition to increase the ease of redemption for our card members and also to maintain the economics of the program. In the short-term, those changes drive a very small increase in the ultimate rate of redemption but over time, we are confident in the economics with minimal impact to the VCE ratio. And we continue to invest in our card member benefits to deliver superior experiences for our customers. For example, this year, we've added over [three-entry] (ph) new hotels to the hotel collection program, one of the benefits on the Gold Card, and we see that year-to-date bookings on the program are 6 times higher than five years ago. Marketing expense was $1.5 billion, in-line with our run rate so far this year as we continue to invest at elevated levels versus last year. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect our full year marketing spend for 2024 to be around $6 billion, as we lean into the attractive growth opportunities available to us. Lastly operating expenses of about $3.8 billion were up 5% versus last year. There is some seasonality to operating expense levels, and we expect to see a slight uptick in Q4, consistent with prior year's trend. On a full year basis, we continue to expect operating expenses to remain fairly flat year-over-year, adjusting for the Accertify gain. Taking a step back, total expenses year-to-date are up about 5% relative to 10% growth in FX adjusted revenue. This is a reflection of our ability to invest at elevated levels and drive strong expense leverage. Let me now move to capital on Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, well within our 10% to 11% range, and we returned $2.4 billion in capital to our shareholders. This is the highest return included -- sorry, this capital return included $1.9 billion of share repurchases, the highest level in the past two years and $0.5 billion in dividends. Also, we continue to have a very robust and diverse funding stack at our disposal. Our high-yield savings balances grew by 19% year-over-year this quarter. Notably, over 75% of balances come from existing card members, though less than 10% of our US consumer customers have a high-yield savings account with us. This brings me to our 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of around 9% within the revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. We are also raising our full year EPS guidance to $13.75 to $14.05, reflecting both the momentum and the earnings power of our business. This represents 23% to 25% year-over-year growth. It is higher than we expected at the start of the year and above our long-term aspiration of mid-teens growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kartik, and we will take your questions.\nA - Kartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate the solid results in what clearly is a softer spending backdrop. I guess I'm just thinking about the updated guidance. And as we think about that 10% plus revenue expectation in the future, I mean is that possible in the current spending backdrop? Next year, as I think about it, NII will be slower, card fees obviously, should be stronger, but does bill business have to accelerate to get to double digits? Or is there another way? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Thanks, Sanjay. Look, I think that the bill business definitely has to accelerate to get to our aspirational goal of 10% revenue growth. When you think about the three legs of the stool that we have to grow our revenues, I think we absolutely have the right balance, the balance of spending NII and card fees and card fees continue to grow at accelerated rates. It is 25 straight quarters now of double-digit. We had 18% this quarter. NII continues to chug along, but I don't think anybody wants to see us really accelerate too much from there. And I think that as we think about our overall aspiration, that aspiration was set in a more robust environment. And so for us to hit that 10%, we would need to have an acceleration in building, certainly an acceleration from 6%. Having said that, and I said this about a year ago at the Goldman Sachs conference, we have driven the scale of this business at this point to such a place that even with a softer, albeit consistently, it is been consistently soft for the last -- pretty much for the last year, if you go back our billings overall for pretty much the last year other than the second quarter when we had the extra day, have been about 6% overall. But yet, we are able to deliver on our mid-teens EPS growth. And I think that's what our focus is really on. And so as the economy gets stronger, when that is I don't know, but I think it is absolutely the right aspiration for us as a company to strive for 10% revenue growth, but we will need an acceleration in billings.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hi, good morning guys. Steve, thank you for the branding of our conference on the prior response. So maybe just a follow-up on Sanjay's question. When you think about the three legs to the stool, if we don't see an acceleration in billings growth, can you maybe just talk about the drivers of EPS growth into 2025? Can you continue to sustain the mid-teens growth even in the face of a challenging -- of a slower than aspirational revenue growth environment? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: I mean, just -- if you look at this year, as I just said, we've had billings growth of pretty much 6% for almost a year now. And so I'll just go back to my comments that I just made to Sanjay. I think at the level of that 6% overall billings growth and we continue to acquire cards, and we continue to upgrade card members, and we continue to grow NII where we are. Yes, I think EPS growth in the range -- in our mid-teens range is absolutely something that should be expected from us. The other thing that I would say is that while we are not -- if you look at this year, we've acquired 3.4 million cards in the first quarter and 3.3 million cards in the second quarter and 3.3 million cards in the third quarter. And that's all about really the future for us. And as the economy gets stronger, these are cohorts and most of these people that we're acquiring are Millennials and Gen-Z. These are cohorts that will continue to grow with us. That we'll see an uptick in organic spending over time. That will wind up being upgraded from a green to a gold to gold to a platinum and so forth. And so once again, I think that we are really laying the foundation with the investments that we're making for strong growth going forward.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Maybe I will just add one point. This year indeed, is a good reference, right? And we are going to grow EPS north of the mid-teens, even when you control for the Accertify gain. And that's after increasing the marketing investments year-over-year by as much as $800 million, right? And so that speaks about the power of generating mid-teens EPS growth despite a 6% billing growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Hi, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask about business development spend came in well below what consensus was expecting. And I was curious what is happening there, whether it was a short-term phenomenon or something more long-term? And just second, was there any impact from weather in the guide for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Let me -- I'll answer the second question, and Christophe will answer the first one. No, there was no impact at all from weather in the guide at all.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. And on their business or partner payments line and business development, a lot of those expenses are about the agreements that we have with customers and co-brand partners in terms of sharing the economics of the co-brands. And specifically, in terms of this quarter the reason why that number is not growing as much as maybe you were expecting is because -- on the small -- on the corporate side, we also have agreements in terms of incentives that we pay back to our customers. And since the billing is coming at a lower level. So are those incentives that we pay back to their customers.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks for taking my question this morning. Look, as we move into the fourth quarter, the setup is that earnings will be way above initial guidance and even above the second quarter increase and revenues are gravitating towards the low-end of your range, that suggests credit and operating leverage are better than you expected. You've talked about the ramp in marketing the incremental $800 million. Historically, when earnings setup is this strong, you really pull forward investments planting seeds for long-term revenue growth, I'm curious this year why you're letting so much fall to the bottom-line? Are you starting as you ramp up that $800 million incremental? Are you starting to see the marginal return on those investments diminish in a way that it is no longer attractive?\nStephen Squeri: No, I don't think we are seeing the marginal return. I think it is a matter of ramping. It is just ramping up to the level that we are. I mean, when you think about how much we are spending on a relative basis at 1.5 -- almost $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in marketing, we're stepping up that marketing almost $800 million. We've also stepped up technology spend. We've invested -- we're investing more in control management as we move from a Category 4 bank to a Category 3 bank. And so we are not walking away from any investments in -- it's -- but we are also not -- what we're also not doing is we're not lowering our standards in any way either. So no, I think that we've ramped up our investments all year long. It is just really hard to then just jam a bunch more investment into next year. Having said that, we expect that we will grow our investment levels from here as we move into 2025. I would not expect a pullback in marketing because as we start to look at next year, we are looking for more efficiencies, obviously, in our marketing spend. But additionally, we are looking to invest more in marketing as we move into next year and more in technology and so forth. So when you think about the business, from a quarter-to-quarter basis, yes, it is easy to have that -- the assumption that you have. When you think about the business on a continuum, you have to layer in your investments over time. So it's not as easy just to pull sort of investments in from the first quarter of next year into the fourth quarter of this year. Years ago, we could do that because our investment levels were probably half of where they are today. And so as you get to that to that level that we are today, it is easier to go on a continuum in the way we are going as opposed to, hey look, there is an opportunity, let\u2019s pull it \u2013 let\u2019s just pull it forward. So we feel good about the investment opportunities over the next \u2013 over the medium to long range, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the business.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Erika Najarian of UBS. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. When I look at the supplement, it does seem like spend on a per member basis has been a little bit flatter than overall spend growth, 2% versus 6%. And clearly, that's a result of your success in adding so many new customers. If we don't get the rebound in spend growth next year, and obviously everyone is trying to figure out whether we are going to have the soft landing or not soft landing, how much runway do you feel you have to continue to add new customers to keep the spend growth at the current level? And maybe as a compound question to that, maybe give us some color on where we are on the product refresh cycle?\nStephen Squeri: Yes. So let me answer the second part and then go to the first. I think on the product refresh cycle, we've already surpassed -- we're at our 40 that we had committed to at the beginning of the year. And there will be some more refreshes that will be done over the rest of this year. And we will continue refreshing on next year. I will let Christophe comment a little bit, but I will just give you a couple of other points as it relates to your first question. We still see line of sight as we move into next year to acquire more card holders. I think when you look at the overall spending, organic spending in our customer base is not as robust, as it was in a more robust environment. And that's what our card holders do. What our card holders will do is pull back slightly if they lose any confidence, see any sort of signs of their own stress but they will continue to pay their bills, and that's why our credit numbers are so good. I think when you look at the organic piece of this, you see this especially within our small business. Our small business has been hit from a macro perspective. I think just like a lot of other companies, small business and at the organic spend or the same-store sales spend that is occurring on the card in small businesses is certainly not as robust as it was coming out of the pandemic. In fact, it is negative because when you look at our small business, our acquisition is good and our retention is really good. It is that organic spend that's down. And so that organic spend leads to a slight depression in spend per card member.\nChristophe Le Caillec: And so to add up to the other part of your question, the metrics you are looking at is an average is a global average. So that adds up customers in Australia and Japan, as well in the US. So it's hard to read a lot of insights out of that metric. So to give you a bit more color on how to think about those new card members that are joining the franchise, we do see that they are more engaged than the past vintages, if you want. When we look at the number of transaction per new card member that number is trending up. And in my prepared remarks, I cited the metric of 30% more transaction per new card member now than five years ago, and we see that, right? And this is a function of better coverage, not only in the US, but also outside of the US. And we stick to the premiumness of our acquisition. Not only we grew the number of card members, as you pointed out, but we are maintaining the fact that about 60% of them are coming up on our fee-paying products. So they are very engaged. And so each vintage, if you want is definitely showing progress, and what's impacting this average are the things that Steve talked about and that the tenured card members and what we call the organic spend that is a little bit more challenged.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandetti: Steve the general consensus, pretty much among everyone, is at the affluent US consumer is in good shape. I just wanted to get your sense if you are seeing anything in your data bookings that would raise concern around the sustainability of that, you've got an election coming up and things of that nature?\nStephen Squeri: No. I mean, look this company has been around a long time. I mean, obviously, we didn't have cards 174 years ago. But we've been around lots of different elections, lots of different configurations of the House, the Senate and so forth. Our customer base is very different than our competitors' customer base. And it's really resilient and pretty stable. I think that they are continuing to spend, albeit at not levels that we saw coming out of the pandemic. But the US consumer, just to pick the US consumer has been really stable. I mean, it's been just about 6% for the last few quarters. And if you look at the international consumer and a lot of people forget, we do have the international side of our business, international consumer business has been growing 13% for the last four quarters as well. So we are not seeing anything that would indicate that spending would go down. And we are not seeing anything that would indicate our credit metrics are getting any worse. In fact, you saw write-offs go sequentially down. And so we feel good about the consumer. We would like to see more organic spend. And I think to go back to the beginning, when Sanjay opens us up with that question, I think an uptick in that organic spend will help us reach our overall aspiration of 10%. But that's why our aspiration of 10% is in fact an aspiration, and I think still the right aspiration for this company because we do expect organic to come back. Organic will not stay at this level forever. When that comes back, I don't know. But regardless, and as we've proven this year, we're able to still deliver that mid-teens EPS growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Adelson: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just if we look at the approximately 9% revenue growth for the year, as you sit here only 18 days in the quarter, does that suggest that you are maybe looking for a little bit of revenue growth reacceleration in the fourth quarter here? Or how are you thinking about that 9% for the year? Could it maybe slip a little bit below that? And when we look at the discount revenue growth, it did go under the bill business growth a little bit this quarter, I think the implied discount rate did drop a little bit. Is there any noise in there? Or is there something we should be aware of there?\nChristophe Le Caillec: So I'll take the second part of your question first in terms of how to think about the discount revenue versus the bill business. As Steve just mentioned, international is growing at a faster clip than the US. And as you probably know, the discount rate in international is lower than in the US. So that creates a little bit of a disconnect between the growth you see in discount revenue and on bill business globally. As far as the first part of your question in terms of how to think about revenue growth and how to think about Q4, the best way to -- the key word that we've been using this morning is stability. We see stability in terms of billings, in terms of the trends and no inflection points. So as you said, we are only like a few weeks into Q4, but my projection for Q4 is to be a continuation of a lot of these trends. So Q3 is a good proxy for what to expect about Q4, and that's why we are guiding towards 9% revenue growth. I want to point out though, that the EPS in terms of the full year performance is also really north of what we guided towards at the beginning of the year, even when you adjust for certified. So we are generating a lot of earnings even with being at a 9% revenue growth, which still -- when I listen to peers, it compares really well to most of our peers.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chris Kennedy of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nCristopher Kennedy: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned how customers generally move from Green Cards to Gold Cards to Platinum Cards. Is there any way to think about the lifetime value or average spend by category? Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: I think when you when you start to move up the food chain, you move up because you are going to -- for example, you are moving from -- if you are a Millennial for example, and you are on a Gold Card, you're probably not traveling as much, but you're dining out a lot and you may be just starting with the franchise. As you start to move along, you might have a little bit more discretionary income. You're traveling more, you're taking advantage of lounges, you're taking advantage of fine hotels and resorts and hotels. And so you will see higher spending on Platinum cards than you will on Gold Cards and on Green Cards because if you are going to pay a higher fee for a product, you are going to engage in that product more, you are going to use that product for what the benefits of those -- of that product, in fact is. So -- and when you think about it, the Platinum Card while it is morphing into much more of a lifestyle card overall still has heavy travel benefits to it. And to really take full advantage of that, you want to be traveling in -- airline tickets cost money and hotels cost money and so forth. So I think, as people do move along the continuum, you do have a higher lifetime value depending upon when you enter the franchise, right? So if you enter the franchise at a Gold Card level and then ultimately upgrade to a Platinum, yes, you will have a higher lifetime value overall to us. If you enter as a Gen-X or a Boomer into the Platinum franchise, which we still acquire Gen-X's and Boomers, obviously you'll probably have a lower lifetime value than you would as a Millennial who ended in as a Gold card member. So it all depends on the entry point. But in general as they move up, we get more value out of them.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about how to think about net interest income dynamics as we head into 2025 and just what the building blocks are? Steve, I think you mentioned that you don't want to accelerate too much from here. But if you could just -- Christophe, if you could just give us some of the building blocks in terms of how to think about NII in this rate environment, your liability-sensitive, deposit dynamics, revolve rates, balances and stuff like that? If you could just kind of help us think through how to think about the evolution as we head out into 2025?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So the first thing maybe is to remind ourselves that we are slightly liability sensitive, but only very slightly. And the impact of Fed funds rate cuts on our NII is actually quite small. And we regularly update this sensitivity in our 10-Q, and you'll see later this afternoon, we updated those numbers as well. They're really small. And so maybe we can put this one out of the equation. The rest is a volume rate balance. So from a volume standpoint, we have said that you should expect the volumes, the AR especially the revolving balances to moderate in terms of growth. And the dynamic, I mean, we're all familiar with that. During the pandemic people pay back their balances and have been rebuilding slowly their balances. And the revolve rates that we see now are starting to stabilize and moderate. So I think we are -- this \u2013 I\u2019d say, this normalization is -- for the most part, is behind us. And so you expect now the growth rate to very much moderate. And from a yield standpoint, there are two things here, right? The first one is we are -- we keep shifting the funding of those balances towards high-yield savings accounts, which is the lowest funding cost for us. And so this creates a positive impact or positive effect on the yield. And on the interest income, we keep working in terms of making sure we have the right price points, we constantly compare our price as well against our peers, and we make sure that we are well-positioned there. And so we should expect the yield to benefit from this dynamic. But the way to think about it is moderation in terms of volume. We are going to maintain the strong yield that you see now and very, very limited impact from any change in the rate environment from a Fed fund rate standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Terry Ma of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTerry Ma: Hi, thank you. Good morning. So your card acquisitions continue to run at a pretty healthy level and your net card fee growth this quarter has already exceeded the exit rate of last year. I guess are you running ahead of your expectations for some of these product refreshes in terms of adoption or engagement in general?\nStephen Squeri: No, I think it is what we really expected from an adoption and engagement perspective. As I said, there'll be a few more product refreshes. This is where we pretty much expected the overall growth rate to be little bit -- obviously higher than when we entered the year because that's what happens, right? People get attracted -- I think -- get attracted to the products. I think one of the things that -- and we've said this before, but I think it is worth repeating, when you refresh the product, what it does, it creates more demand in the marketplace, and it helps your marketing dollars work even harder for you. And so when you look at how that category of revenue grows early on, those categories are from new card holders. Remember, we amortize that over a 12-month period and not everybody gets repriced all at once. So it does build in for us a ramping up effect of that overall category. So not only is it important to upgrade these products because it enables you to attract new card holders, but enables you to continue to engage with your existing card holders. But it does add to that, obviously, that overall subscription like and SaaS like revenues that card fee subscriptions are. And we are over $2 billion in this particular quarter. So we continue to focus on that because what we know is our fee-paying Card Members are our most engaged cardholders that we have because they \u2013 we want them to use the benefits and services.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Thank you. I have a related question to the impact of Fed easing on your business. Have you looked at kind of what the impact is from Fed easing and the effort to stimulate the economy on your bill business growth?\nChristophe Le Caillec: So this is a good point. So at this point in time, the reduction is too small. It is too early to see any impact in terms of the spend patterns, and we looked into it but there is like nothing visible, as you would expect, probably too small. But the expectation is that the consumer and small business confidence is going to improve as a result of the rate environment being more supportive. Because -- as we said this morning, right there are -- we see no evidence of stress in terms of credit. We see demand in terms of our premium products. We see very strong renewal rates even when Card Members are moving to a higher price point. So there is definitely capacity to spend \u2013 to spend more. And my expectation is that the accumulation of cuts will provide some support for the consumer and small business confidence and that will provide some support to billing. And in order to go back to the first question we addressed this morning, especially to that organic growth that would benefit from that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Wanted to turn to T&E spend for a second. And just a two part question on that. The first is just on airline spend. I think it accelerated this quarter. Can you just talk about the drivers there? Was it corporate, consumer, both, what you saw there? And then just on restaurant spending. I think it was \u2013 it detailed a little bit this quarter, but just going back to the opening remarks, you referenced just the investments you're making in that category between Resy and Tock, and just adding those benefits to various cards. Do you expect restaurant spending as a category to become a bigger part of your business and grow? Like should we expect acceleration in that spending from here? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. So let me talk about restaurant spending. So when you look at -- before we made our foray into sort of the restaurant reservation business here with Resy, restaurant spending was not our biggest T&E category. Our biggest T&E category and still our fastest-growing T&E category right now is restaurants. And our expectations are that we will continue to gain share in that restaurant space. If you look at it, we've -- just over the last five years, we've grown twice what the industry growth rate has been from a restaurant perspective. Yes, there was a little bit of a decel this quarter, but I guess 8% to 7%, but I'm not really all that concerned about that. And I think with our Tock acquisition and so forth, I think we will continue to punch above our weight from a restaurant perspective. I'll just give you a high level on airline. I don't think there's really a lot of change whether it's from a corporate perspective or a consumer perspective from airline, I mean, you went from 5% to 6%. I mean that's not in some cases, it can just be a little rounding up or a little rounding down quarter-to-quarter. But airline is still strong. And as we said, we saw international bookings -- I mean I didn't say this, but we saw international bookings in the third quarter from our travel business actually be at the highest levels since before the pandemic. So our Card Members are still looking to travel. They are looking at -- when you are traveling internationally, you tend to spend a little bit more than when you're traveling domestically. So I don't think there is much to read into the airline piece of it or the restaurant piece other than restaurant is still a very, very strong category for us. But the 1 point up and 1 point down, I wouldn't make too much about for this particular quarter. But I think that from a restaurant perspective, we obviously are doubling down on restaurant, not only from the perspective of what we've done with the Tock in Rome acquisition, but just look at the Gold Card refresh, which is a heavy dining product and it's targeted at a cohort Millennial and Gen-Zs that spend more in dining than any other cohort that we have. So we are pretty bullish on the restaurant industry.\nKartik Ramachandran: With that, we will bring the call to an end.

Welcome to the American Express Q2 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Kartik Ramachandran. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our earnings release issued a short time ago, we reported strong second quarter results and raised our EPS guidance for the full year, based on the continued momentum we're seeing in our core business. Revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high and earnings grew 44% year-over-year or 21% after excluding the gain of $0.66 we realized from the sale of Accertify. The strong performance of our core business year-to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year will enable us to increase our investments in marketing and other strategic areas that drive our growth without using any of the proceeds from the Accertify sale, while still delivering exceptional earnings results. In fact, we now expect to invest around $6 billion in marketing this year, up about $800 million versus last year, all of it funded from the results of our core business. As a result, we are raising our EPS guidance range for the full year to $13.30 to $13.80, up from $12.65 to $13.15 previously, and we continue to expect revenue growth in-line with our 9% to 11% range for the year. As we've seen through the first half of the year, our core business continues to generate strong momentum, even against the backdrop of a slower growth environment. The continued momentum we're generating reflects the earnings power of our business model, which is driven by several interrelated factors, including. First and foremost, the quality of our loyal premium customer-base, plus the increasing scale of our business, a well-controlled expense base, the success of the strategic investments we're making to enhance Amex membership and our talented colleagues around the world. Our continued strong performance starts with our premium customers, who are high spending, long-tenured and have excellent credit profiles. And we continue to attract large numbers of high quality premium customers with our superior products as seen in the consistently strong new account acquisitions and 24 consecutive quarters of double-digit card -- double-digit growth in card fee revenue we've delivered. Next is scale. Over the past few years, the scale of our business has grown significantly. Compared to year end 2021, revenues have grown by nearly 50%, card member spending has increased by almost 40%, cards-in-force globally have risen by around 23 million, or about 20% and the number of merchant locations on our network has grown by over 30 million, or nearly 50%. This increased scale drives growth and gives us significant flexibility in running our business for the long-term. At the same time, our operating expenses are growing well below revenues as we drive efficiencies across the business. The combination of our increasing scale in our well-controlled expense base produces significant operating leverage that generates more investment dollars we can inject into our business. Another key factor driving our momentum is the success of the strategic investments we've been making in critical areas like marketing, value propositions, technology, control management capabilities, and talent to sustain our growth. And to keep the momentum going, we're continuing to invest in enhancing our unique membership model through ongoing product innovations and new capabilities and benefits. For example, as we execute our strategy of regularly refreshing our products, we focused on embedding additional value in our premium cards to make them highly attractive to customers across generations and geographies. This enables us to add large numbers of new premium card members to our customer base, drive greater engagement with existing customers and price for the value we add. We are on track to refresh approximately 40 products globally by the end of the year. As part of that number, we look forward to announcing our refreshed US consumer gold card in the coming weeks, adding to the nearly two-dozen refreshed and updated products we've announced through the first half of the year. We also continue to add new capabilities and benefits through both internal innovation and bolt-on acquisitions. For example, our Resy dining reservation platform has seen significant growth since its acquisition in 2019 and our planned acquisitions of Tock and Rooam will further expand our dining portfolio, giving our customers access to more great restaurants and increasing the digital offerings we provide to restaurants and merchants in the Food & Beverage industry. Finally, our talented colleagues across the company are the engine that drives our growth. Their creativity, determination and deep commitment to providing the best customer experience every day is what has made American Express what it is today and will continue to make us successful in the future. The combination of all these factors is what drives our premium business at a scale that can deliver superior earnings on a sustainable basis. The power of our unique business model and the ongoing momentum we're seeing in the business, driven by our loyal customers and dedicated colleagues, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our expectations for the year and our long-term aspiration for the business. With that, I'll now turn it over to Christophe.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect another quarter of strong performance. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Second quarter revenues were $16.3 billion and grew 9% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Net income was $3 billion in the quarter, generating earnings per share of $4.15. Our second quarter results also reflect the sale of our Accertify business, which closed during the quarter. We recognized an after tax gain on the sale of $479 million, equating to $0.66 of EPS impact. Excluding this gain, EPS grew 21%, reflecting the power of the business to generate strong earnings growth even in a slower growth environment, as Steve noted. On Slide 3, Billed Business grew 6% versus last year on an FX adjusted basis, reflecting stable growth and in-line with the softer spend environment we've seen in the past few quarters. The stability in spend growth was also visible by category where we saw 6% growth in goods and services, 7% growth in travel and entertainment spending. We did see some slower growth in certain T&E categories versus the prior quarter, such as in airline and lodging. At the same time, growth in our largest T&E category, restaurants remained strong and goods and services strengthened a bit versus the prior quarter when excluding the impact of leap year. Stepping back, while spend growth in certain categories was slightly higher or lower versus the prior quarter, overall spend growth was stable and we continue to see strong growth in the number of transactions from our card members, which grew 9% this quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses. Starting with our largest segment on Slide 4. US consumer grew billings at 6% this quarter with balanced growth across both goods and services and T&E. Our premium customer base continues to demonstrate steady growth. We also saw growth across all generations. Millennial and Gen-Z customers grew their spending 13% and continue to drive our highest billed business within this segment. These younger card members continue to demonstrate strong engagement and we see that they transact over 25% more on average than our older customers. And in some categories like dining, they transact almost twice as much. Turning to commercial services on Slide 5. Overall growth came in at 2% this quarter. Spending growth from our US small and medium enterprise customers increased a bit sequentially versus last quarter but remained modest. Lastly on Slide 6, we see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services, up 13%. We continue to see double-digit growth in spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers and we are also seeing double-digit growth across all regions. Stepping back, we continue to see stable spend growth across customer segments, spend categories and our US and international geographies. And while we are not in a high growth spend environment, particularly in the US, our spending volumes are tracking in-line with our expectations and support our revenue expectations for the year. Moving on to loans and card member receivables, on Slide 7, we saw year-over-year growth of 11%, demonstrating strong growth, but continuing to moderate as expected. As we progress through 2024, we expect loan growth in particular to continue to moderate by a few percentage points, but it still grew in double-digits as we exit the year. Turning next to credit and provision on Slide 8, through 10, our credit performance remains very strong and is a direct result of our disciplined growth strategy which has been focused on growing our high credit quality premium customer base, including through the younger customers we attract to the franchise. This strategy, coupled with our robust risk management practices are an important aspect of our business models. Going forward, we expect our write-off rates to remain generally stable for the remainder of 2024. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter reserve build of $101 million is mostly driven by growth in our loan balances, largely offset by lower delinquencies. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.3 billion of provision expense in the second quarter. As you see on Slide 10, we ended the second quarter with $5.6 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our loans and card member receivables, a slight decrease compared to Q1. It's worth noting that there is a seasonality component to reserves, although we are also encouraged by the strength of the performance we see in the portfolio. Moving next to revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues were up 9% year-over-year, benefiting from the diversification across revenue streams, customer segments and geographies. Looking at the components of our revenue, our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 5% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 13, we're now generating over $2 billion in quarterly card fee revenue as the differentiated value and experiences we offer on our products continues to resonate with our card members globally. This is an important metric for us because it also reflects the choice that our costs -- that our customers make each year to renew their membership. We're pleased with the growth and expect to exit the year with further momentum. In the quarter, we acquired 3.3 million new cards, demonstrating the demand we're seeing for our products and the investment we've made. Acquisition of our premium fee based products continued to account for around 70% of new accounts. And importantly, as we have increased the total number of cards acquired, we have maintained disciplined underwriting standards. Moving on to Slide 14, net interest income was up 20% year-over-year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances, which also contributes to the continued net yield expansion versus the prior year. As we've shared before, we continue to expect this growth to further moderate as we progress through the year. To sum up, revenues on Slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum even in a slower growth environment, as our results in this quarter were fueled by growth in all our major revenue lines across each of our different business segments and across geographies. Moving to expenses on Slide 16, starting at the top of the page, variable customer engagement expenses came in at 42% of the total revenues for the second quarters. Looking forward, I expect variable customer engagement expenses as a ratio of revenues to be in-line with this level for the balance of the year. On the marketing line, we continue to invest at an elevated level at $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Given the strong performance in the core business, we now anticipate our full year marketing spend to be around $6 billion or 15% higher versus last year as we plan to invest at high levels to sustain our growth momentum. To put this in perspective, this is an incremental $800 million above what we spent in 2023. At the same time, we intend to deploy those investments in a disciplined way. As I discussed at Investor Day, our investment optimization engine is engineered to make profitability based decisions at the margin and there is a high bar for returns on these substantial incremental investments. Moving to the bottom of Slide 16, brings us to operating expenses. Operating expenses were $3 billion in the second quarter, down 13% versus last year due to the $531 pre-tax gain we recognized from the sale of our Accertify business. Excluding the gain, operating expenses were up 3% in the quarter, well below the pace of revenue growth even as we continue to invest in technology and our control management capabilities. Excluding the impact of the Accertify gain, we continue to expect operating expenses for the year to be fairly flat to 2023. This quarter's results demonstrate how the scale of the business and strong expense discipline enable us to generate significant efficiencies and those efficiencies are enabling us to invest at elevated levels while still generating significant levers to drive strong earnings growth. Turning next to capital on Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio was 10.8% at the end of the second quarter within our target range of 10% to 11%. We also returned $2.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion of share repurchase. This is the highest level in over two years. And the recent CCAR results further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our business model. The stress test results show that under a severely adverse scenario, our portfolio remains profitable. In fact, we are the most profitable financial institution as a percentage of asset growth across all the banks subject to CCAR and have the lowest credit card loss rate under stress as well. These results in our stress capital buffer remaining at 2.5%, the lowest prescribed level. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near term changes to our capital management approach. This brings me to our 2024 guidance on Slide 18. Let me step back and make a few observations about the growth in the business and the way we see the balance of the year unfolding. First, we have a core business that is comfortably generating mid-teens EPS growth, even in a slower growth environment and before the gain from the Accertify sale. Second, the pace of earnings generation in the core business, combined with the strong demand we are seeing in the market for our products, is enabling us to invest around 15% more in marketing compared to last year. As a result, we are able to fund significantly more investments from our core business than our expectation at the start of the year without relying on the one-off gain from Accertify. With that, as Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance for EPS for the year to a range of $13.30 to $13.80, and within that range, we now expect to drop all $0.66 of the Accertify gain to the bottom line. This is a departure from our usual practice of reinvesting a significant portion of one-off gains in growth initiatives. But we are confident in the ability of our business to support the year-over-year growth of around $800 million in marketing while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. Finally, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the year in-line with our initial 9% to 11% range. With that, I turn the call back over to Kartik to open up the call for your questions.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Christophe.\nStephen Squeri: Good morning.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Steve, can you maybe expand on what you're seeing in the US consumer and SMEs? In US consumer, we saw a little bit of a slowdown from 8% to 6%. Are you seeing a broader slowdown in the consumer? Maybe just talk about what you're seeing on a same store sales basis? And then on the SME side, you obviously saw a slight uptick. So maybe if you could just expand on those both. Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. So I think look, in US consumer, you saw a little bit of a sequential decline. But also remember, last quarter, we had the extra day. So it's not really apples-to-apples. But listen, the US consumer was 6% up for the quarter. It continued to be strongly influenced by Millennial and Gen-Z growth. It's now up to 33% of our total billings and they're up 13%. And so we feel good where the US consumer is. Obviously, organic spending, we'd like to see a little bit higher, but it is a slower growth economic environment. But one thing I will point out before touching on SME. When our consumer, a lot of their spending is discretionary and for our consumer, if they decide they're going to pull back, they'll pull back a little bit on a discretionary, but they'll continue to pay their bills, which is why our credit numbers continue to be so strong and we continue to widen the gap between us and our competitors. So we feel that, look, the US consumer has been pretty consistent and we think it's going to be pretty consistent throughout the year. From a small business perspective, while there still is an organic decline year-over-year, that organic decline is less than it was last quarter and the quarter before that. So, we're seeing slight improvement. In both the US consumer and in small business, retention is still strong and acquisition is still strong. And so, what I like about where we're sitting is, as the economy rebounds, whenever that may be, organic will pick-up driving future growth. And then just a last comment on international, you didn't ask about it, because probably it is so strong, it's up 13% in the quarter and even small business and commercial within international is up 14%. So we feel good about where we are right now.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDonald Fandetti: Yeah. Can you talk a little bit, I know you're reiterating your revenue guide for '24 of 9% to 11%, but just given results, do you think you're sort of more leaning towards the mid-to-lower end? And then can you talk about where you're investing in marketing in terms of US consumer, commercial and international?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. So I think, look, quarter-to-date, we're at about 10% both reported and FX. And for the quarter, we were at 8% and 9%. And so I think we're going to wind-up within that range. And I think depending upon how organic either rebounds or stays where it is, we'll determine where we wind-up within that range, but we're very comfortable with sort of the 9% to 11%. As far as investment, what we do is, we will look at the myriad of opportunities that we have to acquire more card holders and depending upon at any given point in time because our acquisition engine is a very dynamic engine and things change all the time. We will allocate those investments either US consumer small business or international. Traditionally, the US consumer business would get more of that investment, followed either by international and small business. But as I sit here today, it's hard to say exactly what percentages will be, but it will be focused on acquiring more cardholders. And the key about that is that when we acquire cardholders in the second half of the year, it's really not going to drive spending for us this year. It will -- what we're doing here is we're investing for the medium and the longer term and it will acquire cardholders that will spend for us, for us next year. So I think the takeaway from the point that Christoph made and the point that I made is the business is so -- we feel the business is strong right now that we're able to invest more and we have line of sight into those opportunities without compromising on credit.\nChristophe Le Caillec: The only thing I will add to that, Don, is that the revenue growth was exactly as we were expecting it to be. And as we talked about it under Q1 call, we talked about stable billings, which is exactly what we got. We talked about card fee remaining in terms of growth where it was in Q1 before picking up a bit of momentum in the balance of the year. We still think that is the right way to think about card fees. And we talked about NII growth rate moderating a little bit. So that revenue growth is where we thought it would be.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I think I heard you say a gold cart refresh will probably be announced shortly. I guess, just can we contextualize what that means? I assume it probably helps card fees next year. And then just the spend trends intra-quarter, were those pretty stable? It sounds like they were, but just clarifying.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. So, not going to get into the details of the card. But what I would say is, one of the big advantages of the refreshes is it makes the marketing dollars work a lot harder, right. So what happens is, when you do a product refresh, whether it's Gold, whether it's Delta, whether it's Hilton or whether it's another Gold or Platinum card that we do internationally, what happens is you're able to provide more value to those cardholders that already have the product. You may be able to upgrade a Green to a Gold. And obviously, you're able to acquire even new cardholders with that. And what happens is as you go out and acquire new cardholders, you'll have buzz around the fact that we have a new card and it has obviously a different value proposition and you'll have the marketing that goes with it. And so, when you do a refresh and you have your marketing spend, that your marketing dollars work a little bit. The overall value proposition is a lot stronger and it works a little bit harder for you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: And when it comes to their intra-quarter billings, we typically don't talk about those and there's nothing much to say here. So there's nothing noticeable in terms of monthly billing growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nCraig Maurer: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the marketing spend and it seems like you're putting the pedal down. So typically, when American Express does this, it's because -- or at least in the past, you've seen this happen because Amex is either anticipating or already seeing a slowdown from competitors in terms of their market activity and you see a significant opportunity to gain share. Is that -- is any of that thought process going into this year? And second, business development costs were lower than what was being forecast. So I'm curious if that's due to some slower partner growth that might have meant less incentives or what went into that? Thanks.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. So a couple of points, I think $6 billion for the year in total marketing is not an area we've ever -- it's not an area we've ever been in before and an $800 million year-over-year increase is a pretty significant increase. I think that when we make a decision, Craig, to put more marketing dollars in, it's because we see the opportunity. And if you look at where we have been from a marketing spend for the first two quarters, that would show a trajectory of $6 billion. So we're really keeping all of our marketing spending consistent quarter-to-quarter because we do see the opportunity. And we see the opportunity within the credit box and within the dimensions of who we're looking for, for our cardholders. It's not due to a -- we're not making this investment because of a slowdown in billings. This was something that we had planned to do at the beginning of the year where billings were, where they weren't going to be. And as far as competitors pulling back, I don't see competitors pulling back at all. I think competitors right now -- the environment is just as competitive as it's ever been. Obviously, you make these investments because obviously you want to gain -- you want to gain more traction with your cardholders and you want to gain more share.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Craig, let me add a few things and I will also answer your question about business development expenses. So the other element here to factor into the decision to invest more is the visibility we have in the balance of your performance. The business is generating a lot of earnings. We have more visibility in terms of the credit performance in the balance of the year in terms of the OpEx as well and that gives us confidence in our ability to actually deploy more marketing dollars. And to get to your question about business developments, it's expenses, there's nothing here significant. There was in the quarter some efficiencies, I will use that word in terms of the commercial spend and the incentives that we have with some card members and partners here and it gave us a bit of efficiency, but there was nothing related specifically to co-brand partners or anything of that nature.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Shane: Thanks, everybody for taking my question. And I apologize, I can't see my computer this morning, so it's a little hard to get context on the marketing spend. But what I'm trying to understand is the following. What I've heard is that given the strength of the underlying business, the incremental marketing spend is going to be funded organically as opposed to from the Accertify gain. What I'm wondering is that $800 million year-over-year, has that changed materially from your prior guidance? Have you, in fact increased your expectations and funded it organically? Or is it roughly the same and it's just a matter of how you're going to pay for it?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. Let me take that question and I hope you fix your computer problem soon. The way to think about this is, we always -- so we entered the year thinking we want to invest and we want to invest more because we see the opportunities and they are compelling investments with attractive returns. The fact of the matter is that the core business, which I would define as like the business, excluding the Accertify gain is generating more earnings than we had anticipated. So you're right, we can afford to spend more and to fund it through the core business. But on top of that, we also raised a little bit our marketing dollars. Now it's not a significant amount. As we've said in the past, in a given week, we spent $120 million on average of marketing dollars. So $100 million or $200 million a bit more or a bit less, it's actually not that material. But the key thing here is that in terms of the funding, it's going to be funded all from the core business and because it's generating more earnings than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Adelson: Hey, good morning, Steve and Christophe.\nStephen Squeri: Good morning.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Good morning.\nJeffrey Adelson: Just wanted to revisit the credit quality a little bit. I know last quarter, Christophe, you were talking about your expectation for write-offs to kind of continue ticking up from here. And it seems like your view has now shifted to a more stable outlook over the rest of the year. Can you just maybe talk about what you're seeing from your core customers' health and maybe what's driving some more confidence in the outlook there? And then should we also be thinking about a stable reserve rate from here versus, I think you were talking about more of an uptick over the rest of the year as well previously? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah. Hey, good morning, Jeff. So you're right, we have changed a little bit the way we think about credit write-offs for the balance of the year. And we are at the beginning of Q3 now, we had good visibility in terms of what's going to write-off in Q3 and Q4. So we can be more confident in terms of providing a direction here. And to your point, the direction we're providing now is that it's going to be like stable at about the level you saw in Q2 at around 2.1%. Now, I need to say this specifically to address your question on the reserve and how to think about it for the balance of the year. A big driver of the reserve is going to be the delinquency levels, right. Those card members that are showing signs of -- signals of stress early on. The delinquency improvement in the quarter, there is seasonality in that improvement, right. And so we expect that delinquency rate is just going to probably tick-up a bit in the balance of the year and that will drive a bit of incremental reserve together with the volume growth that we expect to see. But from a reserve rate standpoint, we are 2.8%. It's a good reference point for what to expect for the balance of year. It might increase a little bit. We'll see. It's hard to predict where CECL is just going to land exactly at the end of Q4, but it's a good guide in terms of what to expect for the balance of the year. I would expect 2.8%, maybe 2.9%, but we're going to be in that range. And to your point, credit losses, we expect stability from where we are now for the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMark DeVries: Yeah, thanks. As I think you pointed out, it is pretty unusual for you to let a gain like the Accertify gain fall to the bottom line. And I realize you don't give 2025 guidance, but Steve, just kind of wondering if you still expect to target that mid-teens EPS growth off this higher 2024 EPS level?\nStephen Squeri: Well, I'm actually glad you asked that question because it is a one-time gain. And so as we do give guidance for next year, we certainly do expect to be in that mid-teens EPS range. However, we will be -- and we'd expect that people would adjust for that one time gain. I think by calling out that one time gain the way that we have and not using it within the business, I think it makes your job a little bit easier to just sort of remove that and then build from there. Because, when you look at it, it's a one-time gain. That's why they call it a one-time gain. But the thing that I would also point out is that, because we have elevated our marketing spending to where it is using the core business and not use the one-time gain and that gives us the opportunity to actually reset our marketing at a much higher level for next year, which will allow us to drive even more growth as we go forward. So, that's the big advantage that we look at this by not using a one-time gain and saying, hey, look, that's what we didn't have in our core. By adjusting up our marketing by using core earnings, our anticipation is we'll be able to keep that marketing there and grow from there going forward versus going back to the $5.2 billion.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chris Kennedy of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nCristopher Kennedy: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. At the Investor Day, digital banking was one of the key areas of investment over the next couple of years. Can you just talk about those investments and what the goal is there?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. Look the overall goal is to be more engaged with both our small businesses and to be more engaged with our consumers. And I think, you know, digital banking is a bit of a journey for us. We now have multiple accounts and we're just going to continue to invest not only in capabilities, but continue to invest in making sure that our customers are using that. So there'll be more to come on that, but we're at the beginning of this journey and there's still a long way for us to go.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Terry Ma of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTerry Ma: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just want to get some more color on how your announced product refreshes are going in terms of just acquisitions, retentions and just overall receptiveness and whether or not you still feel pretty good about having net card fees exit the year higher than last year?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. In terms of acquisition or the product refreshes?\nTerry Ma: In terms of just overall how product refreshers are going? And whether or not, you still feel pretty good about having net card fee growth exit the year?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah, net card fee. So we feel very good about either adding a bit more momentum as we said in terms of the card fee growth, we are at like 16% FX adjusted and we are definitely expecting this to tick up a bit in the balance of the year. It's on the back of the product refreshes, but not only on the back of product refreshes, I mean they're the single most important -- as I said in my prepared remark here, single most important element of that is the renewed commitment that card members, tenured card members in the portfolio make every year to actually renew their membership, right. That's a super important element of the mix here. But card refreshes, we are on track. We talked about 40 products and we are tracking well against that. And as Steve said, gold is next to come.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. I mean we're about halfway through on those product refreshes. Gold is the next big one to come. And it's really a little bit too early to tell how each one individually has done. But what you look at is 3.4 million cards, 3.3 million cards acquired and retention rates are still strong. And those are the things that you look at, but we'll be able to have more color as the year goes on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning, guys. So a question on your EPS guide, the mid-point of your guidance range implies an EPS in the second half that at the mid-point of the range suggests around 2.6% growth. I think at the higher end, it's roughly, it's a little under 7%. Now, obviously, the higher marketing explains the bulk of it, if not all of it. But just wanted to ask, is there anything else there that is relevant that we should be thinking about driving that deceleration and maybe different than what you had anticipated? Because obviously, on a core basis, your numbers tripping out of Accertify have been better than expected in the first half, yet core basis kept EPS guide unchanged. And on that second half outlook, I think you have said in the past, correct me if I'm wrong, that card deceleration ends the year closer to 20%. I think you -- I don't think you've given a specific number on this call other than to say you see some acceleration, but it's 20% still the bogey there? Thanks.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So we haven't given a number. So, and I'm going to stick to that. But your math is -- we've done the math as well and we're looking at those numbers and you need to factor as well into account the fact that last quarter, we had like about $200 million of one-off gain as well. You might remember linked to the URR model. But when -- as you think about the balance of the year, there are a couple of additional items to bake into your forecast. The first thing is that, as I said it was one of previous question, I think it was from Jeff, we expect to build some balances in the balance of the year for credit reserves, CECL balance -- CECL reserves, sorry. And so, that will put a bit of pressure on the EPS. The second thing is that OpEx, we're investing in technology. As I said in my remarks as well, we're investing in our control management capabilities. And typically as well, it's a seasonal factor at American Express, we've seen operating expenses pick-up a little bit towards the end of the year. So when you bake all of this into account, including a bit more marketing that we are projecting at this at this point in time, in the balance of year, you actually get back on your feet and you'll see that the EPS cadence or run rate is actually not moving that much and remains like very high.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks. And is there, Kartik, as you look at the net interest income, that did decelerate about six points in the quarter from the first quarter level, but still the growth rate of NII is still well above the growth rate in loans. As you kind of approach the end of the year, do you think that those two kind of converge or will there be margin pressure? And could that net interest income growth be lower than the growth in balances by then?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yeah . Thank you for your question, Moshe. There are a couple of things to keep in mind here. The first one is that, as I've said, we should expect the volume, the balances, the loans to growth rate to moderate a bit further in the balance of the year, although it will remain in double-digit. From a yield standpoint, we have a slide that shows the yield. We had a bit of a yield improvement on the back of, I would say a few things, year-over-year yield improvement on the back of their revolve rates are a bit higher and they keep ticking up a little bit. And the second thing is and as we covered during the Investor Day on the funding side, we still have this dynamic around a bigger share of our funding mix going to high yield savings accounts, which for us is an effective funding channel. And so that dynamic is still going to play out in the balance of the year. And so you should expect to see the NII growth rate kind of like moderate a bit in the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will be coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to go back just on -- just staying on spending and revenue. Is it fair to say that you're planning for this softer spending environment to continue for the next couple of quarters. So discount revenue growth will be at like current quarter levels is probably a fair way to think about it or are you thinking any change in that trajectory? And then just relatedly on spending, if I could just -- if you could just discuss what happened in large and global spend? It looked like it decelerated a fair amount. So is there anything to call-out there? I mean, I know it's a smaller business, but it's a fairly meaningful deceleration.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So let me take the first one around how we're thinking about billing. So we are -- as I said, we see a lot of stability across the last two quarter, three quarters and even a bit further when you look at this in detail. So from a guidance standpoint, when we develop the guidance and the revenue guidance, that's what we bake in. If there is upside to that spend level, then all -- it's going to be a good thing for us. But from a guidance standpoint, that's what we are assuming on the revenue side. When it comes to global and large, last quarter, you remember, there was like a tick up, it was at 5%. This quarter there was a -- we're back to that 0%. There are few things here, like there's really nothing meaningful outside of like we noticed in like one specific client like a significant drop in terms of their card member usage, but there is nothing really material there, not big change, not an inflection point in terms of what we see in terms of corporate card spend. Donna, back to you.\nKartik Ramachandran: All right. Well, with that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you again for joining today's call and for your continued interest in American Express.

Please go ahead.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Daryl, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discuss. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO who will start with some remarks about the Company's progress and results, and then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Squeri: Thank you. Q1 was another strong quarter with revenues up 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion and EPS up 39% to $3.33. The trends we've seen for the past several years continued through the first quarter of 2024. Our double-digit revenue increase was driven by strong spending growth, up 7% overall on an FX-adjusted basis, with U.S. consumer card spending up 8% in the quarter and spending from international card members up 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. Spending by U.S. SME card members continued to be soft, but new customer acquisitions, retention and credit on our small business products all continue to be strong. Fee revenues again grew by double-digits, up 16% on an FX-adjusted basis. We continue to attract high spending, high credit quality customers to the franchise with new card acquisitions accelerating quarter-over-quarter, adding 3.4 million new cards in the quarter. Our fee-based products accounted for approximately 70% of the new account acquisitions globally and we continue to see strong demand from Millennial and Gen Z consumers, who accounted for over 60% of the new consumer account acquisitions globally. Finally, our credit metrics continue to be best-in-class. The ongoing momentum in our business is a result of the great work of our colleagues across the company and the loyalty and engagement of our premium customers around the world. Based on our performance and the trends we've seen through the first quarter, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS of $12.65 to $13.15. Our first quarter results continue to show that our strategy is working and we feel good about where we are and where we are heading. In 10 days, we'll be hosting our 2024 Investor Day. At that session, we'll have a series of presentations from our senior business leaders that, taken together, will demonstrate why we are confident that our long-term growth aspiration is the right one. We will discuss our strategy for growing our premium consumer base in the U.S. through our membership model, our plans for winning the recovery in the U.S. small business space, our runway for growth in international, our progress in expanding merchant coverage and enhancing our network capabilities globally, how we are driving efficiency, growth and service through technology, and how it all comes together from a financial perspective. We'll end our Investor Day with a Q&A session. Christophe will now take you through a detailed look at Q1 performance.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about the first quarter results, which reflect another quarter of strong results and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year. Starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. First quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.4 billion and earnings per share of $3.33. On Slide 3, billed business grew 7% versus last year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, in line with the overall spend environment we have seen in the past few quarters as we expected. Looking by category, we saw 6% growth in goods and services spending and 8% growth in travel and entertainment spending. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses. Starting with our largest segment on Slide 4, U.S. Consumer grew billings at 8% this quarter, with growth across all generations and age cohorts. Millennial and Gen Z customers grew their spending 15% and continued to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment. In fact, we see that younger customers use their cards more overall and this is even more pronounced in certain spend categories. For example, customers aged 35 and under use their cards at restaurants over 70% more on average than other customers in this segment. Looking at Commercial Services on Slide 5, overall growth came in at 2% this quarter. Spending growth from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers remain modest, given unique dynamics seen by small businesses. Lastly, on Slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services, up 13%. We continue to see double-digit growth in spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, as well as strong growth across our geographies. Overall, while we do continue to see a softer spend environment, our spending volumes are tracking in line with our expectations to support our revenue guidance for the full year and we are pleased with the continued strong engagement of our customers as the number of transactions from our card members continued to grow double-digits this quarter. Now moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth at 12%. As we progress through 2024, we continue to expect this growth to moderate, but to still grow modestly faster than billings. Turning next to credit and provision on Slide 8 through 10. First, and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices and our disciplined growth strategy. As we expected, our write-off and delinquency rates ticked up a bit, increasing very modestly quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect to see these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with some continued modest increase in 2024. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances combined with a modest increase in our Card Member loans and receivables delinquency rate resulted in a $148 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.3 billion of provision expense in the first quarter. As you see on Slide 10, we ended the first quarter with $5.6 billion in reserves, representing 2.9% of our total loans and Card Member receivables. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 6% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX-adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fees revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 13. We are pleased with this growth and continue to expect to exit the year with some further momentum reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In the quarter, we acquired 3.4 million new cards, demonstrating the demand we are seeing for our products and the investments we've made. Importantly, acquisition of our premium fee-based products accounted for around 70% of new accounts and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look strong. Moving on to Slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 26% year-over-year in Q1. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year. We do expect this growth to continue to moderate as we move through the year. And I would remind you that, for our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment this year. To sum up, revenues on Slide 15. The power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue growth momentum. I would note, as you think about the CFPB late fee rule, that late fees from our U.S. consumer segment make up a small portion, less than 1% of our overall revenue. While we have no specific plans to mitigate as of now, we are always looking at our pricing and policies in the ordinary course of business. Moving to expenses on Slide 16. Starting at the top of the page, variable customer engagement expenses came in at 40% of total revenues for the first quarter. As you look at these costs, I would note that Card Member rewards included a $196 million benefit as a result of enhancements to our remodels for estimating future membership rewards redemptions, some of which we reinvested for growth in our marketing line. Looking forward, I still expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue on a full-year basis as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our Card Members. On the marketing line, we increased investments to $1.5 billion in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the strong, high-quality customer acquisition and engagement we see as a result of these actions, and we are on track to increase marketing spend in 2024 versus last year. Moving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the first quarter flat to last year's expense and in line with our expectations for the year. When you look at the components of our operating expenses, salaries and benefit grew modestly versus last year compared to the growth we've seen in this line over the past years. This reflect the discipline with which we manage our expenses and is a great example of how we're able to drive efficiency while continuing to grow our business. We continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage and are focused on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. Turning next to capital on slide 17, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the first quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near term changes to our capital management approach. That brings me to our 2024 guidance on Slide 18. We feel really good about our first quarter results, which are tracking in line with our expectations for the year. These results continue to reinforce that our strategy is working and we plan to continue to invest to support our momentum. As Steve discussed, for the full year 2024, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and $13.15 and we remain committed to running the business for the long-term. As a reminder, this guidance and the items related to the full year 2024 that I just walked through do not include the potential impact from the sale of our certified business that we previously announced. We expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business, as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We still expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then. With that I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open up the call for your questions.\nKartik Ramachandran: Thank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjay Sakhrani: Thank you. Good morning. I guess question for both Steve and Christophe. Christophe, you said that you guys are seeing a softer spending environment. I'm just curious, when you look at the data, what's driving that? Is it inflation? Is it just a bit of tapering off after the post-pandemic spending? And I'm just curious, as we think about what gets that going again, what is it? Obviously, the comparisons get easier as well, so that should help. But maybe you could just walk through that. Thank you.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. Let me start and then Christophe can jump in. But when you look at overall spending, our overall spending is 7%, but consumer spending is 8%. And I think consumer spending is relatively strong. And when you look at international, international consumer spending is up 14%. And overall, international is up 13%. Where you're seeing some softness is in SME. And so SME is up approximately 1%. And so I think as SME comes back, which we look as an opportunity down the road, as SME comes back, that will drive some stronger spending. And I think the good things that we see from an SME perspective is that we are still acquiring cards, credit looks really good. And even though organic has come down, organic transactions have gone up. So I think in aggregate, we see softness. And I think a lot of that softness is driven from a commercial perspective, but 8% consumer growth in the U.S. is not too bad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the membership rewards expense. It looks like there's a little bit of a change there with model enhancements and stuff. Can you just talk about that a little more? Did the estimate for the URR, the redemption rate change from the 96% at year-end? Like, should we think of this $196 million benefit as a one-time thing? Or is that going to be continuous?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Hey, Mihir. Thank you for the question. So you should think about it as a one-time thing. And the URR is 96%. It's still at 96%. What we do is, because it's such an important model for us, we, on a regular basis, redevelop the model. And every time we redevelop the model, we try to enhance the model. So we feed the model with more data and try to refine their URR calculation. That's exactly what happened. And when we did that in Q1, we came back with a little bit of a benefit. I say a little bit because you have to remember that the entire membership rewards bank is about $14 billion. It's a bit less than $14 billion. So $196 million is very small compared to the size of the balance sheet. And so it's a one-off, and we don't expect something similar anytime soon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nMark DeVries: Yeah. Thanks. Could you discuss what drove the reacceleration in the new card growth this quarter?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. I mean, so we invested more. And I think when you go back and you look at the first quarter of last year, we had 3.4 billion -- 3.4 million, excuse me, 3.4 billion would be a pretty sizable amount of cards to acquire in a quarter. 3.4 million cards acquired. And if you remember at that time, you had the SVB situation. And so there was a pullback. There was not only a pullback on our side, there was a little bit of a pullback in the industry. And I think there was some consumer trepidation as well. And so as the year went on, we started to build up, and it culminated this year with -- in the first quarter of 3.4 million cards. We invested more in marketing, as we said we were going to do. But I'd also like to highlight that a key driver of that acceleration is the product refreshes that we do. We've talked a lot how product refreshes really stimulate demand and how it makes our marketing dollars work a lot harder. And so we had the delta product refreshes. We had a product refresh in Japan. We had a Hilton small business card. We had a British Airways card. And we're on our way to those 40 product refreshes that we talked about. And what product refreshes do, they do stimulate demand, and it stimulates upgrades and so forth. So that's really what's behind the increase sequentially of cards quarter-over-quarter. But we are sort of back to where we were at this time last year.\nChristophe Le Caillec: The only thing I would add, Mark, is as we increase the NCA, the percentage of new cards that are coming at a fee-paying product remains stable, about 70%, right? So it talks about the quality of this 3.4 million new cards.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nCraig Maurer: Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted to ask about your assumptions on Page 23 of the deck. It looks like for quarters, the second and third quarter, you are assuming a better macro scenario in the U.S. So just curious within combination of the rewards.\nKartik Ramachandran: Please stand by. We are waiting for our operator.\nCraig Maurer: Sorry. Were you guys hearing me or?\nOperator: I'm here.\nCraig Maurer: Okay, sorry. So what I was saying was with the what seems to be firmer macro assumptions for quarters, second quarter -- second and third quarter, and the rewards benefit, how come EPS guide was held flat? I'm assuming there's probably a bigger buffer in there. And second, if you could comment on what the trends have been in your loan workout program? Have you been seeing higher lower additions to that program? And how's progress been in terms of getting consumers on good payment plans and maintaining them? Thanks.\nOperator: American Express speaker line, are you guys there?\nKartik Ramachandran: Operator, can you confirm if you can hear us in the room?\nOperator: I can hear you. [Technical Difficulty] Ladies and gentlemen please stand by. We'll continue with the next question in just a moment.\nStephen Squeri: Hello. Can you hear us? Hello.\nOperator: Hi. I can hear you. Can you hear me? Hi. This is Rob. Can you hear me?\nKartik Ramachandran: Operator, can you confirm if you can hear us now?\nStephen Squeri: I can hear you. Daryl, do you hear them?\nOperator: Hi. This is -- I can hear everyone. I'm not sure. Please stand by while we check. We're experiencing some technical difficulty.\nKartik Ramachandran: For folks attending the call, we are going to dial back in. So please stay on the line. Or if the call does drop, we ask you to dial back in. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We will -- call will resume momentarily. Thank you. You guys are back. Are you able to hear me?\nKartik Ramachandran: Yes, operator. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nOperator: Okay. So that last question was from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Craig, you may have to ask your question again.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. We didn't hear it.\nCraig Maurer: No problem. Thanks and good morning again.\nStephen Squeri: Morning.\nCraig Maurer: So wanted to ask about the assumptions later in the deck. It looks like you're assuming a firmer economic environment for quarters two and three. So taking that with the benefit on rewards, should we assume there's a larger buffer built into your guide because you didn't raise EPS guide? And second, along the same lines, I wanted to ask about your loan workout program. Are you seeing any change in terms of the pace of loans being added or loans being worked out and how loans are progressing through that program? Thanks.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Okay. Hey. Good morning, Craig. Under how we think about the balance of your so -- we -- as I say, we are going to stick to our EPS guidance, not going to change that range at this point in time. There are still a lot of things that need to play out in the balance of year end. We think that that guidance best represent what we expect at this point in time. Specifically about how to think about that URR benefit, as I said in my prepared remark, I would say that a significant portion of that benefit was reinvested on the marketing line. We knew -- we saw that benefit coming in the quarter, and we took advantage of that as well to dial up the marketing. So all-in-all, it doesn't have a meaningful impact on EPS for the full year. When it comes to their -- what we call their financial relief program and the modified loans, so this is an important program for us. We have -- within one of their best program in the industry, we have innovative. For instance, we have a short-term program. We are also, in that short-term program, enabling the card members to retain some spend capacity and usage of the product. So we really think that it's a differentiator to help the card members that are experiencing stress. So that program is working really well for us. It's very effective. And what I can say is that the enrollment in the program has moderated in Q1, and that the performance of the card members within this program is very, very strong. We have a ton of metrics. We -- one of the metrics we talked about in the past was we are looking at payment loyalty and how much the card members who are either in delinquent status or paying us versus paying our peers. And we like what we're saying, right? We're typically front of their wallet in terms of repayments, and it's definitely contributing to the strong credit metrics that you've seen. We think it's also consistent with our brand in terms of being there for our card members and having their back. So that program is working well. But just to be specific on your question, the enrollment in this program is moderating in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Hecht: Morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. So I guess I'm going to ask about the Visa and Mastercard settlement, a reduction in interchange rates, and then some steering mechanisms. And I know historically, given your premium brand and so forth, those actions haven't had any impact on the business. But we haven't talked about that for a while. So I'm wondering if you guys just have some updated thoughts about that.\nStephen Squeri: Yeah. Well, it's really hard to say how it's going to play out over time. I mean, this has been going on probably close to 20 years, and it still has to be approved by the courts and we'll see. But what I would say is it really doesn't change sort of our strategy in any way. I mean, we are still focused on premium customers. Our customers still engage with the products. We'll demand to use the products. And we'll still maintain our virtual parity. So we'll see how it all plays out, but we are going to continue to focus on what we control. And the only other thing I would say is that our pricing is policies and structures are fundamentally different than the networks.\nKartik Ramachandran: Operator? [Technical Difficulty] screw around dialing.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and standing by. Our conference will resume momentarily. We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain on the line. And once again, your conference will begin shortly. Thank you so much for joining us. Okay. You are back in.\nKartik Ramachandran: Operator, we can hear you. Can you go ahead and ask for the next question, please?\nOperator: Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Adelson: Hey. Good morning, guys Can you hear me okay?\nStephen Squeri: Yeah, we can.\nJeffrey Adelson: Okay. Good. Yeah, I just wanted to ask on the prior combination you did last quarter about the card refresh plans for this year, 40 card products. I think from a quick count on our end, it seems like you've done eight so far this year with Delta, Hilton and maybe a card on India. Is that right? And maybe you could just talk a little bit about trajectory over the rest of the year, cadence over the rest of the year and what the response has been to some of those refreshes so far. I think more notably, the delta, the big delta one you did earlier this year, would be interested to hear the response you've seen from customers so far on that. Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: So the product refreshes will go out through the year. We don't really talk about exactly when they're going to be released. But you can rest assured all 40 will or approximately 40 will be done. It's a little early to tell on the refreshes as it's still in the early stages here. But what I would say, from a delta reserve perspective, it has really, really gone well probably beyond our expectations. So that is a -- it's a great product. It's a -- we raised the fee $100 and added over $500 worth of -- $560 worth of value. So that's going well. And as I said, the proof will be in the pudding because refreshes really do help to drive demand. It drives awareness. It not only -- and it drives more engagement with existing cardholders. And it's been a strategy that has worked very, very well for us over the last number of years, and it's one that we are committed to on a go-forward basis because it's not only important to again drive demand, but you really you want to reignite and reengage with the base. And what we really do is we look at what our customers really want and make sure that we are adding that value that makes the most sense to them.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Shane: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Steve, it ties in with what you're just talking about, when we think about the life cycle of a customer, it's acquisition, it's engagement, and then ultimately, it's loyalty and retention. And I think the real strength of American Express is on the loyalty retention side. When you talk about refresh, that's acquisition and engagement, can you talk about what you're doing investing on the back office side as the portfolio is growing so quickly to make sure that you maintain the loyalty and retention aspect of the business as well.\nStephen Squeri: Well, I think it truly is a virtuous cycle. And I think you've got it right. It's important to obviously acquire cards. And then as you acquire a card, you really want to engage them and get those cardholders spending in as many areas as they can. And so you look at this ramp-up period over maybe a zero to 24 month period. And then at that point in time, what's important is that we are engaging with the customer as a customer who is embedded within the franchise. And part of our marketing dollars not only goes to acquiring new customers -- but we look at how people are spending, we look at how they're spending relative to other people like them, and that's where you'll see offers to either upgrade cards, line increases, other products that we have. And so it's that constant engagement, it's the analytics that go behind it. That really leads to the retention. What you cannot do is once you have somebody, you just can't let them be stagnant. And so -- and there's a lot of learnings out of our commercial business and out of our merchant business where we have tremendous account managers that work with our clients on a daily basis, weekly basis to help them grow their spend. Now obviously, with tens of millions of consumer card members, you can't do that necessarily personally all the time, but you can do that through communicating through the channels that we have. And another big part of our value proposition and our service proposition is when people do call into us our customer care professionals are able to look at their spending, look at how they're doing and offer them other opportunities to really to grow with us, either from a -- again from a lending perspective or from a card upgrade perspective. So I think it's really important what happens on that back office as that continues to fuel that virtuous cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Carcache: Thanks. Good morning. Steve and Christophe. Although, you mentioned, Christophe, that the rewards benefit was one-off, are you seeing any evidence of customers deriving greater value from experiential and partner funded rewards. I'm just wondering if there's a possibility that pressure on the rewards rate could potentially abate in a sustained way as customers generate greater value in other ways?\nStephen Squeri: So let Christophe and get a little bit more into the detail. But I think you've hit on a really good a good point and one that really is part of our value proposition, whether it's embedded value that we get from our partners that's embedded in the value proposition and we're seeing that increase over time. And that's also, as you look at refreshes, you see that within the refreshes, but it's also the Amex offers and how we continue to work with our merchant partners to provide more benefits to our card members on an ongoing basis. So I think when you take that entire portfolio of the rewards opportunities that we have, the embedded value that comes within the value proposition and Amex offers all of that together, and it gets back to what Rick's point was, all of that together leads to more loyalty and more retention.\nChristophe Le Caillec: And to build that a little bit on the rewards side, we are constantly trying to innovate on the MR side. On the number of partners engaged in the program, the ease of redemption as well one of their later innovation that is actually very successful in terms of how many card members are using it is the ability just to select the transaction on your statement, your digital statement and actually using more points to pay for that specific transactions. And we're seeing a lot of card members using that. So we're constantly trying to make it easier and better for our card members to redeem to make the product the MR program competitive and more and more economic as well for us. So it's definitely a pace of innovation that is a very dynamic place.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nDonald Fandetti: Yes. Christophe, your international billed business growth continues to be very strong. Do you build that into your guidance at this level for '24 revenue growth? And can you give us an update on how your acceptance initiatives are going?\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So we are -- we -- ICS and International was the fastest-growing segment of American Express pre-COVID and has been for several quarters now as well. The opportunity is just much bigger for us in international. We have either -- we're also investing everything else being equal, proportionately a bit more in international, their brand out in international, it's probably a bit more premium as well than it is in the US. So there's definitely a massive opportunity for us, and we're going after it. and that's baked in our guidance for this year. It's also factored in as we think about our long-term aspiration. Part of -- part of the things that we're going to do to deliver on that guidance for this year and that long-term aspiration is actually to grow at a faster pace in international. It's a great opportunity for us for sure.\nStephen Squeri: So we're going to talk more about international at Investor Day. We'll have a separate segment on that. But we're also going to talk about how we continue to grow international coverage. And if you remember, a number of years ago, we talked about our international city strategy. We talked about industries we're going after. And so we'll provide some updates on that. But the top line is international acceptance continues to grow and continues to improve. And when you look at the international business growing at the rate it's growing and coverage continuing to grow, we see that as a long runway for future growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gus Gala with Monness,Crespi and Hardt. Please proceed with your question.\nGus Gala: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to dig in and ask, can we talk about the opportunities to lower cost of funding? And similar line of thought here. Can you talk a little bit about the pay overtime feature? Thanks.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So the pay over time, you mean like how it's performing, how it's growing pay over time?\nGus Gala: Yes. Let's talk about the performance and the unit economics if we can.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So pay over time is a facility that is available on our charge product. It's a service that a lot of card members are taking advantage of. It's the opportunity for them to revolve some of their transactions or part of their balance, their performance is very strong. It's actually the segment of our balances that is the fastest growing. And from -- I would say from a performance standpoint, because that product, but that service is attached to our charge card products, so typically premium card members the credit performance is also the best that we have in our lending products. So it's a very efficient way for us to grow balances by extending credit to premium card members. And the first question, I forgot was funding? And so the funding mix is still -- it's still evolving towards more deposits -- and as you know, deposits is, for us, they're the most effective and the most economical source of fund. And it's a very stable source of fund as well for us. I think we are -- we are at about 92% of our deposit. Direct deposit balances are below the FDIC cap. So it's a stable, resilient growing source of funding for us, and it's generating a lot of good things for us, including supporting our growth and growth plan and growth aspiration. And when you look at the yield that I had on the lending slide, one of the drivers behind the yield expansion year-over-year is actually a more effective cost of fund. And it's not a one-off, right, that has been a trend for several years now, and there is more to come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nMoshe Orenbuch: Great. Thanks so much. If you look at your commercial spending, particularly SME growth, it's been particularly weak the last couple of quarters, and you're noticing on Slide 5, the goods and services basically been flat to down for a couple of quarters. And you mentioned things that are unique to small business. But maybe could you expand that a little more and talk about what things we might see that would cause that to start to turn? And how long you can kind of maintain the kind of teens growth in loans while that is kind of flattish. Could you talk about those things? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: All right. Let me start and I'm sure Steve will add up to this. So you're right. I mean the SME billed business has been in that 1%, 2% range for a year now. We think that this is macro driven and we have a ton of data that confirms that it's not specific to American Express, and the rest of the industry is experiencing similar trends. I will note, as I think, we said in the prepared remarks that on the acquisition side, it's going very strongly. So the demand for the product is there. Their quality of the applicant is there as well. And as we've said in the past, it's the -- I would say, the 10-year base that is moderating their spend. We'll see how it goes, those card members, the SME, as we've said in the past, have been going through a lot. They're certainly experiencing as well their compound effect of funding costs for several years now. And they are very careful in terms of how they're managing their cash flows and how they're spending. This being said, we are very focused at working with them, as I said, engaging with them. And we're confident that we have what it takes to win them back when they are ready to spend more.\nStephen Squeri: Yes. I think that, Moshe, when you look at this, the SME has been -- this entire space has been sort of disrupted over the last four years or so maybe five years with COVID, where it took a tremendous drop for 18 months or so. And then all of a sudden, you had unbelievable unsustainable organic growth of like 19% and 20% in given years. It was crazy growth in '21 and '22. And we saw last year after the first quarter, it really started to wane. And again, a couple -- I think there's, again, a few reasons for that. I think there was a tremendous build-up in inventories. I think interest rates going up did not help from a small business perspective, especially as they thought about purchasing goods and services and buying those goods and services and stocking them in anticipation of another supply chain sort of malady or meltdown. And what we do like is that our acquisition is still very strong. The transactions, even within the tenured base, continue to go up, it's the larger transactions that we've really seen the organic decline on and a lot of that can be industry-specific construction, a lot of that can also be not buying -- not buying big inventories upfront. So I think what's important for us to focus on right now is to continue to acquire, continue to work with them and engaging with them. And then when they're ready to come back, we're there for them as they want to spend even more. As far as -- and I started the conversation with this, as far as overall spending, that's what makes me feel really good about our overall spending because we're able to grow 7% with our commercial business growing very low and small business is only growing at 1% and it's an important part of the franchise, and that's why we feel good because of the credit and of the new acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning, guys.\nStephen Squeri: Good morning.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: So maybe to bring together some of the pieces of revenue growth. I think you were on the high end of the first quarter, and I think Christophe, you said the expectation that NII was going to slow. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the trajectory of the revenue growth do we need to see spend stabilize to remain in the range? Or can we see the impact of refreshes and card acquisitions be enough to stabilize revenue growth within the range on a quarterly basis? Thank you.\nChristophe Le Caillec: Yes. So things are in Q1 played out as we were expecting, right? We -- billed business came in similar to what we had experienced in the previous quarters. Card fee is moderating slightly from 17% to 16% FX-adjusted growth rate. And we're still expecting that it will pick up a little bit in the balance of your on the back of the things that you said, including the card refreshes and acquiring a lot of premium cards. And NII at 26% is going to keep moderating because balances are moderating. So the guidance for the full year is still to be between 9% and 11%. We'll see exactly how things play out. There are still a lot of things to find out how the late payment charges are going to come in, what's going to happen with the interest rates. So best at this stage, I think, is to stick to the full year guidance of 9% to 11%. And -- but I would say it's Q1 validated the trends and the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year.\nKartik Ramachandran: With that, we will bring the call to an end.
