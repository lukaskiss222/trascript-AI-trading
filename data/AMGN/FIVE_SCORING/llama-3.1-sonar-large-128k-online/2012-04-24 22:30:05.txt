1. **Strong Q1 Performance**: Amgen reported record revenues and adjusted EPS, driven by broad momentum across its product portfolio, particularly from Neulasta, Enbrel, Prolia, and XGEVA. This strong start to the year is likely to be positively received by investors[4].

2. **Pipeline Progress**: The company highlighted significant advancements in its pipeline, including PCSK9 inhibitor AMG 145, psoriasis treatment AMG 827, and the initiation of Phase III enrollment for AMG 785. Positive pipeline developments often boost investor confidence[4].

3. **Commercial Performance**: Amgen's commercial operations showed resilience, especially in the face of competition and regulatory changes. The company's ability to maintain market share and grow newer products is a positive indicator[4].

4. **Guidance and Financials**: Amgen's guidance for 2012 remains strong, with expected revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.90 to $6.15. The company's financial health, including its cash position and share repurchases, is also favorable[4].

5. **Leadership Transition**: The smooth transition of leadership from Kevin Sharer to Robert A. Bradway and the positive remarks about the company's future direction under new leadership should reassure investors[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, promising pipeline developments, and a solid commercial strategy. This is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
