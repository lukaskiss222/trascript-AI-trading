The transcript for Amgen's fourth quarter and full-year 2006 financial results call presents a mixed picture with several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

## Positive Factors
- Strong revenue growth of 15% for the year, driven by products like Aranesp, ENBREL, and Neulasta/NEUPOGEN[3].
- Adjusted EPS grew 22% for the year, and the company maintained a strong balance between shareholder returns and R&D investment[3].
- Successful launch of Vectibix, with promising initial market share and clinical data[3].
- Robust pipeline with multiple Phase III studies and new molecule initiations, including AMG 531, motesanib diphosphate, and denosumab[3].

## Negative Factors
- Lower than expected revenue guidance for 2007 (8% to 12% growth), which might be seen as conservative compared to the 17% growth in Q4 2006[3].
- Negative results from the Aranesp anemia of cancer study, which showed no significant reduction in transfusions and a possible adverse effect on mortality[3].
- Potential impact from the anemia of cancer study on the broader anemia franchise, though management remains confident in the overall guidance[3].
- Regulatory and competitive pressures, including potential black box warnings and the introduction of follow-on biologics[3].

## Neutral Factors
- The company's guidance for 2007 takes into account various risks and opportunities, including the potential launch of peg-EPO, but management does not expect significant financial impact from these factors in 2007[3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the conservative revenue guidance and the negative results from the Aranesp anemia of cancer study. However, the strong performance in 2006, the positive pipeline developments, and management's confidence in their guidance may mitigate some of this pressure.
