The transcript of Amgen's third quarter 2006 financial results call presents several key points that could influence the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 15% revenue growth and a 22% increase in adjusted EPS, with raised guidance for the full year. This strong financial performance is likely to be positively received by investors.

2. **Product Launches and Pipeline**: The successful launch of Vectibix, the initiation of several mega-trials, and the acquisition of Avidia, which expands Amgen's therapeutic capabilities, are all positive indicators of the company's future growth potential.

3. **Defensive Measures**: Amgen's efforts to defend its intellectual property, particularly in the peg-EPO litigation, and the Fresenius partnership, suggest a strong position in maintaining market share and protecting key products.

4. **Challenges with Enbrel**: Despite overall strong performance, Enbrel's sales are not meeting expectations due to increased competition and market dynamics. However, management is taking steps to address this, which could mitigate some of the negative impact.

5. **R&D Investments**: The significant increase in R&D spending, while necessary for future growth, might raise concerns about short-term costs, but the company's pipeline and strategic investments are seen as positive long-term indicators.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, successful product launches, and a robust pipeline. The minor challenges with Enbrel and the ongoing litigation are manageable and do not significantly offset the positive news.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, successful product launches, and the company's strategic investments in R&D.
