The transcript for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Financial Results Conference Call presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Operational Performance**: Amgen reported solid financial results, including a 3% increase in total revenues for 2010 and an 11% increase in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[4].

2. **New Product Launches**: The successful launches of Prolia and XGEVA, along with positive early signs from these products, suggest potential for growth. XGEVA's strong start and the promising data from the 147 study are particularly noteworthy[4].

3. **Pipeline Advancements**: Amgen's research and development pipeline is advancing, with significant progress in several Phase 3 studies and the acquisition of BioVex, which adds innovative therapies to their portfolio. This suggests long-term growth potential[4].

4. **Guidance for 2011**: The company provided guidance indicating expected revenues between $15.1 billion and $15.5 billion and adjusted EPS between $5 and $5.20. This guidance includes the impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform and increased R&D spending, but overall reflects a plan to grow adjusted EPS[4].

5. **Challenges and Uncertainties**: Despite the positives, there are challenges such as the impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform, potential further declines in EPOGEN sales, and uncertainties around reimbursement changes. However, these factors are largely factored into the guidance and do not seem to significantly dampen the overall positive outlook[4].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong operational performance, promising new product launches, and advancements in the R&D pipeline.
