Amgen's Q2 2023 earnings call presented several positive and encouraging factors that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported record quarterly revenues of $7 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, and record non-GAAP EPS of $5, up 8% year-over-year.
2. **Volume Growth**: The company saw 11% global volume growth, with significant increases in key regions and therapeutic areas, including a 46% volume growth in the Asia Pacific region.
3. **Pipeline Advancements**: Positive data from several pipeline programs, particularly tarlatamab and LUMAKRAS, which showed promising results and have the potential to transform treatment paradigms in small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively.
4. **Commercial Execution**: Strong commercial performance with record sales for nine brands, robust volume growth across various portfolios, and positive trends in products like Repatha, Prolia, and EVENITY.
5. **Guidance Update**: Amgen raised its 2023 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects.

However, there are some potential headwinds to consider, such as the ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding the Horizon Therapeutics acquisition and the impact of biosimilar competition on certain products. Despite these, the overall tone of the call was optimistic, highlighting Amgen's strong performance and growth potential.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
