The earnings transcript for Amgen Inc. presents several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported solid financial results for 2015, including 8% revenue growth and 19% adjusted earnings growth. This consistent performance is likely to be viewed positively by investors[6.).

2. **Pipeline and New Product Launches**: The company highlighted significant progress in its pipeline, including approvals and launches of new products such as Repatha and Kyprolis. These launches, especially Repatha, are expected to drive future growth, although the current uptake is somewhat hindered by reimbursement and utilization management criteria.

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: Amgen increased its 2016 guidance, reflecting an improved revenue outlook and the inclusion of the R&D tax credit. This positive guidance should bolster investor confidence.

4. **Challenges and Headwinds**: Despite the positive aspects, the company faces challenges such as biosimilar competition for Neulasta and EPOGEN, and strict payer utilization management criteria limiting Repatha's uptake. However, management is actively addressing these issues, which could mitigate their impact over time.

Given these factors, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financial performance, promising pipeline developments, and increased guidance. However, the short-term impact may be slightly tempered by the current challenges in product uptake and biosimilar competition.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, driven by the company's strong financial performance, promising pipeline, and increased guidance. However, the immediate challenges might prevent a significant rally.
