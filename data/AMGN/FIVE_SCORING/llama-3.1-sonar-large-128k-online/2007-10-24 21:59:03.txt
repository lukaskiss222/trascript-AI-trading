The transcript for Amgen's Q3 2007 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Adjusted EPS Growth**: Amgen reported adjusted EPS of $1.08, a 4% increase over the prior year, indicating underlying financial strength despite challenges[1][4].
- **Cost Management**: The company has made significant progress in cost-cutting measures, with operating expenses decreasing year-over-year and expectations of continued expense reduction in 2008[4].
- **Pipeline Progress**: Amgen highlighted positive developments in its pipeline, including promising data on denosumab, Vectibix, and Romiplostim, which could drive long-term growth[4].
- **ENBREL Performance**: ENBREL continued to show solid growth, with a 16% increase in sales, despite some share loss to competitors[4].

### Negative Factors:
- **GAAP Earnings Impact**: GAAP earnings were negatively impacted by significant write-offs and restructuring charges, resulting in a GAAP EPS of $0.18, down from $0.94 in the third quarter of 2006[1][4].
- **Anemia Franchise Decline**: The anemia franchise saw a 16% decline, primarily due to label and reimbursement changes, which will likely take several quarters to stabilize[4].
- **Regulatory Uncertainties**: Ongoing regulatory challenges, including delays in ESA label revisions and the impact of the National Coverage Decision (NCD), continue to affect the company's anemia business[4].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the mixed bag of results, the short-term impact on Amgen's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The immediate concerns around the anemia franchise and GAAP earnings could weigh on the stock, while the positive pipeline developments and cost management efforts may not immediately translate into a stock price boost.
