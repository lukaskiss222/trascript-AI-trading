The transcript for Amgen Inc.'s first quarter 2008 financial results call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- **Adjusted EPS Growth**: Amgen reported a 4% increase in adjusted EPS, which is a positive indicator of the company's financial health[1].
- **Strong Pipeline**: The company highlighted significant progress in its pipeline, including advancements in denosumab, Vectibix, Sensipar, and Nplate, which could lead to future growth opportunities[4].
- **ENBREL Growth**: ENBREL sales grew by 30% in the first quarter, driven by both distribution changes and solid demand growth[4].
- **International Sales**: International sales, particularly for Sensipar and Neulasta/NEUPOGEN, showed strong growth[4].

### Negative Factors
- **Revenue Decline**: Total revenue decreased by 2% due to a tough year-over-year comparison, particularly affected by declines in the ESA franchise[1][4].
- **Aranesp Decline**: Aranesp sales declined significantly, with a 38% drop in the US market, largely due to label and reimbursement changes[4].
- **SG&A Expenses**: SG&A expenses increased, primarily due to higher Wyeth profit share expenses, although the company expects these expenses to stabilize for the full year[1][4].
- **Regulatory Uncertainties**: Ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding ESA labels and potential label changes introduce uncertainty and could further impact sales[4].

### Guidance and Outlook
- **Confidence in Guidance**: Despite the current challenges, management expressed confidence in meeting their revenue and EPS guidance for the year[1][4].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Amgen's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's robust pipeline, strong performance of certain products like ENBREL, and confidence in meeting guidance could offset the short-term negative impacts from the revenue decline and regulatory uncertainties.
