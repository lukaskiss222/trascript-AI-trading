Based on the transcript of Amgen's first quarter 2016 financial results conference call, here are the key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 10% year-over-year revenue growth and a 17% increase in adjusted earnings per share, indicating robust financial health.
- **Successful Product Launches**: Products like REPATHA, Kyprolis, and the Neulasta Onpro Kit showed strong performance and growth, contributing significantly to Amgen's revenue.
- **Promising Pipeline**: Amgen highlighted several promising pipeline candidates, including romosozumab, Parsabiv, and AMG 334, which could drive future growth.
- **Increased Guidance**: The company increased its 2016 revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance, reflecting confidence in its current and future performance.

### Challenges and Considerations
- **Access and Reimbursement Issues**: REPATHA faced significant access and reimbursement hurdles, with a high rejection rate at pharmacies due to prior authorization requirements. However, positive cardiovascular outcomes data expected later in the year could improve access.
- **Competition**: Amgen's products, such as Enbrel and NEUPOGEN, are facing increased competition, which could impact sales in the short term.
- **Regulatory and Market Dynamics**: The company is navigating complex regulatory environments and market dynamics, including potential impacts from changes in healthcare policies and pricing pressures.

### Conclusion
Given the strong financial performance, successful product launches, and a promising pipeline, the short-term outlook for Amgen's stock is generally positive. However, the challenges related to access and reimbursement for REPATHA and the competitive landscape may introduce some volatility.
