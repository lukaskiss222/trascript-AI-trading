1. **Positive Clinical Progress**: ChemoCentryx highlighted significant advancements in its clinical trials, particularly with avacopan in ANCA-associated vasculitis, Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), and C3 glomerulopathy. The completion of enrollment in the ADVOCATE trial and the initiation of the AURORA trial are major milestones that could generate positive sentiment.

2. **Upcoming Catalysts**: The company is anticipating multiple topline data readouts over the next 18 months, starting with the ADVOCATE trial in Q4 2019. Positive results from these trials could be major catalysts for the stock.
