The transcript for Amgen's first quarter 2011 financial results indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Positive Product Performance**: Amgen reported strong starts for its new products, XGEVA and Prolia, with accelerating sales growth. This is a positive indicator for the company's commercial performance.

2. **Increased Operating Expenses**: The company noted a 13% increase in operating expenses, largely due to investments in R&D, new product launches, and additional legislative costs. While this is a short-term increase, it is part of a strategic investment plan that could yield long-term benefits.

3. **Guidance Reaffirmation**: Amgen reaffirmed its 2011 guidance, with the exception of a lower adjusted tax rate due to foreign tax credits. This stability in guidance suggests that the company's overall financial outlook remains positive.

4. **Pipeline Progress**: The company highlighted progress in its R&D pipeline, including regulatory discussions and ongoing clinical trials. Positive developments in the pipeline can be a significant driver of long-term growth and investor confidence.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, driven by the strong performance of new products, continued investment in a promising pipeline, and stable guidance.
