Amgen's Q2 2022 earnings call and the announcement of the ChemoCentryx acquisition present several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Volume Driven Growth**: Amgen reported strong volume growth, with a 10% increase in unit volumes and double-digit sales growth for several key products, including Repatha, Prolia, and LUMAKRAS. This positive performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors.

2. **ChemoCentryx Acquisition**: The acquisition of ChemoCentryx and the addition of TAVNEOS to Amgen's portfolio are seen as strategic and positive, addressing a significant unmet medical need and fitting well into Amgen's inflammation and nephrology expertise. This move is expected to enhance Amgen's growth prospects.

3. **Guidance and Financial Performance**: Amgen's revised 2022 revenue and EPS guidance, although narrowing, remains within a positive range. The company's ability to navigate foreign exchange headwinds, increasing interest rates, and other macro challenges without significantly impacting guidance is a positive indicator.

4. **Pipeline and Innovation**: The progress in Amgen's pipeline, including encouraging data for LUMAKRAS, TEZSPIRE, and other molecules, suggests a robust future for the company's innovative and biosimilar products.

5. **Regulatory and Pricing Concerns**: The discussion around potential drug pricing legislation and its impact on innovation, while a concern, does not seem to immediately affect Amgen's strategy or the ChemoCentryx acquisition.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong operational performance, strategic growth through acquisition, and a robust pipeline. However, the macro environment and regulatory uncertainties might introduce some caution.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings report, the strategic acquisition, and the promising pipeline updates.
