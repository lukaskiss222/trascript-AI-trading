The transcript for ChemoCentryx's second quarter 2020 financial results and business update presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Positive Clinical Trials and Regulatory Progress**: The company has made significant progress with its lead candidate, avacopan, including the submission of an NDA to the FDA for ANCA-associated vasculitis and plans for commercialization. Positive results from the ADVOCATE trial and upcoming data from the AURORA and ACCOLADE trials could be highly positive for the stock.

- **Financial Strength**: ChemoCentryx has strengthened its balance sheet with a follow-on offering, resulting in over $0.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This financial stability provides the company with the resources needed to pursue further clinical developments and potential commercial launches.

- **Commercial Preparation**: The company is actively preparing for the commercial launch of avacopan, including hiring key personnel and conducting market research. This readiness suggests confidence in the product's future.

- **COVID-19 Impact**: While the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced some delays, particularly in the AURORA trial, the company's overall progress has been less impacted than many other biotech firms. This resilience is a positive factor.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong clinical and regulatory progress, financial stability, and preparations for commercial launch.
