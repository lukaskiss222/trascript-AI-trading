Amgen's third-quarter 2008 earnings call presented several positive and reassuring points that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key reasons:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 7% increase in total revenues to $3.9 billion, with adjusted EPS increasing by 14% to $1.23. This strong revenue and earnings growth, coupled with the raise in full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, indicates robust financial health[1%.

- **Product Performance**: The company saw significant growth in several of its key products, including Sensipar, ENBREL, and Neulasta. International sales grew by 20%, driven by strong performance in various regions[1].

- **Pipeline and R&D**: Amgen highlighted positive developments in its pipeline, particularly with denosumab and Nplate. The approval of Nplate and the promising clinical results for denosumab are significant milestones that add to the company's growth prospects[1].

- **Financial Stability and Guidance**: The company's strong cash position, reduced debt, and conservative investment portfolio management suggest a stable financial foundation. The raised guidance for 2008 revenues and adjusted EPS also indicates confidence in future performance[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial results, promising product performance, and advancing pipeline.
