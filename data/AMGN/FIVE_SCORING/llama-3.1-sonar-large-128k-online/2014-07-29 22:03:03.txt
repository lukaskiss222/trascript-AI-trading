Amgen's second-quarter earnings call presents a mix of positive and transitional elements that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

## Positive Factors
- **Revenue Growth**: Amgen reported a 20% increase in total revenues to $8.4 billion, driven by a 26% volume growth in product sales[1][2].
- **Strong Product Performance**: Several products, including Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, and TAVNEOS, delivered double-digit sales growth[1][2].
- **Pipeline Advancements**: The company is advancing its pipeline with significant milestones, such as the upcoming submissions for evolocumab and ivabradine, and positive data from various clinical trials[4].
- **Cost Discipline and Restructuring**: Amgen announced a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and reallocating resources to higher-growth areas, which should lead to $700 million in operating expense savings by 2016[4].

## Transitional and Potentially Negative Factors
- **Higher Operating Expenses**: Despite revenue growth, GAAP operating income decreased due to higher operating expenses, including amortization from the Horizon acquisition and increased R&D and SG&A expenses[1][2].
- **EPS Impact**: GAAP EPS decreased 46% primarily due to higher operating expenses, although non-GAAP EPS only decreased by 1%[1][2].
- **Restructuring Charges**: The restructuring will result in pretax accounting charges of $775 million to $950 million, primarily incurred in 2014 and 2015[4].

## Conclusion
Given the strong revenue growth, positive pipeline developments, and the company's commitment to cost discipline and strategic reallocation of resources, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. However, the immediate EPS impact and the restructuring charges might introduce some volatility.
