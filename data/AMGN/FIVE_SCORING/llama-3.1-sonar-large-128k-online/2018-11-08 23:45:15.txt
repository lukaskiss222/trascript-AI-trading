The transcript for ChemoCentryx's third quarter 2018 financial results and clinical updates presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Positive Clinical Momentum**: The company is making significant progress in its clinical trials, particularly with avacopan for ANCA-associated vasculitis, C3 Glomerulopathy, and Hidradenitis Suppurativa. The potential for multiple positive data readouts in the coming year could be a strong catalyst for the stock.
- **Financial Strength**: ChemoCentryx has a robust financial position, with approximately $186 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which will support the completion of ongoing clinical trials and preparations for commercialization.
- **Orphan Drug Designation and Commercial Potential**: The FDA's grant of orphan drug designation to CCX140 for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and the company's strategic partnerships, such as with Vifor Pharma, add to the potential commercial success of their pipeline.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short term due to the promising clinical progress, strong financial position, and significant commercial potential.
