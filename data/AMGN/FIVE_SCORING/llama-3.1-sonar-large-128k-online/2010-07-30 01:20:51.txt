The transcript for Amgen's second-quarter 2010 financial results indicates several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Solid Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 2% year-over-year increase in revenues, adjusted EPS up 7%, and a strong balance sheet with significant cash and low debt[5].

2. **Prolia Launch**: The launch of Prolia has been successful so far, with positive initial feedback from physicians and a strong start in Germany. However, the ramp-up in the U.S. is slower due to reimbursement issues[5].

3. **Health Care Reform**: Amgen has internalized the impacts of Health Care Reform and does not expect significant negative effects, with the estimated impact for 2010 remaining in the range of $200 million to $250 million[5].

4. **ESA and Other Product Performance**: Aranesp sales declined due to more conservative ESA utilization, while Enbrel and other newer products showed growth or stability despite competitive pressures[5].

5. **Pipeline and R&D**: Amgen's R&D pipeline is robust, with several promising candidates in late-stage development, including Denosumab for skeletal-related events and other oncology molecules[5].

Given these points:

- The successful launch of Prolia, despite some reimbursement challenges, and the overall solid financial performance should support the stock.
- The robust R&D pipeline and positive feedback on new products are positive indicators.
- However, the decline in Aranesp sales and competitive pressures on Enbrel might slightly offset these positives.

Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financials, successful product launches, and a promising pipeline.
