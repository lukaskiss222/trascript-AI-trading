The transcript for Amgen Inc.'s third quarter 2009 financial results call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Amgen reported strong earnings per share growth of 21% for the quarter, driven by lower operating expenses and a decreased tax rate[5>.
- The company raised its earnings guidance for the year, reflecting continued operating expense discipline and a lower tax rate[5].
- Amgen's product portfolio, excluding Aranesp, showed solid growth, with a 5% increase in US sales and a 5% increase in international sales excluding foreign exchange effects[5].
- The company made significant progress in its R&D pipeline, including positive results from several phase III studies and advancements in key products like Prolia and Vectibix[5].

### Negative Factors:
- Total revenue decreased by 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of Aranesp label changes and a stronger dollar[5].
- Aranesp sales declined significantly, down 19% worldwide, which was expected but still a notable drag on overall sales[5].
- The TREAT study results showed no significant benefit of Aranesp on cardiovascular outcomes and highlighted potential risks, such as an increased stroke rate, which could impact future sales and regulatory approvals[5].

### Management's Tone and Guidance:
- Management expressed optimism about future growth drivers, including the potential approval and launch of Prolia and the expansion of Vectibix's indications[5].
- The guidance for 2009 was revised upward, indicating confidence in the company's ability to manage costs and capitalize on growth opportunities[5].

Given these factors, the short-term impact on Amgen's stock price is likely to be positive but tempered by the mixed results and ongoing regulatory uncertainties.
