The transcript for ChemoCentryx's third quarter 2019 financial results and clinical updates suggests several key points that could impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Positive Clinical Outlook**: The company is on track to release top-line data from the pivotal ADVOCATE Phase III trial of avacopan for ANCA-associated vasculitis, which is expected in the current quarter. Positive results from this trial could significantly boost investor confidence and the stock price[4>.

2. **Multiple Data Readouts**: ChemoCentryx is expecting several data readouts in the coming year, including results from trials on avacopan for C3 glomerulopathy and hidradenitis suppurativa, as well as trials on CCX140 for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. These multiple readouts provide several potential catalysts for the stock[4].

3. **Strong Financial Position**: The company has a solid financial position with $205.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of the third quarter, which should support ongoing clinical trials and regulatory filings[4].

4. **Commercial Preparation**: ChemoCentryx is actively preparing for commercial launch, with a strong partnership with Vifor Pharma for international markets and a well-planned regulatory and marketing strategy[4].

Given these factors, the anticipation of positive clinical trial results, multiple upcoming data readouts, a strong financial position, and proactive commercial preparation, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
