Amgen's fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 earnings call presented a mixed outlook but with several positive indicators. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and EPS**: Despite a 2% decrease in fourth-quarter revenue, Amgen reported a 4% increase in full-year revenue to $14.8 billion and a 10% increase in full-year adjusted EPS to $4.29. The adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter increased by 11% to $1.00[1|.
- **Guidance for 2008**: The company provided guidance for 2008 with a revenue range of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion and adjusted EPS ranging from $4.00 to $4.30. This guidance reflects ongoing competitive, reimbursement, and regulatory risks[1|.
- **Cost Cutting and Efficiency**: Amgen successfully implemented cost-cutting measures, leading to an 8% decrease in total operating expenses in the fourth quarter. The company expects to maintain similar efficiencies in 2008[1|.
- **Pipeline and R&D**: The R&D pipeline showed strong progress, particularly with Denosumab, which outperformed Alendronate in a Phase III study. Other pipeline updates, including Vectibix and Sensipar, were also positive[1|.
- **Regulatory and Competitive Landscape**: Amgen is prepared for ongoing regulatory discussions, including the ODAC meeting in March, and is managing the impact of label changes and biosimilar competition in Europe[1].

### Short-Term Implications

Given these points, here are the short-term implications for the stock:

- **Positive EPS and Revenue Guidance**: The maintained earnings guidance and positive pipeline updates are likely to support the stock.
- **Successful Cost-Cutting**: The efficiency measures and successful restructuring efforts add to the company's stability.
- **Pipeline Potential**: The strong performance of Denosumab and other pipeline products could generate investor optimism.
- **Regulatory Risks**: While there are risks associated with the ODAC meeting and competitive pressures, Amgen's proactive approach and solid guidance mitigate some of these concerns.

### Conclusion

Considering these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's robust financial performance, successful cost-cutting measures, and promising pipeline developments.
