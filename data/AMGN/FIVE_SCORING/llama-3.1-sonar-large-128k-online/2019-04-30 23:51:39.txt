Amgen's first quarter 2019 financial results and the accompanying conference call reveal several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: Total revenues were unchanged at $5.6 billion, with a 1% decline in product sales globally, though new products like Prolia, Repatha, and Aimovig showed strong growth. GAAP EPS decreased 2%, but non-GAAP EPS increased 3% due to lower weighted-average shares outstanding[1][4][5].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company raised its 2019 revenue guidance to $22.0 billion to $22.9 billion and revised its non-GAAP EPS guidance to $13.25 to $14.30. This suggests a positive outlook despite current challenges[1][4][5].

3. **Product Performance**: Strong volume growth in newer products, successful lifecycle management of mature brands, and promising launches like Evenity and Aimovig. However, there are concerns about pricing pressures, especially for Neulasta and Sensipar[1][4][5].

4. **Pipeline and R&D**: Amgen highlighted significant progress in its pipeline, including the KRAS G12C inhibitor AMG 510, BiTE molecules, and other oncology programs. This pipeline strength could be a long-term positive factor[1][4][5].

5. **Biosimilars and Competition**: The biosimilars business is growing, but the market is competitive. Amgen is positioning itself well, especially in Europe, but faces increasing competition in the US[1][4][5].

6. **Management Tone**: The management's tone was positive, emphasizing the company's ability to grow volumes, defend mature brands, and advance a robust pipeline. They also highlighted their financial strength and commitment to returning value to shareholders[1][4][5].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the raised guidance, strong performance of newer products, and the promising pipeline. However, some short-term pressure could arise from the decreased GAAP EPS, higher operating expenses, and ongoing pricing pressures.
