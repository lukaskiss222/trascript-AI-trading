Amgenâ€™s first quarter 2018 financial results and the subsequent discussion highlight several positive and strategic elements that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 2% increase in total revenues, 3% growth in product sales, and a 10% increase in non-GAAP EPS, driven by strong unit demand for new products and a lower tax rate[1][2][5].
- **Innovative Product Pipeline**: The company is experiencing double-digit growth in new and recently launched products, including Repatha, KYPROLIS, Prolia, and XGEVA. Upcoming launches such as Aimovig for migraine prevention and biosimilars like AMGEVITA are expected to be significant growth drivers[1][2][5].
- **Positive Regulatory Developments**: Amgen received several positive regulatory decisions, including the approval of XGEVA for multiple myeloma and the upcoming FDA action date for Aimovig. These approvals are expected to enhance the company's growth prospects[5].
- **Strong Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns**: Amgen generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow and plans to repurchase an additional $2-4 billion of its shares in Q2, indicating robust financial health and commitment to shareholder value[1][2][5].
- **Optimistic Guidance**: The company revised its 2018 guidance upward, reflecting solid Q1 growth and a favorable tax outlook, which should bolster investor confidence[1][2].
