Amgen's second-quarter 2013 financial results and the subsequent discussion in the earnings call indicate several positive and some neutral to slightly negative factors that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Product Sales**: Amgen reported a 9% year-over-year increase in product sales, driven by robust performance of key products like Enbrel, Neulasta, Prolia, and XGEVA[1][2][4].
- **Increased Guidance**: The company raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in their financial performance[1][2][4].
- **Pipeline Advancements**: Positive Phase 3 data for T-Vec and trebananib, and upcoming pivotal data for AMG 145 in the first quarter of 2014, suggest a strong pipeline and potential future growth drivers[4].
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Announcements of collaborations with Astellas, Servier, and other partners strengthen Amgen's position in key markets and therapeutic areas[4].

### Neutral to Slightly Negative Factors
- **R&D Expenses**: Increased R&D expenses, particularly for late-stage clinical trials, might pressure short-term profitability, although these investments are seen as crucial for long-term growth[1][4].
- **Medicaid Adjustments and Other Revenues**: While the positive adjustment for Medicaid rebates boosted EPS, other revenues were lower due to a one-time payment recognized in the previous year[1][2].
- **Unit Declines in Some Products**: Minor declines in unit sales for Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, though largely offset by price increases and other factors, could raise some concerns about market dynamics[4].

### Conclusion
Given the strong product sales growth, raised guidance, and significant pipeline advancements, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive. However, the slight increase in R&D expenses and minor unit declines in some products introduce some caution.
