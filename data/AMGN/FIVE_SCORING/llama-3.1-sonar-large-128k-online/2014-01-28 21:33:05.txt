The transcript for Amgen Inc.'s fourth quarter and full-year 2013 financial results call presents several positive and some cautious notes that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 13% increase in revenues for the fourth quarter and an 8% increase for the full year, with adjusted EPS growing by 30% and 17%, respectively. This strong financial execution is likely to be viewed positively by investors[2][3].
- **Pipeline Advancements**: The company highlighted significant advancements in its pipeline, including data from pivotal studies for evolocumab and progress in other key programs such as Kyprolis, T-VEC, and biosimilars. These advancements suggest potential long-term growth opportunities[2][3].
- **International Expansion**: Amgen made notable progress in expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in Japan, China, and emerging markets, which is expected to drive future growth[2][3].

### Cautious Notes:
- **Guidance and Competitive Headwinds**: The 2014 revenue guidance was slightly below consensus expectations, and the company noted potential competitive pressures, especially in the filgrastim portfolio and from other competitors like Bristol and AbbVie in the multiple myeloma market. This could lead to some investor caution[2][3].
- **Operating Expenses**: While operating income is expected to grow, the company noted increased R&D expenses and SG&A costs due to the Onyx acquisition and other factors, which might temper some of the enthusiasm[2][3].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance, significant pipeline advancements, and international expansion, these positive factors are likely to outweigh the cautious notes in the short term. However, the slightly below-consensus guidance and expected competitive pressures might prevent a strong rally.
