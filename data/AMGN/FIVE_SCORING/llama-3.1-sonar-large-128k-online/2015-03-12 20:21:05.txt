The transcript for ChemoCentryx Inc.'s fourth quarter 2014 financial results and corporate update presents several key points that could influence the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Positive Clinical Trial Results**: The company reported positive Phase II clinical results for CCX140 in diabetic nephropathy, showing statistically significant improvements in urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This is a significant positive indicator for the stock.

2. **Expanding Clinical Programs**: ChemoCentryx is advancing its CCR2 inhibitor program into oncology with CCX872, and its complement C5a receptor inhibitor program, CCX168, is progressing well in various indications, including ANCA-associated vasculitis and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). These expansions suggest potential future growth and value creation.

3. **Regulatory Milestones**: The company achieved important regulatory designations, such as Orphan-Drug Designation for CCX168 for aHUS, which can facilitate faster regulatory pathways and enhance market potential.

4. **Financial Guidance**: The financial guidance indicates ongoing investment in clinical trials but also a manageable cash utilization projection, suggesting that the company is well-positioned financially to pursue its development plans.

Given these points, the positive clinical trial results, expanding clinical programs, and regulatory milestones are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
