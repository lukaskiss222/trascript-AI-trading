Amgen's Q4 and full-year 2009 earnings transcript presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Factors
- Amgen reported an 8% increase in full-year 2009 adjusted EPS to $4.91, and a 20% increase in GAAP EPS to $4.51, indicating strong earnings growth[1].
- The company generated $6.3 billion in operating cash flow, a 6% increase over 2008, and ended the year with a strong balance sheet and $13.4 billion in cash[1].
- Amgen is poised to launch Prolia worldwide, with a positive opinion from the CHMP for EU approval and ongoing discussions with the FDA, which could be a significant growth driver[1].
- The pipeline is advancing with multiple Phase 3 studies and new drug candidates, including promising data on denosumab and Vectibix[1].

## Neutral to Negative Factors
- Total revenue for 2009 decreased by 2% to $14.6 billion, primarily due to the impact of Aranesp label changes and a stronger dollar in the first three quarters[1].
- There are uncertainties around healthcare reform and its potential financial impact, although Amgen has not included these estimates in their 2010 guidance[1].
- The company expects increased expenses related to the launch of Prolia, including higher sales and marketing costs, which could temporarily impact margins[1].
- Regulatory uncertainties, such as the REMS program and potential further labeling changes for ESAs, could impact Aranesp sales and overall anemia management practices[1].

## Conclusion
Given the strong earnings growth, robust cash generation, and promising pipeline developments, particularly the imminent launch of Prolia, the overall sentiment is positive. However, the revenue decline in 2009 and ongoing regulatory uncertainties might temper short-term enthusiasm.
