Amgen's first quarter 2024 earnings call highlighted several positive and some mixed elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Revenue Growth**: Total revenues increased by 22% to $7.4 billion, driven by a 25% volume growth, with several key products such as Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, and TAVNEOS showing significant year-over-year growth[1][3][4>.
- **Pipeline Advancements**: Amgen is making notable progress in its pipeline, including promising results for MariTide in obesity, tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, and other Phase III trials. The integration of Horizon Therapeutics is also proceeding well[1][3][4].
- **Expansions and Approvals**: The company is expanding its market reach with products like TEPEZZA, UPLIZNA, and TEZSPIRE, and is anticipating key approvals and data readouts in the coming months[1][3][4].

### Mixed Factors:
- **Non-GAAP EPS**: While non-GAAP operating income increased, non-GAAP EPS decreased by 1% due to higher operating and interest expenses related to the Horizon acquisition[1][3][4].
- **Operating Margin**: Non-GAAP operating margin decreased by 5.1 percentage points to 43.2%, and GAAP operating margin decreased significantly due to higher amortization and operating expenses[1][3][4].
- **Free Cash Flow**: Free cash flow decreased to $0.5 billion from $0.7 billion, primarily due to a planned tax deposit[1][3][4].

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong revenue growth, impressive pipeline advancements, and ongoing integration of Horizon Therapeutics, these positive factors are likely to outweigh the short-term negative impacts from decreased non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The market is likely to react positively to the company's overall performance and future growth potential.
