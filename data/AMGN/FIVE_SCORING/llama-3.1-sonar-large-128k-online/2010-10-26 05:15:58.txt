The transcript for Amgen's third quarter 2010 financial results call provides several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and EPS Guidance**: Amgen reaffirmed its full-year revenue guidance slightly below $15.1 billion and adjusted EPS towards the lower end of $5.05 to $5.25. This stability in guidance is generally positive[3].

2. **Prolia Launch**: The launch of Prolia is progressing, although at a slower pace than expected due to reimbursement complexities. However, management remains confident in the product's long-term potential, especially with upcoming formulary decisions and the expansion of Medicare Part D coverage. This slow but optimistic progress might maintain current investor sentiment rather than causing significant short-term volatility[3].

3. **R&D and Pipeline Updates**: Positive updates on Denosumab, the AMG 147 study, and other pipeline developments suggest a robust R&D pipeline, which can be a long-term positive but may not have an immediate impact on the stock price.

4. **Operational Costs and Tax Rate**: The increase in R&D costs and a higher tax rate compared to the previous year's quarter are noted, but these are explained as part of normal operating patterns and tax rate normalization. This transparency helps manage expectations and may not lead to significant short-term stock price movements[3].

5. **Cash Utilization and Strategic Plans**: Amgen's accumulation of cash and plans for potential acquisitions or strategic investments could be seen as positive for long-term growth, but this does not typically drive short-term stock price changes.

Given these points, the overall impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks is likely to be neutral. The company's solid financial performance, reassuring guidance, and positive pipeline updates balance out the slower-than-expected uptake of Prolia and the operational cost increases.
