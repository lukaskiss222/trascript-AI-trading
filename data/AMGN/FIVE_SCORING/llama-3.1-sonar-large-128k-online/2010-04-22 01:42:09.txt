Amgen's first quarter 2010 earnings call presents a mixed outlook with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- Amgen reported a 9% increase in revenues and a 20% increase in adjusted EPS, indicating strong financial performance for the quarter[4].
- The company saw robust growth in international sales, up 16% year-over-year, and strong performance from key products like Neulasta, EPOGEN, and Sensipar[4].
- The upcoming launch of Prolia and the positive clinical results for denosumab are significant positives, with potential for future revenue growth[4].

### Negative Factors:
- The impact of healthcare reform is expected to be significant, with estimated costs of $200 million to $250 million for 2010 and increasing costs in subsequent years. This could pressure margins and profitability[4].
- Aranesp sales were down 8% in the U.S., and the company anticipates further decline due to more conservative use of ESAs and regulatory developments[4].
- Operating expenses are expected to increase in the second half of the year, particularly due to the launch of Prolia, which could affect EPS growth[4].

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance in the first quarter but the looming costs and challenges associated with healthcare reform, the stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure. However, the positive outlook on new product launches and international growth mitigates some of this risk.
