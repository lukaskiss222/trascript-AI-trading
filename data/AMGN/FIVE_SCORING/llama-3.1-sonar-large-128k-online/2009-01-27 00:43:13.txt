The transcript for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 financial results presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for the company. Here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price:

- **Financial Performance**: Amgen delivered on its financial promises, with adjusted EPS increasing by 6% for the year and full-year revenues increasing by 2% to $15 billion. The company also generated strong cash flow from operations, improving by $600 million compared to 2007[4>.
- **Guidance for 2009**: The company provided guidance that suggests modest revenue growth ($14.8 to $15.2 billion) and adjusted EPS growth ($4.55 to $4.75). This guidance incorporates the expected impact of label changes and reimbursement changes for Aranesp[4].
- **Product Performance**: While Aranesp sales declined significantly due to label and reimbursement changes, other products like Enbrel, Neulasta, and Sensipar showed strong growth. The company is also preparing for the launch of Denosumab, which is expected to be a significant growth driver[4].
- **Operational Efficiency**: Amgen emphasized its focus on cost-cutting measures and operational efficiencies, particularly in G&A expenses, to support investments in Denosumab and the pipeline[4].
- **Pipeline and R&D**: The company highlighted several key clinical trials and pipeline developments, including Denosumab, which is expected to be a major contributor to future growth. The pipeline updates were generally positive and suggest a robust future for Amgenâ€™s R&D efforts[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the transcript is positive, with a focus on continued growth, operational efficiency, and a strong pipeline. However, the immediate impact of declining Aranesp sales and the uncertainty around future biosimilar competition might introduce some short-term volatility.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's solid financial performance, positive guidance, and promising pipeline developments, despite some short-term challenges.
