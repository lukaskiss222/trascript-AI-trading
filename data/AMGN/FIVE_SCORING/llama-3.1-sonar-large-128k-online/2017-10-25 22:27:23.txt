The transcript for Amgen's Q3 2017 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported solid financial results, including flat year-over-year revenues and a 5% increase in non-GAAP EPS. This indicates stable financial health and effective management of costs despite challenges like Hurricane Maria.

2. **Product Performance and Pipeline**: The company highlighted strong volume growth for newer products like Prolia, Repatha, KYPROLIS, and BLINCYTO, which offsets declines in mature brands. The pipeline is robust, with significant developments in cardiovascular, oncology, and migraine treatments. Positive outcomes from these areas could boost investor confidence.

3. **Biosimilars and Competitive Position**: Amgen's success in biosimilars, particularly with MVASI and AMGEVITA, positions the company well in a competitive market. The company's biologics development and manufacturing expertise are seen as key differentiators.

4. **Hurricane Maria Impact**: Although the hurricane caused some disruptions and expenses, Amgen's manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico have largely resumed, and there is no expected significant impact on 2018 results. This swift recovery is a positive sign.

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: Amgen raised its 2017 earnings outlook and expects continued investment in growth areas, which suggests a positive outlook for the remainder of the year and into 2018.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial performance, robust pipeline, and effective management of challenges.
