The transcript from Amgen's Q1 2007 earnings call presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could impact the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 15% increase in revenue and a 19% increase in adjusted EPS, driven by strong demand for key products like Aranesp, ENBREL, and Neulasta/NEUPOGEN[4|.
- **International Growth**: International sales were up 22%, positively impacted by foreign exchange[4|.
- **Pipeline Progress**: The company highlighted positive results from studies on denosumab, AMG 531, and other pipeline products, which could support long-term growth[4|.
- **Cost Management**: Amgen is taking steps to reduce operating expense growth to offset potential revenue decreases, which could help maintain EPS guidance[4].

### Negative Factors:
- **ESA Safety Concerns**: The company faced challenges related to the safety and usage of its erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs), particularly Aranesp and EPOGEN, following recent study results and FDA label changes. This has led to uncertainty in the anemia market and potential reductions in ESA usage[4|.
- **Revenue Guidance Uncertainty**: The company indicated that revenue guidance is under review due to the impact of recent label changes and reimbursement modifications, which introduces uncertainty for the remainder of 2007[4|.
- **Clinical Trial Outcomes**: The PACCE study results were disappointing, and while the 145 study was neutral on survival, it did not meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a survival benefit[4!.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Amgen's stock is likely to be influenced by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding ESA usage, the potential for revised revenue guidance, and the mixed results from clinical trials.

### Conclusion:
The stock may experience some short-term pressure due to the uncertainties and challenges outlined, particularly around the ESA products and the impact of label changes. However, the company's strong financial performance, pipeline progress, and cost management efforts provide some mitigating factors.
