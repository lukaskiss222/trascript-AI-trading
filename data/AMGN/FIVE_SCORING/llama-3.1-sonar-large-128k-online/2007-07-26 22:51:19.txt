The transcript for Amgen's Second Quarter 2007 Financial Results Conference Call reveals several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the company's stock price:

1. **Challenges in the Anemia Franchise**: The company is facing significant challenges in its anemia franchise, including a 6% decline in product sales, largely due to label and reimbursement changes. This has led to a reduction in physician prescribing and dosing conservatism, particularly in the U.S.[1,.

2. **Guidance and Uncertainties**: Amgen's guidance for 2007 remains at the lower end of the original range, and the company is cautious about future revenue due to upcoming events such as the National Coverage Decision (NCD) and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee (CRDAC) meeting. These events could significantly impact the anemia business[1,.

3. **Positive Pipeline Developments**: Despite the challenges, Amgen's pipeline is showing promising results, particularly with denosumab, which met all endpoints in a Phase 3 study. Other pipeline products like Vectibix and motesanib diphosphate are also progressing well[1,.

4. **Cost Management and Share Buyback**: The company has been managing its cost base effectively and has a robust share buyback program in place, which could support the stock price. However, further cost-cutting measures may be necessary depending on future revenue trends[1,.

5. **Tax Rate and Financial Performance**: The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was favorable, and the company reported adjusted EPS growth of 7%. However, GAAP EPS was lower due to asset impairment charges[1,.

Given these points:

- The immediate challenges in the anemia franchise and the uncertainty around upcoming regulatory decisions could put short-term pressure on the stock.
- The positive pipeline developments and effective cost management might mitigate some of this pressure but are unlikely to fully offset the near-term risks.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, regulatory uncertainties, and challenges in the anemia franchise, despite the positive pipeline developments and cost management efforts.
