The transcript for Amgen's second quarter 2008 financial results call presents several positive and noteworthy developments that are likely to have a favorable impact on the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported a 1% increase in revenues and a 2% increase in adjusted EPS, exceeding expectations. The company also raised its revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2008, indicating strong sales momentum and lower operating expenses[1][2].

2. **Positive Clinical Data**: The company announced highly favorable clinical data for denosumab, particularly in postmenopausal osteoporosis and in men with androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. This data exceeded expectations and is seen as a significant positive for the company's future growth prospects[1][2].

3. **Cost Management and Efficiency**: Amgen highlighted successful cost management efforts, including reduced capital expenditures and increased free cash flow, which are seen as positive indicators of the company's ability to manage expenses while investing in R&D[1].

4. **Pipeline Advancements**: The progress in Amgen's pipeline, particularly with denosumab and Nplate, and the positive interactions with the FDA regarding these products, add to the company's growth potential[1][2].

5. **Market and Competitive Positioning**: Amgen's products, such as ENBREL and Neulasta, continued to perform well, and the company maintained its market share despite competitive pressures. The strong performance in Europe, especially against biosimilar competition, is another positive factor[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong financials, promising clinical data, and effective cost management. These factors are likely to boost investor confidence and drive the stock price upward in the short term.
