The transcript for Amgen's first quarter 2009 financial results call highlights several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Revenue and Guidance**: Amgen reported an 8% decline in revenue for the first quarter, largely due to factors such as Enbrel inventory adjustments, foreign exchange impacts, and product divestitures. Despite this, the company maintained its adjusted EPS guidance of $4.55 to $4.75 but lowered its total revenue guidance to $14.4 to $14.8 billion[4].

2. **Macro-Economic Impact**: The economic environment significantly affected patient behavior, leading to postponed doctor visits, reduced adherence to medication regimens, and higher co-pays, particularly impacting Enbrel sales. However, the company is taking aggressive cost-cutting measures to mitigate these effects[4].

3. **Product Performance**: Enbrel and Aranesp faced significant declines, while other products like EPOGEN and Sensipar showed some resilience. International sales were strong, especially excluding foreign exchange impacts[4].

4. **Pipeline and Future Outlook**: The pipeline remains promising, with denosumab progressing well and expected to launch in osteoporosis and other indications later in the year. This could provide a positive outlook for future revenue growth[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the reduced revenue guidance, significant sales declines in key products like Enbrel and Aranesp, and the ongoing economic pressures. However, the maintained EPS guidance and positive pipeline developments may help mitigate some of the negative sentiment.
