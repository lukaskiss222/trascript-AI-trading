Amgen's Q3 2022 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Volume Growth and Revenue**: Despite a 1% decline in total revenues due to lower net selling prices and foreign exchange impacts, Amgen reported an 8% volume growth globally, with 11 products achieving record quarterly sales. This strong underlying demand for their medicines is a positive indicator[1][3][4].

2. **Guidance and Financial Performance**: The company updated its 2022 guidance, expecting total revenues between $26.0 billion and $26.3 billion, and non-GAAP EPS between $17.25 and $17.85. The free cash flow of $2.8 billion for the quarter is also a strong financial metric[1][3].

3. **New Product Launches and Pipeline**: Amgen highlighted the successful launch of new products such as TEZSPIRE, LUMAKRAS, and the recent acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which adds TAVNEOS to their portfolio. These launches and pipeline advancements indicate future growth potential[1][3].

4. **Biosimilars and Competitive Landscape**: Amgen is preparing for the launch of several biosimilars, including AMGEVITA, which will be the first biosimilar to HUMIRA in the U.S. market. While there are concerns about pricing dynamics, the company's strategy to launch successive new biosimilars is expected to drive long-term growth[1][3].

5. **Macroeconomic and Industry Challenges**: Despite challenges such as foreign exchange headwinds, higher interest rates, and the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, Amgen has executed well and remains confident in its long-term growth prospects[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong volume growth, successful product launches, and a robust pipeline. However, short-term pressures from forex impacts and pricing dynamics in the biosimilars segment might temper immediate gains.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong volume growth, updated guidance, and the company's strategic advancements.
