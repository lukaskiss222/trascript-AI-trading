Amgen's first quarter 2015 earnings call highlights several positive factors that are likely to have a short-term positive impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported an 11% increase in revenues to $5 billion and a 33% increase in adjusted EPS to $2.48, driven by solid product sales growth across the portfolio, including significant increases in sales of Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, and Enbrel[5].

2. **Raised Guidance**: The company raised its 2015 revenue and earnings guidance, indicating continued confidence in its strategy and strong performance[5].

3. **New Product Launches**: Successful launches of new products such as BLINCYTO, the Neulasta on-body injector, and the recent approval of Corlanor, along with preparations for the launch of Repatha later in the year, suggest robust commercial execution and growth potential[5].

4. **Pipeline Progress**: Amgen reported positive results from several Phase 3 studies, including those for Kyprolis and its biosimilar adalimumab, which bodes well for future growth[5].

5. **Cost Savings and Efficiency**: The company's transformation initiatives have delivered significant cost savings, which are expected to continue throughout the year, contributing to improved margins and financial performance[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings, raised guidance, successful product launches, and promising pipeline developments.
