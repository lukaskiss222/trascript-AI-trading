The transcript for Amgen's Q4 and full-year 2011 financial results and guidance for 2012 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Amgen reported solid revenue growth, with product sales increasing by 4% for the full year, and adjusted EPS growing by 2%. This positive financial performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors[5].

2. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided guidance for 2012, expecting revenues between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion and adjusted EPS between $5.90 and $6.15. This guidance suggests continued growth and stability, which is generally positive for investor sentiment[5].

3. **Product Performance**: Key products like Neulasta, Enbrel, Prolia, and XGEVA showed strong growth, and the company is optimistic about their continued performance in 2012. This is a positive indicator for the stock[5].

4. **Strategic Acquisitions and Pipeline**: The acquisition of Micromet and the development of promising pipeline candidates, such as blinatumomab and AMG 785, indicate a strong commitment to innovation and growth. This can be seen as a positive long-term strategy but may also reflect well in the short term due to the excitement around new therapeutic opportunities[5].

5. **Leadership Transition**: The transition in leadership from Kevin Sharer to Robert Bradway is described as seamless and generational, which suggests stability and continuity in the company's strategy. This stability is likely to reassure investors[5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, robust product growth, and a promising pipeline. These factors are likely to support the stock price in the short term.
