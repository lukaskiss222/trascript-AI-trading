Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key concerns include:

1. Significant decline in anemia drug franchise sales (Aranesp down 10%, driven by 19% decline in US) due to safety/reimbursement concerns
2. Uncertainty around upcoming National Coverage Decision (NCD) impact in mid-August
3. Conservative guidance maintained at lower end ($4.30) of original range, with additional $0.02 dilution from acquisitions
4. Multiple near-term regulatory/reimbursement risks outlined for both Aranesp and Epogen

While there were some positives (Enbrel growth, pipeline progress), the immediate headwinds facing their core anemia business and upcoming NCD decision are likely to pressure the stock in the short-term.
