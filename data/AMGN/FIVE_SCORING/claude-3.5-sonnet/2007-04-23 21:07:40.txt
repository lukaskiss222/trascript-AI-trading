Based on the earnings call transcript, I see mixed near-term signals for Amgen. The negatives include uncertainty around ESA (Aranesp/EPOGEN) revenue due to label changes and reimbursement issues, withdrawn revenue guidance, and reduced expense growth. However, there are several positives: strong Q1 results with 15% revenue growth, encouraging Phase III data for denosumab, management's confidence in hitting the low end of EPS guidance through cost controls, and continued pipeline progress. The neutral survival data from Study 145 reduces some safety concerns but is unlikely to drive near-term growth. Given the uncertainty around ESA sales which represent a significant portion of revenue, but balanced by strong underlying business performance and cost management, I expect a modestly negative short-term impact.
