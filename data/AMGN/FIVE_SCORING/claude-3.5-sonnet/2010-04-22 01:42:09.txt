Based on my analysis of the Q1 2010 earnings call, here are the key takeaways that would impact the stock in the next 1-2 weeks:

Positive factors:
- Revenue grew 9% YoY with solid performance across most products
- EPS grew 20% YoY to $1.30
- Strong international growth of 16%
- Optimistic outlook on Prolia approval and launch
- Maintained full year guidance despite healthcare reform impact

Negative factors:
- Healthcare reform will impact 2010 revenues by $200-250M
- Guided to low end of revenue/EPS ranges due to reform costs
- Operating expenses expected to ramp up significantly for Prolia launch
- Some pricing pressure in Europe
- Aranesp sales declining in US

Overall, while there are some near-term headwinds from healthcare reform and rising costs, the company demonstrated solid execution and maintained guidance despite these challenges. The positive momentum in the base business and optimism around Prolia should outweigh the known negative impacts.

Rating: [1] (Positive impact expected on stock in next 1-2 weeks)
