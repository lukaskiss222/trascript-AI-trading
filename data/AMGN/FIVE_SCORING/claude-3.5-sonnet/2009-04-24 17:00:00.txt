Based on the earnings call transcript, I would provide a mildly positive outlook for Amgen's stock over the next 1-2 weeks. While Q1 revenues declined 8% and guidance was lowered, management exhibited strong cost control and maintained EPS guidance. Key positives include:

- Maintained full year EPS guidance despite revenue challenges through cost management
- International business performing well with 7% growth ex-FX
- Pipeline progress with denosumab on track for approval
- Strong balance sheet with $10.4B cash
- Management appears to have good handle on inventory/distribution issues

However, there are near-term headwinds:
- Economic pressures affecting Enbrel demand
- Inventory destocking impact
- Lower revenue guidance
- Uncertainty around ESA REMS implementation

Given maintained earnings guidance, pipeline progress and management's proactive cost controls balanced against near-term revenue pressures, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction.
