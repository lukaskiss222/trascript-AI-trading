Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While management expressed confidence in meeting full-year guidance, there are several concerning factors: continued Aranesp sales decline (~4% quarter-over-quarter), potential further label restrictions following FDA discussions, increased competition for ENBREL, and delayed visibility on key pipeline products like denosumab. However, these negatives are partially offset by stable cost control, strong ENBREL growth (14% excluding distribution changes), and management's detailed explanations of their revenue projections.
