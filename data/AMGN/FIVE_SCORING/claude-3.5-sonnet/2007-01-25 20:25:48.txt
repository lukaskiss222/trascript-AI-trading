Based on the Q4 2006 earnings call, Amgen presents a mixed outlook for the next 1-2 weeks. While Q4 results were strong with 17% revenue growth and successful Vectibix launch, several concerning factors emerged. The negative Aranesp trial results in anemia of cancer patients, potential label changes, and conservative 2007 guidance of 8-12% revenue growth (down from 17% in Q4) suggest near-term headwinds. However, these are partially offset by strong product momentum across the portfolio and management's confident tone regarding competitive readiness. The 1-2 week impact is likely to be modestly negative as investors digest the more conservative outlook and clinical setback.
