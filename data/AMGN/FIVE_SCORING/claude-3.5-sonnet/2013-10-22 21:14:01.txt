Based on my analysis of this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positive factors:
- Strong Q3 results with revenue up 10% and EPS up 16% 
- Raised full year guidance for both revenue and EPS
- Successfully closed Onyx acquisition which expands oncology portfolio
- Made progress on international expansion in key markets like Japan and China
- Strong performance across core products like Enbrel, Prolia, and Neulasta

Slight concerns:
- Some uncertainty around Kyprolis sales growth in near-term
- Changes to Trebananib development program 
- Integration costs from Onyx acquisition in short-term

Overall, the strong quarterly performance, raised guidance, and strategic progress outweigh the minor concerns. Management projected confidence in their growth strategy and execution.
