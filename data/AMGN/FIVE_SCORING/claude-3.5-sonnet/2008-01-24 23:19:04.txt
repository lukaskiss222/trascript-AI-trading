Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company maintained its market leadership and showed some resilience in managing costs, there are several concerning factors: guidance for 2008 was cautious ($14.2-14.6B revenue, $4.00-4.30 EPS), ongoing ESA safety/regulatory concerns ahead of an ODAC meeting, and pressure on key franchises from biosimilar competition and potential label changes. The management team appeared defensive about near-term challenges while emphasizing longer-term pipeline potential.
