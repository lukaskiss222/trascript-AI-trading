Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q2 performance with 9% product sales growth and raised full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS

2. Solid momentum in core products like Enbrel and Neulasta, plus continued growth of newer products Prolia and XGEVA

3. Pipeline progress, particularly with AMG145 (PCSK9 inhibitor) data expected in Q1 2014 and positive Phase 3 data from other programs

While there are some minor concerns around biosimilar competition and R&D spending levels, the overall tone was confident and the fundamentals appear strong with multiple growth drivers intact.
