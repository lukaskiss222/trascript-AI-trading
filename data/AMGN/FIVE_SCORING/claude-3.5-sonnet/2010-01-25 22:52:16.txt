Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Return to top-line growth projected for 2010 with revenue guidance of $15.1-15.5B
2. Strong pipeline progress with multiple late-stage catalysts expected in 2010, particularly around Prolia
3. Solid Q4 results with international growth and cost controls helping offset U.S. pressures
4. Management's confident outlook on reaching "top quartile" industry performance

Some offsetting concerns include ESA market uncertainties and timing of Prolia approval, but these appear manageable near-term. The overall tone was constructive with multiple growth drivers highlighted.
