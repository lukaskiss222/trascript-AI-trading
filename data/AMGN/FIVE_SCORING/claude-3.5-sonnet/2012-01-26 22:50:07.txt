Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q4 performance and momentum going into 2012, with record quarterly and annual sales
2. Strategic acquisition of Micromet which adds promising oncology assets and technology platform
3. Positive commentary around stabilization of ESA business and growth in newer products like XGEVA/Prolia
4. Smooth leadership transition process with experienced team

While there are some minor concerns around Aranesp trends and near-term costs from the Micromet acquisition, the overall tone was confident and forward-looking, with solid 2012 guidance and multiple growth drivers highlighted.
