Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include: strong Q3 results with 15% revenue growth and 22% EPS growth, raised full-year guidance, successful launch of new cancer drug Vectibix, strategic agreement with Fresenius for EPO products, and confident tone regarding defense of intellectual property. While there are some concerns around Enbrel growth and FDA questions on Aranesp dosing, the overall financial performance and business momentum appear strong.
