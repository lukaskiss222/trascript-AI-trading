Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with 13% revenue growth and 34% adjusted EPS growth, beating expectations and leading to raised full-year guidance

2. Solid commercial execution across major products including Enbrel, XGEVA/Prolia, with stabilization in key franchises like EPOGEN

3. Multiple positive pipeline developments including compelling Phase II data for PCSK9 inhibitor (AMG 145) and advancement of other key programs

4. Healthy balance sheet with successful debt offering and continued commitment to returning capital through dividends and buybacks

The management team projected confidence in both near-term execution and long-term growth prospects while demonstrating disciplined cost management and investment prioritization.
