Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that the short-term stock impact will likely be modestly positive. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong points:
- Solid Q4 results with revenue up 1% and adjusted EPS up 11%
- Launch of two major new products (Prolia and XGEVA) showing early promise
- Strategic acquisition of BioVex demonstrates pipeline investment
- Strong cash position ($17.4B) and continued share buybacks

2. Concerns:
- EPO/Aranesp franchise facing some pressure from healthcare reform
- Higher R&D spending planned for 2011
- Conservative 2011 guidance reflecting healthcare reform impact

The management team projected confidence while being transparent about challenges. The launch momentum of new products and pipeline developments help offset near-term headwinds from healthcare reform impacts on core franchises. While not dramatically positive, the overall tone and results suggest modest upside potential in the coming weeks.
