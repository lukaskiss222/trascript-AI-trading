Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly negative short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positive factors:
- Base business continues to perform solidly
- Prolia launch is making steady progress, though slower than ideal
- Pipeline continues to advance with upcoming catalysts

Negative factors:
- Operating expenses increased vs prior year
- ESA franchise facing pressure from REMS program and bundling changes
- Prolia uptake is slower than some investors may have hoped, with reimbursement challenges
- Net income declined 14% while revenues were flat

The overall tone suggests stable core business but near-term headwinds from increased costs and slower-than-expected Prolia ramp. While long-term prospects remain solid, the next few weeks may see modest pressure as investors digest the slower Prolia trajectory and increased expenses.
