Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis and recommendation for Amgen's likely stock movement over the next 1-2 weeks:

Key Positives:
- Solid Q2 results with EPS growing 7% YoY
- Prolia launch progressing as planned, though early days
- FDA granted priority review for Denosumab in cancer indication
- Strong pipeline progress with multiple late-stage programs
- Maintained full-year EPS guidance

Key Negatives:
- Reduced full-year revenue guidance slightly due to FX headwinds
- Core products like Aranesp (-13% YoY) and Enbrel (-2% YoY) declining
- Prolia launch expected to ramp slowly due to reimbursement dynamics
- Uncertainty around bundling impact on ESA business
- Increased competition across portfolio

Overall Analysis:
While Q2 results were decent and the Prolia launch is off to a reasonable start, there are multiple headwinds facing Amgen's core franchises and near-term growth drivers appear limited. The reduced revenue guidance, albeit mainly FX-driven, may weigh on sentiment. The stock is likely to be range-bound to slightly negative over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest these mixed signals.

Rating: [-1]
