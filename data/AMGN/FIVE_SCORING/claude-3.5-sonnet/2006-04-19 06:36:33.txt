Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a moderately positive impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include strong Q1 results with 14% revenue growth and 26% EPS growth, raised full-year guidance including Abgenix acquisition impact, and continued momentum in core products like Aranesp. While there are some concerns around Enbrel growth slowdown and complexity around ongoing Roche litigation, the overall tone was confident with strong pipeline progress and management expressing optimism about growth opportunities. The guidance raise suggests management sees continued strength ahead.
