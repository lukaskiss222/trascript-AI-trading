Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company provided solid 2009 guidance showing continued EPS growth of 0-4% despite a challenging environment, demonstrating operational discipline and cost control.

2. Management expressed high confidence in the Denosumab launch preparations and pipeline progress, with multiple data readouts expected in 2009.

3. The company showed resilience in maintaining market share against biosimilar competition in Europe and demonstrated flexibility in managing expenses while investing for growth.

While there are some headwinds from Aranesp sales declines, the overall tone was constructive with management effectively addressing key concerns around expenses, cash deployment, and commercial execution.
