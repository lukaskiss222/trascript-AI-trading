Based on the earnings call transcript, Amgen demonstrated strong overall performance with several positive indicators:

Key Positives:
- 8% product sales growth year-over-year
- Guidance raised to upper end of range for both revenues and EPS
- Strong growth in key franchises like Enbrel (9%) and Filgrastim (15%)
- Successful launches of new products XGEVA and Prolia showing momentum
- EPOGEN sales stabilizing after initial decline

Minor Concerns:
- Some R&D cost increases, though expected to moderate in second half
- ESA label changes and QIP proposal creating some uncertainty
- Increased competitive pressures in some markets

Overall Assessment:
The company showed robust performance across most business segments and expressed confidence in their outlook, raising guidance. Management appeared to have good visibility into key challenges and clear strategies to address them. The stabilization of EPOGEN and strong growth in newer products suggests positive momentum.

Based on the overwhelmingly positive indicators, strong management confidence, and raised guidance, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
