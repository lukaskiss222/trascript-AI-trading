Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that Amgen delivered strong Q4 and full-year 2013 results, with encouraging 2014 guidance and multiple potential catalysts ahead. Key positives include:

- Q4 revenues up 13% and EPS up 30%
- Strong performance across product portfolio and geographies
- Significant pipeline progress with 10 late-stage molecules
- Multiple important data readouts expected in 2014
- $800M operating income boost from full Enbrel ownership
- Solid 2014 guidance with continued growth expected

While there are some competitive challenges ahead, management expressed confidence in their growth outlook and pipeline potential. The extensive discussion of promising pipeline assets like evolocumab (PCSK9) suggests significant future opportunities.

The overall tone was quite positive, with management demonstrating strong execution and multiple growth drivers ahead.
