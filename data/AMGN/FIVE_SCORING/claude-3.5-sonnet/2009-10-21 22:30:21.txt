Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a slightly negative short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Negatives:
- Complete response letter received from FDA for Prolia, delaying approval and requiring additional information
- Concerning TREAT study results showing increased stroke risk and cancer mortality concerns with Aranesp
- Label changes and potential restrictions likely coming for Aranesp based on TREAT data
- International sales impacted by foreign exchange headwinds

Positives:
- Strong Q3 earnings, beating expectations
- Raised full year guidance
- Solid performance from core products excluding Aranesp
- Pipeline progress with several Phase 3 readouts coming

However, the regulatory setbacks for key growth driver Prolia and safety concerns with major product Aranesp are likely to outweigh the solid financial performance in the short term. The uncertainties around these issues will likely pressure the stock until there is more clarity.
