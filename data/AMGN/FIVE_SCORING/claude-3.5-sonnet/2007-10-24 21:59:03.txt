Based on the earnings transcript, I assess that Amgen faces mixed short-term prospects but tilts slightly positive. Key positives include: successful cost management and restructuring efforts, strong ENBREL sales growth (+16%), positive denosumab trial data, and maintained 2007 guidance. However, there are challenges with declining Aranesp sales (-23%) due to safety/reimbursement issues and competitive pressures in some segments. Management demonstrated a balanced and realistic tone while highlighting progress on strategic initiatives. The company appears to be effectively managing through near-term headwinds while maintaining investment in future growth drivers.
