Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q3 performance with 7% revenue growth and 14% EPS growth, leading management to raise both revenue and EPS guidance for 2008.

2. Robust balance sheet with $9.8B in cash and conservative investment portfolio insulating them from market turbulence.

3. Management expressed high confidence in their product portfolio and pipeline, particularly around denosumab's potential.

Minor concerns exist around Aranesp sales declines and increased competition, but these appear well managed and already priced into expectations. The overall tone was quite optimistic with management emphasizing their strong positioning and growth prospects.
