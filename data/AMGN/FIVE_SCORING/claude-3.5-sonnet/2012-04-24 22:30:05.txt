Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q1 results with record revenues and adjusted EPS, beating expectations
2. Broad-based growth across product portfolio, particularly in Neulasta, Enbrel, and newer products
3. Smooth leadership transition and clear strategic vision from new CEO
4. Pipeline progress and promising data from key programs
5. International expansion plans provide growth runway

While there are some concerns around ESA franchise declines and competition, these appear largely priced in and the overall tone was confident with strong execution across core franchises.

The management team demonstrated clear command of the business and provided tangible evidence of commercial momentum. The combination of better-than-expected Q1 results and positive forward-looking commentary should drive positive sentiment in the near-term.
