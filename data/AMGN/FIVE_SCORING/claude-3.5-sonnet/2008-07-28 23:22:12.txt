Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess that the short-term stock impact will be positive. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong quarterly performance and raised guidance: Company beat expectations and raised both revenue and EPS guidance for 2008, showing business stability after recent challenges.

2. Extremely positive denosumab data: Management expressed high confidence in the Phase 3 osteoporosis results, describing them as exceeding expectations, which opens up a major new market opportunity.

3. Cost management: Company demonstrated ability to control costs while maintaining R&D investment, suggesting operational efficiency.

4. Stabilization of Aranesp business: While management expects some further decline, the worst appears to be behind them and the impact is factored into guidance.

While there are some headwinds (expected Aranesp decline, competitive threats), the overwhelmingly positive denosumab data and raised guidance should drive positive sentiment and stock appreciation over the next 1-2 weeks.
