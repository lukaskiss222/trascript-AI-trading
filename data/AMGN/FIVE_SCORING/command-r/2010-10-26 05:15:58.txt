Amgen's Q3 earnings call reveals a mixed bag of results. While EPS declined and expenses increased, revenues remained stable, with promising growth in emerging products.

With several catalytic events upcoming, including the FDA decision on Denosumab and Proliaâ€™s reimbursement improvements, the stock is likely to witness increased volatility in the short term. The overall promising pipeline and solid base business compensate for these teething issues.
