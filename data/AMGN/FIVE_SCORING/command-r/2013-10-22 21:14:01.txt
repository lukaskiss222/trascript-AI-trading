Amgen's earnings call reveals a strong performance in Q3, with a notable increase in product sales. However, the company's pipeline and recent acquisitions, including Onyx Pharmaceuticals, dominate the discussion.

Yet, the recent Onyx acquisition and uncertainty around key contracts, especially Teva's withdrawal of their long-acting filgrastim product, tempered short-term outlook. Despite the stock's resilience, these factors indicate a possible setback in the near future. [-1]
