Amgenâ€™s Q2 results were solid but unremarkable, with management focusing on the recent launch of Prolia and the potential impact of healthcare reform. The modest revenue growth and as-expected guidance, coupled with a strong balance sheet, were drowned out by uncertainties around key drugs like Aranesp and Enbrel. The recent Euro weakness significantly impacts revenue projections. Meanwhile, the Prolia launch, though early, appears promising outside the US, especially in Germany. The stock is likely to consolidate in the short term as uncertainties persist.
