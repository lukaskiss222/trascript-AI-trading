Amgenâ€™s Q1 results showed mixed outcomes, with increased revenues offset by elevated expenses. The main hiervan was the elevated R&D costs, attributed to new launches and pipeline development, and one-time payments related to healthcare reforms and partnerships. While EPS growth remained flat, the strong cash position and reaffirmation of annual guidance were positive indicators. The upcoming Business Review Meeting will provide more clarity on future expenses and capital allocation. The stock is likely to see a slight dip in the short term due to elevated expenses and nuanced commentary around ESAs. However, promising pipeline updates and efficient capital allocation could help cushion any significant negative impact.
