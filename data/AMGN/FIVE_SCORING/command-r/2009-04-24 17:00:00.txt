The mixed first-quarter earnings report and sober revenue guidance highlight the challenges Amgen faces. Macroeconomic issues impacting patient access and demand for drugs, particularly Enbrel, are key concerns. However, cost cutting, a strong balance sheet, and progressing pipeline, particularly denosumab, offer some reassurance. The stock will likely consolidate as investors assess the impact of the challenging environment.
