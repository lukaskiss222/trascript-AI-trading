Amgen's strong Q3 results and raised guidance are positively viewed, especially amidst challenging market conditions. However, the focus for now is on preparations for the November 7th business review, where discussions on commercializing denosumab and other pipeline updates will take place. The executive team's cautious optimism about denosumab's potential in the oncology space is encouraging, but investors should temper their expectations until official results are disclosed. Short-term uncertainty surroundingAranesp's performance and the impending launch of biosimilars in Europe is a minor concern. The stock is likely to experience a moderate positive impact in the short term, but true upside potential lies in the success of denosumab and other pipeline drugs.
