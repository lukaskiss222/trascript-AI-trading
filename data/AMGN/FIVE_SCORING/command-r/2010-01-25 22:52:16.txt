Amgen's Q4 and FY 2009 earnings call reveals a nuanced picture. While EPS grew 8% in 2009, revenue declined 2%. Management's focus on Prolia's impending launch is a positive, but their cautious optimism about 2010 revenue growth is tempered by uncertainties around ESA labels and healthcare reform. A robust pipeline and efficient operations bode well. However, the stock is likely to experience volatility in the short term due to unpredictable factors, including rebating practices, regulatory decisions, and the impact of healthcare reform.
