Amgen's Q4 and FY 2011 earnings call reveals a mixed outlook. While the company demonstrated solid performance in several areas, the future looks challenging due to competition and price erosion, particularly for EPOGEN and ARANESP. However, the management remains optimistic about growth prospects, highlighting successful product launches and focusing on cost management and share repurchases. The upcoming ODAC review for XGEVA and the acquisition of Micromet for its promising cancer treatment add uncertainty. The stock is likely to face pressure in the short term due to these challenges, and structural changes in leadership might take some time to reverberate.
