Amgen's Q4 and FY 2006 earnings transcript reveals a successful year characterized by robust revenue and EPS growth. The outlook for 2007 appears solid, with several key therapies driving growth.

The management's confidence in their pipeline and growth strategies is encouraging, but these uncertainties could influence investors in the coming weeks.
