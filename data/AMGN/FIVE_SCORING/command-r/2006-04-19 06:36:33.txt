Amgen’s Q1 earnings per share grew a notable 26%, but the stock is likely facing short-term pressure due to several factors. The company’s commentary on its products reveals a mixed bag: solid growth in some areas contrast with challenges in the Enbrel segment, attributed to increased competition and reimbursement hurdles. The decision to present three-year data for the denosumab osteoporosis drug candidate pushes approval to 2008. Additionally, the impact of the highly anticipated peg-EPO product from Roche threatens to impact Amgen’s anemia franchise. While management remains optimistic, the short-term prospects appear murky.
