Amgen's Q2 results indicate a stable core business, with solid performance in International markets contributing to overall growth. The key takeaway, however, is the promising denosumab data and the strategic partnership with GSK for its commercialization outside the US. The deal suggests Amgen's confidence in the drug's potential and adds credibility to their long-term growth prospects. With positive clinical outcomes and efficient costs, the stock should see a positive boost in the short term. [1]
