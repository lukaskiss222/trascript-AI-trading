Amgen's positive Q1 results and broad-based portfolio growth are commendable, but the stock's short-term performance is likely to be impacted by mixed sentiments. While solid performances by established products like Neulasta and Enbrel are encouraging, the decline in the ESA franchise is a concern. The potentially game-changing PCSK9 inhibitor and other pipeline progress are positive indicators, but the uncertainty surrounding the EPOGEN franchise and the impact of new competitors in the market is a sizeable disadvantage. Despite these challenges, Amgen'sparser's new leadership and focus on growth through innovation and international expansion could shape a promising future.
