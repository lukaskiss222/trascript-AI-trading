Amgen's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company beating revenue expectations but missing on earnings due to higher operating expenses. The increased expenses were largely driven by investments in new product launches, R&D, and the impact of new legislative costs. Despite this, management expressed confidence in the company's long-term prospects, highlighting strong sales of Enbrel and Filgrastim, as well as promising launches of Prolia and XGEVA. However, the short-term outlook is clouded by uncertainty around ESA labeling, biosimilar competition, and the impact of healthcare reform.
