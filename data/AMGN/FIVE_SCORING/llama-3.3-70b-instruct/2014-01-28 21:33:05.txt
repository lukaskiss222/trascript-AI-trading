Amgen's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with revenues up 13% and earnings per share up 30% year-over-year. The company's guidance for 2014 also looks promising, with expected revenue growth of 3-5% and adjusted EPS growth of 4-7%. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to conservative guidance and potential competition from biosimilars. Overall, the company's pipeline and international expansion efforts are expected to drive long-term growth.
