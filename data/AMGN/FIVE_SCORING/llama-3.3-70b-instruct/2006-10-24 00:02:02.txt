Amgen's Q3 earnings call revealed a strong quarter with 15% revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth, driven by demand for Aranesp and the Filgrastim franchise. The company also announced a strategic acquisition of Avidia and provided updates on its pipeline, including the launch of Vectibix and progress on denosumab studies. However, Enbrel sales were disappointing, and the company faces challenges in defending its intellectual property and competing with new products like Humira. Overall, Amgen's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to its strong earnings and pipeline progress, despite some challenges.
