Amgen's Q1 2006 earnings call revealed solid performance with total revenues growing 14% year-over-year, driven by strong sales of Aranesp and Neulasta. However, the company faces potential headwinds from increased competition, particularly in the Enbrel market, and uncertainties surrounding the ASP reimbursement methodology. Management's confidence in its pipeline, particularly denosumab and panitumumab, and its aggressive stance on patent litigation against Roche's peg-EPO product, are positives. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a short-term neutral impact due to tempered guidance and competitive pressures, but long-term growth prospects remain intact.
