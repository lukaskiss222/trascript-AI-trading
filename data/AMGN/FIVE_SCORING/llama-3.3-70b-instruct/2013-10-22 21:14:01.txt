Amgen's Q3 earnings call revealed a strong performance, with sales up 11% and EPS up 16%. The company raised its guidance for the full year, driven by the contribution from the Onyx acquisition. The management expressed confidence in the long-term growth potential of Kyprolis and the biosimilar business. However, the near-term outlook is somewhat uncertain, given the potential impact of generic competition and the outcome of ongoing clinical trials.
