Amgen's strong Q3 earnings and raised guidance for 2008, combined with a solid pipeline and favorable industry trends, position the company for short-term success. The upcoming commercialization of denosumab and expectations for its potential in the oncology market are also positive catalysts. However, the company faces challenges, including biosimilar competition in Europe and potential pricing pressures. Overall, the company's financial performance, pipeline progress, and management's confidence in its prospects suggest a positive outlook.
