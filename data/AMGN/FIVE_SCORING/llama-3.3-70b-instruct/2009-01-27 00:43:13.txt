Amgen's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record annual sales but facing headwinds from decreased Aranesp sales and increased competition in the rheumatology segment. Management's guidance for 2009 suggests modest revenue growth and a focus on launching Denosumab, which is expected to drive future growth. However, the near-term outlook is uncertain due to potential further declines in Aranesp sales and increased competition. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to these challenges.
