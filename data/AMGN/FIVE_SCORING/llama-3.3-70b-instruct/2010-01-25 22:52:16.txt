Amgen's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with the company achieving record operating cash flow and advancing its pipeline, but also facing challenges such as declining Aranesp sales and uncertainty around healthcare reform. The company's guidance for 2010 projects revenue growth and strong cash generation, but also acknowledges potential headwinds from regulatory and competitive pressures. With the upcoming launch of Prolia, Amgen's new osteoporosis treatment, and a robust pipeline of new products, the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, but may face short-term volatility due to external factors.
