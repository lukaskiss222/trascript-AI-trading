Amgen's earnings call revealed a strong second quarter with a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share, driven by a lower tax rate and decreased share count. The company raised its full-year earnings guidance and announced a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline to commercialize denosumab internationally. While the partnership is expected to create value for both companies, Amgen will retain significant financial flexibility to invest in other programs. The stock is likely to react positively to the raised guidance and partnership news, but may face short-term pressure due to uncertainty around denosumab's launch and ongoing healthcare reform discussions.
