Amgen's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag, with the company achieving record sales but facing challenges in its anemia franchise due to label and reimbursement changes. The guidance for 2007 remains unchanged, but the upcoming NCD announcement in mid-August could impact the company's performance. Management is focused on cost-cutting measures, strategic acquisitions, and pipeline development, which could contribute to long-term growth. However, the short-term outlook is uncertain due to the NCD and other regulatory events.
