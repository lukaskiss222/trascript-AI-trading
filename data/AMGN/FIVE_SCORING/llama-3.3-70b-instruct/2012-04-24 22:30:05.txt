Amgen's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong start to 2012, with record performance in revenues and adjusted earnings per share. The company's product sales growth was driven by broad momentum across its portfolio, including solid gains in Neulasta, Enbrel, and Sensipar, as well as strong growth in Prolia and XGEVA. Management's tone was positive, and they expressed confidence in their ability to deliver growth through innovation and international expansion. With a solid pipeline and a new leadership team in place, Amgen is well-positioned for long-term success. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key products like Enbrel and EPOGEN.
