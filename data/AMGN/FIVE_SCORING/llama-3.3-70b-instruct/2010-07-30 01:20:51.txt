Amgen's Q2 earnings call revealed a solid quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 2% to $3.8 billion. The company's base business performed well, and management expressed confidence in the future, citing resolved uncertainties around Health Care Reform and positive developments in the pipeline, particularly with Prolia and Denosumab. However, tempered guidance due to foreign exchange volatility and increased costs may put short-term pressure on the stock. Overall, the tone was positive, with a focus on execution, growth, and delivering value to shareholders.
