Amgen's Q3 earnings call revealed strong bottom-line results, with EPS exceeding expectations and guidance raised for the year. The company's base business, excluding Aranesp in the US, grew 5%, driven by solid performances from Epogen, Neulasta, and Enbrel. However, the TREAT study results for Aranesp raised concerns about the drug's safety profile, particularly regarding stroke risk and potential cancer implications. Management expressed optimism about Prolia's prospects, despite receiving a complete response letter from the FDA, and plans to continue working closely with regulators to address outstanding issues. Overall, while Amgen faces short-term challenges, its long-term growth drivers, including Prolia and Vectibix, remain promising.
