Amgen's Q1 earnings report showed a 9% increase in revenues and a 20% increase in adjusted EPS, driven by strong sales of its core products and international growth. However, the company's guidance for 2010 was revised to the low end of the range due to the impact of healthcare reform, which is expected to result in a $200-250 million headwind for the year. Despite this, management remains optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, driven by the expected launch of Prolia and the growth of its pipeline products.
