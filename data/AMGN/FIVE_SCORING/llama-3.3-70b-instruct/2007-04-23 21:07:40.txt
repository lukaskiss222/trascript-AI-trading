Amgen's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company achieving strong revenue growth but facing challenges with its anemia franchise due to recent label changes and FDA concerns. While management expressed confidence in the safety and efficacy of its ESA products when used on-label, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key products. The company's efforts to reduce expense growth and invest in its pipeline may help mitigate the impact, but the outlook for 2007 remains uncertain.
