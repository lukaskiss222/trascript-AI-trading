Amgen's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with strong revenue growth driven by Aranesp, ENBREL, and Neulasta, but also concerns around the anemia of cancer study and potential implications for the Aranesp franchise. The company's guidance for 2007 appears conservative, and the market may react negatively to the potential risks associated with Aranesp and the uncertainty surrounding the launch of peg-EPO. However, Amgen's pipeline and diversification efforts remain strong, with several promising products in development, including Vectibix and denosumab.
