Amgen's Q2 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding expectations. The company's non-ESA top-line growth was notable, particularly in Europe, where it competed well against biosimilar competition. The recent denosumab data also exceeded expectations, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in fracture risk in post-menopausal osteoporosis and promising results in other clinical settings. Management expressed enthusiasm for denosumab's potential and confidence in the company's pipeline and long-term growth prospects.
