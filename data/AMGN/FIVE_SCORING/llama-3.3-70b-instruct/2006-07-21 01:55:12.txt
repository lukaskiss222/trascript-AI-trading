Amgen's Q2 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with revenue and adjusted EPS growing 14% and 19%, respectively. The company raised its adjusted EPS guidance by $0.15 to $3.75-$3.85. Key drivers of growth included Aranesp, which achieved its first $1 billion quarter, and Neulasta. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on investing in R&D and expanding product lines. However, the company did face some challenges, including a delay in the initiation of a Phase III study for AMG 706 due to a safety signal. Overall, Amgen's solid performance and confidence in its pipeline suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
