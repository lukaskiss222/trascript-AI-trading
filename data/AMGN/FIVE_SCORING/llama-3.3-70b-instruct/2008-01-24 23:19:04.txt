Amgen's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company achieving record annual sales despite facing significant challenges, particularly in its ESA franchise. The lowered 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts are short-term headwinds. However, management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
