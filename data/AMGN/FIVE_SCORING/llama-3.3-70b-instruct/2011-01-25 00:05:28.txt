Amgen's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company achieving record sales and receiving approvals for key therapies like Prolia and XGEVA, but also facing challenges such as delays in military contracts and reduced body armor forecasts. The management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on advancing the pipeline, investing in research and development, and executing a smart strategy to drive growth. The guidance for 2011 was cautious, with estimated revenues of $15.1-15.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $5-5.20. Considering these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key contracts.
