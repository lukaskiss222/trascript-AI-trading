Amgen's Q1 2008 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with revenue declining 2% year-over-year due to a challenging comparison with the prior year. However, the company's guidance for 2008 remains intact, with projected sales of $19.4 billion to $20.2 billion and EPS of $4.25 to $4.55. The decline in Aranesp sales and the potential impact of label changes on ESA usage are concerns, but management remains confident in the company's ability to deliver on its guidance. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these concerns, but the company's diversified product portfolio and strong pipeline should support long-term growth.
