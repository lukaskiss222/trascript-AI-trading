Amgen reported strong Q4 and full-year sales growth, driven by robust volume increases across all pillars, including the successful integration of Horizon Therapeutics. Management's optimistic guidance for 2024 and confidence in their diversified pipeline further support a positive outlook. Despite some margin pressures from the Horizon acquisition, the overall performance is likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
