Amgen reported flat revenue growth with a 2% increase for the full year and a slight rise in adjusted EPS. While there are concerns regarding declining Aranesp sales and competitive pressures from biosimilars, the company's focus on strategic investments and a robust R&D pipeline, including Denosumab, may provide stability. The balanced guidance aligns with current performance, suggesting a neutral short-term impact on the stock.
