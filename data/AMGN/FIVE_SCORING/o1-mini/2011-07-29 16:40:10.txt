Amgen reported a solid revenue growth of 4% with an 8% increase in product sales, driven by key products like NEUPOGEN, Neulasta, and Enbrel. Despite a slight decline in net income and EPS, the company's optimistic guidance, dividend announcement, and strategic growth initiatives in non-EPOGEN products are likely to bolster investor confidence in the short term.
