Amgen reported steady revenue growth and raised its 2011 guidance, highlighting strong performance in non-ESA products and an aggressive share repurchase program. Despite declines in some ESA products and a one-time reserve charge, the overall management tone is optimistic, reflecting confidence in future growth and shareholder returns. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
