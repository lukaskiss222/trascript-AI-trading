Amgen reported a solid second quarter with strong growth in key products like Prolia, Repatha, and KYPROLIS, and successfully raised its earnings per share guidance. Management maintained an optimistic tone about future growth and ongoing pipeline developments, despite some uncertainties related to Repatha litigation. These factors are likely to drive a positive sentiment in the stock over the next couple of weeks.
