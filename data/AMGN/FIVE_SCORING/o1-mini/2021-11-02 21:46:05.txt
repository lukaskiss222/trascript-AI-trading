Amgen reported solid Q3 results with a 4% revenue increase and an 11% rise in EPS, surpassing expectations. Management's optimistic guidance and strong pipeline developments, despite ongoing COVID-19 challenges, suggest investor confidence should remain intact. The positive financial performance is likely to support a modest short-term uplift in the stock.
