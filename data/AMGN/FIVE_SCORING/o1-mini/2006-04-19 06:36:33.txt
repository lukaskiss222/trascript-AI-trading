Amgen reported strong first-quarter growth with revenues up 14% and adjusted EPS increasing by 26%. The slight raise in earnings guidance and robust performance of key products like Aranesp and Neulasta are positive indicators, despite some challenges with Enbrel. Overall, the results are likely to favorably influence the stock in the near term.
