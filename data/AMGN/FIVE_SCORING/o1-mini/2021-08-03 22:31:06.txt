Amgen reported solid second-quarter growth with revenues up 5% year-over-year and strong performance in key products like Repatha and Otezla. Despite some pricing pressures and ongoing tax disputes, the company's strategic acquisitions and pipeline advancements signal positive momentum. These factors are likely to have a positive short-term impact on Amgen's stock.
