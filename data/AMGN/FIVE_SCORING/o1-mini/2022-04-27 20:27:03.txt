Amgen reported solid first-quarter growth with 6% revenue and 15% EPS increases, driven by strong performance in key products like Repatha and Otezla. Despite challenges such as COVID-19 impacts, currency headwinds, and net selling price declines, the reaffirmation of 2022 guidance and strategic product launches suggest stability. The management's confident tone and focus on long-term growth are likely to maintain investor sentiment without causing significant short-term stock movement.
