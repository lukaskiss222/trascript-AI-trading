Amgen reported solid third-quarter results with a 2% revenue increase and an 11% rise in non-GAAP earnings per share, alongside an upward revision of its 2016 guidance. Management's focus on innovative product launches and international expansion, despite some competitive pressures, suggests confidence in sustained growth.
