Amgen reported a slight revenue decline of 1%, but offset this with a strong 15% increase in non-GAAP EPS and raised its full-year guidance, reflecting confidence in its growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. Management's positive tone and robust product performance are likely to reassure investors despite the marginal top-line dip. The overall sentiment suggests a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
