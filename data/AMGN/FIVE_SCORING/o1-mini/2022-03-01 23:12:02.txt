ChemoCentryx reported a significant increase in net loss and a decrease in collaboration revenues compared to the previous year, which may concern investors in the short term. However, the successful launch of TAVNEOS and positive early adoption metrics could offset some negative sentiment by signaling future growth potential. The mixed financial results are likely to lead to a cautious reaction in the stock.
