Amgen's earnings call for the first quarter of 2010 indicates a solid start to the year with a 9% increase in revenue and a 20% rise in adjusted EPS. The company's management expressed optimism about the impact of healthcare reform and maintained their guidance for 2010, although revenue and EPS expectations are at the lower end due to the anticipated financial impacts of healthcare legislation. The upcoming launch of Prolia in the US and Europe is highlighted as a potential growth driver. However, concerns about increased operating expenses and the financial impact of healthcare reforms may exert some short-term downward pressure on the stock.
