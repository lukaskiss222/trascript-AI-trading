Amgen's Q1 2018 earnings call presented mixed implications for its short-term stock price. The company reported a solid start to 2018 with growth in product sales, especially from newer treatments like Repatha and Aimovig, bolstered by anticipated launches and positive R&D developments. However, the market faces ongoing challenges with established products encountering competition and potential generic threats. While management expressed confidence in the overall growth trajectory, immediate investor sentiment might be neutral, balancing current successes against longer-term strategic investments and competitive pressures.
