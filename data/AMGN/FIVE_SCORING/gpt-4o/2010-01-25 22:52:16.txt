Amgen's earnings call revealed cautious optimism for 2010 despite a challenging 2009. While revenues in 2009 slightly declined due to label changes and competition, the company anticipates a return to growth driven by upcoming product launches like Prolia. Discussions with the FDA are progressing, and regulatory approvals are expected. Amgen's strong balance sheet and share repurchase program signal confidence, but uncertainties remain surrounding healthcare reform's impact. The positive outlook for pipeline progression and stable cost structures indicate a potential short-term positive impact on the stock as the market digests the expected product launches and regulatory filings.
