Amgen's Q1 2006 earnings call showed strong financial performance, with revenue and EPS growth surpassing expectations, driven by robust product sales, particularly for Aranesp and Neulasta. The company also updated guidance positively, even accounting for the Abgenix acquisition. Key strategic moves like the expansion of clinical trials and the aggressive defense of patents against competitor Roche further contribute to a positive outlook. Despite competitive pressures and some challenges with Enbrel, the overall tone and results should create a positive short-term impact on the stock.
