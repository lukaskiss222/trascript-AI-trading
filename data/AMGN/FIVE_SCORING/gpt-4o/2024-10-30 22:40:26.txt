Amgen's third-quarter performance showcased strong growth, with revenues up 23% and a robust pipeline advancement. The focus on MariTide, expected to significantly impact obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment, highlights positive sentiment, alongside strong sales growth in oncology and rare diseases. However, the management has provided cautious guidance, with Q4 EPS expected to decrease due to increased investments.
