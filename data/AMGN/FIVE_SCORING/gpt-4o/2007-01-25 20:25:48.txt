Amgen's earnings transcript reveals robust performance in 2006 with strong revenue (15% growth) and EPS growth (22%). The launch of Vectibix and impressive pipeline initiatives, including several key phases in clinical trials, highlight potential growth avenues. However, concern around anemia-related studies, particularly Aranesp's mortality data in a non-label use case, may cause investor unease despite the company's reassurances. The 2007 guidance suggests conservative revenue growth between 8% to 12%, which might seem conservative compared to Q4's performance, raising questions about anticipated headwinds like competition or market conditions.
