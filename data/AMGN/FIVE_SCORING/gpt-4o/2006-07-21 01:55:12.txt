Amgen reported strong financial performance with a 14% revenue increase and a 19% rise in adjusted EPS for the quarter, leading to raised EPS guidance. The company's demand-driven growth, especially for Aranesp and international sales, coupled with cost efficiencies and reduced royalty expenses, indicates robust operational execution. However, the announcement of a delay in launching AMG 706 due to unexpected side effects could concern investors. Overall, the positive financial results and improved guidance are likely to bolster short-term stock performance, with a minor caution due to the drug development delay.
