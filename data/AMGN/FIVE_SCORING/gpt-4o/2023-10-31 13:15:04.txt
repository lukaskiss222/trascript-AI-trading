Amgen's Q3 2023 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance with revenue growth of 4% and double-digit volume increases across multiple products. The recent Horizon acquisition and positive developments in promising drug pipelines, such as Repatha and EVENITY, showcase strategic growth potential. Management's confident tone and increased guidance for full-year revenue suggest short-term stock price strength. The positive product performance and integration synergies from Horizon can likely bolster investor sentiment, supporting a stock uptick in the coming weeks.
