Amgen's earnings call for Q1 2011 displayed a mix of stable growth and strategic investments. Revenue growth of 3%, driven by strong sales of Enbrel and XGEVA, is positively noted. However, the significant 13% increase in operating expenses due to investments in new product launches and R&D may weigh on short-term profitability, despite a lower tax rate benefiting net income. Overall, while the company shows promising long-term potential with product innovations and international expansion, these increased expenses and market challenges in specific segments could result in short-term stock pressure.
