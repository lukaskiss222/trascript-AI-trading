The Amgen Q2 2007 earnings call highlighted several significant challenges, particularly concerning the anemia franchise. Despite achieving EPS growth and aligning costs with revenue expectations, the company is grappling with regulatory uncertainties, notably the upcoming CMS national coverage decision and CRDAC meetings that could impact revenue. Managementâ€™s cautious tone, coupled with the indication of slight revenue downturns and the ESA franchise under pressure, creates a negative short-term sentiment. The stock may experience downward pressure due to these concerns about regulatory outcomes and declining sales in key products.
