Amgen's Q2 2010 earnings call presents a mixed picture. The company recorded only a modest 2% revenue growth and struggles with declining sales in major products like Aranesp, though this was offset slightly by new product launches such as Prolia. Although international expansion is a priority, European economic uncertainties and healthcare reforms pose short-term challenges. Nonetheless, accelerated regulatory approvals and product launches in oncology and Prolia suggest potential upside, though reimbursement hurdles remain. The reiteration of EPS guidance indicates stable expectations, but short-term market reactions will likely focus on the sales struggles and regulatory impacts.
