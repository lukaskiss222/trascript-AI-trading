Amgen's Q3 2008 earnings call conveyed a solid performance with a 7% increase in revenues, bolstered by international sales growth and robust earnings. The raised guidance for both revenue and earnings per share for 2008, coupled with the potential of denosumab, suggests continued investor optimism. However, uncertainties around Aranesp due to label changes and new competition, as well as potential broader economic impacts, could hamper momentum. Overall, the strong results and optimistic outlook imply a likely positive short-term impact on the stock.
