Amgen Inc.'s earnings call reveals a positive launch of TAVNEOS, with initial uptake by physicians, particularly rheumatologists, and a promising conversion rate of patient start forms to patients on the drug. The approval and launch in multiple regions, including the U.S. and EU, along with ongoing efforts to expand the drug's indications, signal a strong growth outlook. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's efforts in market education and patient support appear to be effective. These factors are likely to positively impact the stock in the short term.
