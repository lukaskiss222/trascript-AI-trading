### Analysis:
The earnings call for Amgen Inc. revealed several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term. The company reported strong financial performance in 2022, with significant growth in several of its key products, including Repatha, Prolia, and EVENITY. Additionally, the company's pipeline includes several promising assets, such as Olpasiran and AMG 133, which have shown positive results in clinical trials. The company's biosimilars business also continues to grow, with positive data for several candidates, including AMGEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong financial performance and promising pipeline. However, investors should closely monitor the company's progress in its biosimilar launches and the potential impact of competition in the market. Additionally, the company's tax rate increase due to changes in Puerto Rico's tax laws may have a slight negative impact on earnings, but this is expected to be offset by volume growth and cost savings. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term, with potential for further growth as the company continues to execute on its strategic initiatives.
