### Analysis

Amgen's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with strong growth in key product categories like Enbrel, Filgrastim, and XGEVA, but also a decline in EPOGEN sales and uncertainty surrounding the proposed QIP changes. The company's management was optimistic about the future, but the short-term implications for the stock price are uncertain due to the ongoing uncertainty around the EPOGEN business and potential regulatory changes. The stock is likely to experience volatility in the near term as investors digest the earnings and guidance.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be **neutral** due to the mixed signals from the earnings call. While there are positive developments in key product categories, the uncertainty around the EPOGEN business and potential regulatory changes may cause some volatility. The company's guidance for 2011 was adjusted upward, suggesting a positive outlook, but the uncertainty around the EPOGEN business may temper this optimism.
