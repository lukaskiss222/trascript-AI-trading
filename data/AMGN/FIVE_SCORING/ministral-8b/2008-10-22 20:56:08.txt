**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. revealed a strong performance in Q3 2008, with revenue growth of 7%, driven by robust sales in the U.S. and international markets. The company also reported a 14% increase in adjusted EPS, driven by lower operating expenses and strong sales momentum. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with a cash balance of $9.8 billion and sufficient liquidity to repay debt. The company also raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, reflecting the sales momentum and lower operating expenses. The company's R&D expenses were relatively unchanged year-over-year, reflecting the completion of large phase 3 trials for denosumab and the need to rein in additional expense. The company also announced that it will not issue specific long-term financial guidance on November 7, but will provide perspective on its plans and expectations. The company's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative, given the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. The company's strong performance in Q3 2008 and the raised guidance may provide some support to the stock price, but the overall outlook remains uncertain.
