**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. revealed strong Q1 performance, with revenues up 9% and adjusted EPS up 20%. The company's focus on innovation and strategic partnerships, such as the deal with AstraZeneca and the acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals, is likely to drive growth. However, the company faces challenges in the EPOGEN franchise and potential competition in the oncology market. The transition of leadership from Kevin Sharer to Bob Bradway is expected to be smooth, and the new CEO's focus on growth and innovation is likely to be well-received by investors.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on Amgen's stock price is expected to be positive, driven by the strong Q1 results and the company's continued focus on innovation and growth. The stock is likely to see a rally in the next 1-2 weeks.
