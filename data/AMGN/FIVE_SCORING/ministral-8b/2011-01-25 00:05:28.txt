### Analysis:

Amgen's Q4 and FY 2010 results show a mixed performance with financials being relatively stable despite challenges from healthcare reform and regulatory uncertainties. The approvals of Prolia and XGEVA were highlighted as significant achievements, but the company faces ongoing challenges such as the ESA REMS and potential regulatory changes. The guidance for 2011 projects revenue growth and EPS, but there are uncertainties around the impact of healthcare reform and the potential for further dose declines in EPOGEN. The acquisition of BioVex adds to the pipeline and strategic growth, but it also involves costs and risks.

### Conclusion:

The earnings call indicates a mixed outlook for Amgen's stock. While the approvals of Prolia and XGEVA are positive, the uncertainties around healthcare reform and EPOGEN dose declines could lead to short-term volatility. The acquisition of BioVex is a strategic move but comes with associated costs and risks. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the mixed outlook and uncertainties.
