### Analysis:

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. in the third quarter of 2017 revealed a mixed picture. The company reported flat year-over-year revenue excluding foreign exchange impacts and a 5% increase in operating income. Key drivers of growth included strong performances in Repatha and KYPROLIS, while Enbrel and Neulasta saw declines. The company also highlighted the impact of Hurricane Maria on its Puerto Rican operations, with $67 million in pre-tax expenses related to inventory, idle facilities, repairs, and support for staff. Management expressed optimism about the company's strategic position and the potential for growth in 2018, particularly with the launch of Aimovig for migraine and the expansion of its biosimilar portfolio. However, the call also raised concerns about the impact of Hurricane Maria and the potential for further disruptions in Puerto Rico.

### Conclusion:

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Amgen's stock is likely to be positive, given the company's strong performance in key areas and the optimism expressed by management about future growth prospects. However, investors should be mindful of the potential risks associated with Hurricane Maria and the ongoing litigation surrounding biosimilar products. The stock is expected to experience a positive impact, but the magnitude of the impact may vary depending on the resolution of these issues.
