Based on the earnings transcript, Amgen's Q1 results show a 3% revenue growth, with strong performance from Prolia and Enbrel, but increased operating expenses due to new product launches and regulatory costs. R&D expenses increased by 14%, and the adjusted tax rate decreased due to the Puerto Rico excise tax credit. The company reaffirmed its 2011 guidance, expecting sales between $14.1 billion and $14.7 billion and adjusted EPS between $5.19 and $5.38. The stock is likely to see short-term positive impact due to the strong Q1 performance and the company's commitment to cost control and strategic investments.
