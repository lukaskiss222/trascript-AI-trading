### Analysis:
Amgen's Q4 and full-year results were strong, with notable growth in sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% for most products. The company's pipeline advancements, including sotorasib and tezepelumab, received significant attention. Management highlighted the company's focus on digital capabilities, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in China and Germany. The company also provided guidance for 2021, projecting sales of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion and EPS of $16 to $17 per share. Despite some delays in military contracts and reduced body armor forecasts, the company's focus on non-defense market growth and cost-saving measures suggests long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
