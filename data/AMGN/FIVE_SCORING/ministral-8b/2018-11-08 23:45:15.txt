**Analysis:**

The earnings call for ChemoCentryx provided a mix of positive and neutral signals for the stock. The company highlighted strong clinical progress with avacopan, its lead asset, and the potential for multiple indications. The ADVOCATE Phase III trial for ANCA vasculitis is expected to provide top-line data in Q4 2019, followed by data from the C3G and HS trials. Additionally, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CCX140 in FSGS, suggesting potential for another indication. However, the company reported a net loss for the third quarter and guidance for the fourth quarter was not provided. The stock is likely to face short-term volatility due to the anticipation of clinical data and potential regulatory decisions. The overall tone of the call was positive, but the lack of clear revenue growth and the significant clinical focus may lead to uncertainty in the near term.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, with potential for volatility as investors await clinical data and regulatory decisions.

**Rating:**
