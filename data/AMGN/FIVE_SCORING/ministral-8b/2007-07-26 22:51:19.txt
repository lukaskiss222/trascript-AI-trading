The earnings call for Amgen Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results and plans. The company managed to achieve EPS growth of 7% and is on track to meet the lower end of its original 2007 EPS guidance, but the growth is below historical performance levels. The company is facing several challenges, including reduced sales for its anemia franchise and uncertainty around key events such as the National Coverage Decision (NCD) and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee (CRAC) meeting. Management expressed optimism about the company's pipeline and the potential for long-term growth, but the short-term outlook remains uncertain.

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
