### Analysis

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. provided a mixed bag of news, with both positive and negative elements that could impact the stock price in the short term.

#### Positive Elements:
1. **Revenue Growth**: Amgen reported a 15% increase in revenue and a 22% increase in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter. These numbers exceeded expectations.
2. **Product Launches**: The launch of Vectibix was a notable success, with strong initial market acceptance and promising data.
3. **Strategic Acquisitions**: The acquisition of Avidia and the partnership with Fresenius were highlighted as strategic moves to expand therapeutic capabilities and market share.
4. **R&D Investment**: Amgen continues to invest heavily in R&D, with nine mega-trials initiated in 2006 and plans for more in 2007.

#### Negative Elements:
1. **Enbrel Performance**: Enbrel is not meeting expectations, with growth rates slowing and new competitors entering the market.
2. **EPOGEN Sales**: EPOGEN sales are growing at a slower rate than expected, and there are concerns about the potential impact of new long-acting EPO products.
3. **Legal Concerns**: The company is facing potential legal challenges regarding bundling contracts and patent infringements.
4. **Uncertainty in R&D**: The FDA's requests for additional data on Aranesp and the potential for CMS to change reimbursement rules for cancer drugs add uncertainty.

### Conclusion

The mixed signals from the earnings call suggest a short-term neutral impact on the stock price. While the revenue and EPS growth are positive, the challenges with Enbrel and the uncertainty around legal and regulatory issues could dampen investor sentiment in the short term. Additionally, the company's continued investment in R&D and strategic acquisitions indicate long-term growth potential but may not immediately translate into stock price appreciation.
