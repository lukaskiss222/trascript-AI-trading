### Short-Term (1-2 Weeks) Implications

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. revealed several key points that will likely impact the stock price in the short term:

1. **Quarterly Revenue Decline**: Amgen reported a 1% decline in revenue, driven primarily by a 3% decrease in US sales and an increase in international sales. The company attributed the decline to a tough year-over-year comparison and the impact of biosimilar competition.

2. **Cost of Sales and R&D**: The cost of sales decreased by 3% due to lower sales volumes, while R&D expenses declined by 18% year-over-year. The company emphasized that this decline was due to lower staff-related costs and other expense reductions from restructuring, rather than a change in R&D strategy.

3. **SG&A Expenses**: SG&A expenses increased due to higher Wyeth profit share expenses, which accounted for three-quarters of the increase. Despite this, the company expects SG&A expenses to be similar to 2007 levels at the full year, excluding the Wyeth payment.

4. **Product Performance**: Aranesp sales declined 25% worldwide, with a 38% decrease in the US. ENBREL experienced 30% growth, driven by a one-time impact from distribution model changes and continued solid demand. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 7% due to demand and inventory reductions.

5. **FDA Label Changes and ESA Franchise**: The company highlighted ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding ESA label changes and the potential impact on Aranesp sales. The company is optimistic about the FDA's approval of Nplate later this year.

6. **Upcoming Events**: The company postponed its business review due to the lack of key data, and it expects to have more to say about the ESA franchise, denosumab, and its long-term outlook as soon as the necessary data is available.

### Conclusion

Given the mixed signals from the earnings call, the short-term impact on Amgenâ€™s stock price is likely to be **neutral** or **slightly negative**. The revenue decline, cost-saving measures, and uncertainty around ESA label changes and biosimilar competition may weigh on the stock. However, the company's commitment to R&D spending and its pipeline of new products may provide some support. Overall, investors should expect a cautious response from the stock market in the near term.
