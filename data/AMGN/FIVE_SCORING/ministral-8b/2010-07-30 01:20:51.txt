However, the company's guidance for 2010 revenue and EPS remains unchanged, indicating a cautious approach to the current market conditions.

**Short-Term Impact on Stock Price**: Amgen's stock price is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The company's solid financial performance and strategic direction suggest that the stock is well-positioned for growth, but the lack of significant changes in guidance may limit upside potential. Additionally, the company's exposure to Health Care Reform and the potential impact of the final rule on dialysis bundling could introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the stock price is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term.
