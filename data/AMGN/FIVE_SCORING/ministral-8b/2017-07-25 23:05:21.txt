### Analysis:

The earnings call for Amgen Inc. in the second quarter of 2017 highlighted strong financial performance, with revenue and earnings growth driven by newer products and effective lifecycle management of legacy products. The company's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. The company's focus on long-term growth and strategic expansions may not be immediately reflected in the stock price.
