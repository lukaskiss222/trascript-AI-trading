Amgen's Q2 2006 earnings call revealed strong financial performance with revenue and adjusted EPS growing 14% and 19%, respectively. The company highlighted significant achievements in its pipeline, including the initiation of seven mega-trials, and the expected launch of Vectibix by year-end. Management also addressed the ongoing Roche litigation and expressed confidence in the company's position. Key concerns include the potential impact of biosimilars in Europe and the need to manage the competitive landscape. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty around Roche's peg-EPO and the need to manage the competitive landscape in the biosimilar market.

### Conclusion:
Given the strong financial performance and pipeline progress, while also acknowledging potential challenges, the stock is likely to experience a **positive impact** in the short term.

**Rating:** 1
