**Analysis:**

The earnings call for ChemoCentryx highlighted strong progress in their clinical pipeline, particularly in the CCR2 and C5a receptor inhibitor programs. The company reported positive Phase II results for CCX140 in diabetic nephropathy and plans to advance CCX872 into pancreatic cancer. The C5a receptor inhibitor program also made progress with the CLEAR trial in ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, the company's financial results were weak, with no revenue recognized in the fourth quarter. The financial guidance for 2015 was also modest, with a projected cash utilization of $45 million to $49 million. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lack of revenue and modest guidance, but the strong clinical pipeline may provide long-term support.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the lack of revenue and modest guidance. However, the strong clinical pipeline may provide long-term support for the stock.

**Rating:**
