Based on the transcript, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) implications for ChemoCentryx are mixed, but generally positive. The company reported strong financial performance, with record sales and net income, and provided encouraging updates on its clinical trials, particularly for avacopan in ANCA vasculitis and HS. The delay in the AURORA trial due to COVID-19 is a concern, but the company remains optimistic about the trial's results. The company's financial strength, with over $500 million in cash and cash equivalents, provides a solid foundation for future growth. Overall, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the company's progress and strong financial position.
