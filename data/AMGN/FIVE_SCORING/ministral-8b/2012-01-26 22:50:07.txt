**Analysis:**

Amgen’s Q4 and full-year results call revealed strong performance in 2011 with record sales and steady growth across key products. The company's strategic acquisitions, including Micromet, position it well for future growth. However, the call also highlighted challenges such as the potential impact of EPOGEN label changes and the need for regulatory approvals for new indications. Management's optimism about the company's outlook and the potential of new products like XGEVA and Prolia suggests a positive trajectory for the stock in the short term.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1–2 weeks) impact on Amgen's stock is likely to be **positive** due to the strong financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and optimistic outlook for future growth. The stock is expected to benefit from the company's continued momentum and the potential for new product launches.
