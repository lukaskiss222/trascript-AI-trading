Based on the provided transcript, the short-term implications for Amgen Inc. are mixed. The company reported strong Q1 results with revenue up 15% and adjusted EPS growing 19%, driven by demand for Aranesp, ENBREL, and Neulasta. However, the outlook for 2007 is uncertain due to potential changes in reimbursement and the FDA's review of Aranesp's safety profile. The company expects EPS to be at the low end of its previously stated range of $4.30 to $4.50, and it is taking actions to reduce the growth of its operating expenses to offset potential revenue impact. The company also mentioned that it is reviewing its manufacturing facility construction timeline in Ireland and expects its capital expenditures in 2007 to be in line with 2006. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the uncertainty surrounding Aranesp's safety profile and the potential impact of reimbursement changes on its revenue. However, the company's strong pipeline and ongoing clinical trials suggest long-term growth potential.
