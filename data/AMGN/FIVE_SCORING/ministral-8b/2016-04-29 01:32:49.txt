**Analysis:**
Amgen's Q1 2016 earnings report showed strong performance, with 10% revenue growth and 17% adjusted earnings per share growth. The companyâ€™s pipeline is robust, and new product launches are expected to drive long-term growth. However, there are concerns around competition and reimbursement, especially for REPATHA. The stock may face short-term pressure due to these challenges, but the company's strong balance sheet and pipeline suggest long-term potential.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's strong balance sheet and pipeline suggest long-term potential.

**Rating:**
