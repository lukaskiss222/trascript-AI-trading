Amgen's Q1 2007 earnings call highlighted a mixed bag of results with strong overall revenue growth and EPS, tempered by concerns over the ESA (Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) product label changes and uncertainties in key product markets. While international sales and other products like ENBREL performed well, issues with Aranesp and EPOGEN could exert downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. Investors might remain cautious pending more clarity on ESA usage guidelines and reimbursement changes.
