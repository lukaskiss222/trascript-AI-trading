Amgenâ€™s earnings call reflects a company with a solid performance in 2011 and a positive outlook for 2012. The Neulasta franchise, Enbrel market leadership, and the strong growth of growth-phase products like Sensipar, Vectibix, and Nplate are likely to drive earnings. However, there are concerns regarding potential declines in Aranesp sales due to biosimilar competition in Europe and some uncertainties around the full impact of EPOGEN's label changes on dialysis demographics. Management's proactive guidance and strategic initiatives suggest continued growth, particularly with the acquisition of Micromet and plans for international expansion. That said, initial softness in revenue due to changes in EPOGEN dosing and competition could temper excitement in the immediate term, but overall, the updates from Amgen should see a positive investor response in the short term due to the promise of new products and potential market expansion.
