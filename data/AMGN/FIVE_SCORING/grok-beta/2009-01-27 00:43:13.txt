The 2008 Q4 earnings call for Amgen Inc. presented a mixed outlook for short-term stock movement. Although Amgen managed operational challenges well, their revenue and earnings guidance for 2009 was bleak due to the anticipated impact of Aranesp label changes, competitive pressures, and a cautious economic environment. Furthermore, the strategic focus on cost-cutting measures while heavily investing in commercialization of Denosumab could limit short-term earnings growth. The flat revenue projection, the company's focus on share repurchases rather than growth initiatives, and potential FDA risks with Denosumab could create pressure on the stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
