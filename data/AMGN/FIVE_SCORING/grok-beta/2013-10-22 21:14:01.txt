Amgen's third quarter showed a positive trend with an 11% sales increase and improved earnings per share, suggesting that the stock might experience a short-term lift due to this performance and positive guidance updates. However, mixed outlooks on specific products, geopolitical considerations like the China expansion, and the integration of Onyx pose some uncertainty. Overall, the stock is likely to see a modest positive impact in the short term.
