Amgenâ€™s Q3 results showed strong revenue and EPS growth, with particular strength in Enbrel sales. Uncertainty persists due to upcoming generic competition for Zometa, potential impacts from tax law changes, and competition in the ESA market. However, the company's robust pipeline updates, disciplined operational efficiency, and successful commercial strategies mitigate some risk. Given these mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience a neutral short-term impact.
