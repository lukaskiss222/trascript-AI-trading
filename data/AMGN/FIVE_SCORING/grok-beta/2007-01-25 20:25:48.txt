The earnings call for Amgen Inc. signals a strong finish to 2006 with robust revenue and EPS growth, driven by demand for key products like Aranesp, ENBREL, and Neulasta. However, potential headwinds from clinical data issues in the Anemia of Cancer (AOC) study and ongoing patent litigation could introduce some uncertainty in the short term. Despite these concerns, the company's strategic focus on late-stage trials and new molecule introductions, coupled with a strong pipeline, suggests a positive impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks as investors focus on future potential over current controversies.
