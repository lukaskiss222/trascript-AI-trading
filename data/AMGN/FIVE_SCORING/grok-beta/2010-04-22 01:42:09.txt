Amgen's Q1 earnings represent a strong start, with revenue and EPS growth, albeit tempered by anticipated health care reform costs. Management's optimism about Prolia and other pipeline developments suggests a commitment to growth, but the lowered guidance, increased operating expenses, and potential future uncertainties from healthcare reform may introduce caution among investors in the short term. The overall tone suggests resilience in the long term but indicates potential short-term price pressure as expectations are adjusted.
