Amgen's Q1 performance showed robust growth in products like Enbrel and Filgrastim. However, the operating expense increase of 13% signals significant investments, which could raise concerns about short-term margin pressure. While the launches of XGEVA and Prolia are promising, the overall earnings per share only grew by 3%, suggesting a tepid reaction from investors. Given the already high expectations and potential concerns over cost increases, the stock might see a neutral short-term impact as investors await further details on cost management and long-term growth strategies in the upcoming business review meeting.
