Amgen's Q1 2008 earnings call reflects a mix of challenges and reassurances. Key factors include the decline in Aranesp sales which may continue, partly offset by growth from other products like ENBREL. Operational efficiencies are expected to balance expenses, and there's confidence in hitting EPS guidance. The ongoing ESA label discussions and potential impact on Aranesp usage, along with the inherent challenges in forecasting pharmaceutical outcomes, suggest a range of potential impacts on stock price in the short term. The company's pipeline and strategic focus offer long-term potential but short-term predictability remains complex.
