The Q1 2006 earnings call highlighted Amgen's strong financial performance with a 26% increase in adjusted EPS and 14% increase in revenue, bolstering expectations for continued growth.

The announced 30%â€“40% R&D expense increase reflects optimism in pipeline development. These developments suggest likely near-term stock price volatility due to patent litigation, while solid short-term growth fundamentals might cushion the impact.
