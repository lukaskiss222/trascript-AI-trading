Amgen's Q3 2010 earnings call highlighted several points that suggest a mixed impact on the stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks. Positively, the launch of Prolia for osteoporosis is progressing with favorable clinical feedback and the reminder of full reimbursement in key European markets. However, ongoing challenges with Prolia access include reimbursement dynamics, the need for Part D coverage in early 2011, and conservative adoption by primary care physicians. Additionally, concerns around EPOGEN sales, bundled impact, and ESA REMS program influence act as short-term hurdles. The reaffirmation of revenue guidance provides some stabilizing confidence.
