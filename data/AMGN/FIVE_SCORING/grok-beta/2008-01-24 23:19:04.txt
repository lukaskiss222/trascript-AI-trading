Amgen's 2007 Q4 and full-year results reveal a complex outlook for the short-term. While the company showcased resilience by outperforming its EPS guidance despite ESA challenges, several red flags were raised: potential declines in ESA sales due to reimbursement policies, new competition for ENBREL, and uncertainty around Vectibix growth prospects. However, the very positive outcomes of the Denosumab trial and R&D progress signal potential for future growth. The stock might face some immediate bearish pressure due to the full-year impact of ESA changes, but underlying positive R&D momentum, international sales growth, and strategic cost-cutting could provide some support.
