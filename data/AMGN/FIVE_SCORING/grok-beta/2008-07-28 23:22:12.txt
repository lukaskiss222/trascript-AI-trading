Amgen's Q2 2008 earnings call provided crucial updates, especially regarding the denosumab program, which showed significant promise for osteoporosis treatment. Despite a setback with Aranesp labeling, the strong performance in non-ESA products, particularly in biosimilars markets in Europe, underpins a positive outlook. The raised guidance suggests confidence in sustained growth, however, the potential challenges with Aranesp in the oncology market could exert short-term pressure. Overall, the positive developments, especially around denosumab, are likely to outweigh immediate concerns, suggesting a mildly positive impact on the stock.
