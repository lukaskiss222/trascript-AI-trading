Amgen's Q3 2006 earnings showed a strong performance with a 15% increase in revenue, strong EPS growth, and exceeded expectations. While the company managed to raise EPS guidance and invest heavily in R&D, potential short-term headwinds include ongoing legal issues with Roche's peg-EPO and uncertainties regarding the clinical and regulatory acceptance of their pipeline. However, the stock is likely to benefit from the positive Enbrel guidance, strategic acquisitions, and the launch of Vectibix.
