Amgen's Q1 earnings call highlighted significant challenges with lower-than-expected demand due to economic factors, inventory adjustments at wholesalers, and unfavorable product mix. The company's management responded decisively with cost actions to affirm EPS guidance, showcasing resilience. However, the emphasis on promoting new product initiatives like denosumab amidst ongoing economic uncertainty suggests that growth potential in the short term might be limited, likely resulting in a slight negative impact on the stock price as investors might be concerned about near-term revenue deceleration.
