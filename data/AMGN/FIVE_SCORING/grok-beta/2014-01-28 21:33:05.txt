Amgen's earnings call shows strong Q4 and full-year growth in revenues, earnings, and several key products, indicating ongoing robust performance into 2014. However, the guidance for next year suggests a potential softening in revenue growth rates, likely due to increased competition, pricing pressures in Europe, and uncertainties around key launches like Evolocumab. Nonetheless, the company's strategic actions, such as the acquisition of Onyx, and the promising outlook for these new therapies could temper negative expectations. Given these factors, while there might be some initial stock pressure, the long-term potential remains positive, suggesting a neutral short-term impact.
