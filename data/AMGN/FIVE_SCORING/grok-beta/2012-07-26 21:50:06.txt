Amgen's Q2 2012 earnings showed strong revenue and EPS growth, with particular emphasis on Enbrel and the successful global launch of XGEVA and Prolia. However, expectations around new competition from oral inhibitors like those targeted by JAK inhibitors may put some downward pressure on stock performance in the short term. Nonetheless, raised guidance for the year and promising pipeline developments provide some optimism for the stock's long-term trajectory. On balance, the current momentum in established products, strategic acquisitions, and pipeline advancements could lead to a slight rebound after initial reactions.
