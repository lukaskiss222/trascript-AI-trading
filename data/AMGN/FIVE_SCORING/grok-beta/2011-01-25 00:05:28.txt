Amgen's Q4 and full-year earnings call indicates a cautious outlook for short-term stock movement. The mixed results include solid performance and new product approvals but are tempered by concerns over healthcare reform impacts, an increase in R&D spending, and potential regulatory changes affecting key products like EPOGEN. These factors, along with the modest guidance for 2011, suggest that investors might react with a slight negative bias in the short term until more clarity emerges on these issues.
