Amgen displayed a quarter with strong financial performance, including record revenues and adjusted EPS, with growth driven by key products like Neulasta and Enbrel. The transition to new CEO Bob Bradway went smoothly, and the company's strategic moves in R&D and acquisitions suggest continued innovation. However, slight concerns persist about the sustainability of some product sales momentum and the ongoing impact of ESA declines, despite a positive outlook for new and established products like XGEVA and Prolia. Given these factors and ongoing stock repurchase plans, combined with positive R&D news, I expect a short-term neutral to positive impact on Amgen's stock price.
