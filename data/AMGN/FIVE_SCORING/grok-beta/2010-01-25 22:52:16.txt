Amgen's Q4 results and 2010 outlook present several positive factors, including a return to top-line growth, strong cash flow generation, and the imminent launch of Prolia globally. However, uncertainties around healthcare reform, ongoing ESA-related events, and the mixed performance of some key products introduce potential risks. While the company's ambitious goal for top quartile industry performance signals confidence, near-term stock performance might be tempered until the results of key regulatory and clinical milestones clarify investor sentiment.
