Amgenâ€™s Q2 2009 earnings report highlights several positive developments, including a raise in full-year earnings guidance and a strategic partnership with GlaxoSmithKline for denosumab. These moves suggest a solid business performance and potential for increased market share. However, the complexity of healthcare reform, uncertainties around denosumab's FDA review, and the impact of foreign exchange rates pose risks. Overall, the news of raised guidance and a strategic partnership for commercialization could provide short-term confidence, likely resulting in a slight positive reaction by investors.
