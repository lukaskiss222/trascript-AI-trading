**Analysis:**

Amgen Inc. disclosed a mixed performance in their earnings call, with a slight revenue growth, successful product launches like Prolia, and a robust pipeline for future growth. However, several factors suggest a cautious outlook for the stock in the short term:

1. **Revenue Guidance Reduction**: A slight reduction in revenue guidance was orchestrated due to a weaker euro, signaling potential challenges in meeting expectations despite growth in other areas.

2. **Regulatory and Market Uncertainty**: Upcoming regulatory decisions, like the bundling payment system for dialysis patients and the impact of Health Care Reform, introduce short-term uncertainties that could affect stock movement.

3. **Product Specific Challenges**: While the company highlighted some positive product trends, the decline in ARANESP sales suggests a competitive pressure or strategic shift within the ESA franchise. 

4. **Increased Operating Expenses**: Both R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the second half of the year, which might pressure profitability if not offset by revenue increase.

**Conclusion:**

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Amgen's stock seems mixed with some positive developments overshadowed by immediate concerns:

- Global expansion efforts signal long-term growth but might not immediately reflect in stock price.
- The company's pipeline and recent product approvals suggest future revenue growth, yet the immediate market reactions might be tempered by current financial guidance adjustments and regulatory uncertainties.
