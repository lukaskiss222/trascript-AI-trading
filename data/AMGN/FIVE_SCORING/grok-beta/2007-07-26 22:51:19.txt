Amgen's second quarter call highlighted several areas of concern, primarily within the anemia franchise with sales declining due to new label changes and reimbursement issues, leading to lower demand and conservative physician behavior. Despite these challenges, the company is making strategic moves with acquisitions like Alantos and Ilypsa, and positive outcomes in the denosumab trials, which could lead to long-term growth but aren't immediate performance drivers. The cautious outlook following the anemia franchise issues, coupled with uncertainty around future guidance updates based on potential NCD outcomes, suggests a negative impact on Amgen's stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
