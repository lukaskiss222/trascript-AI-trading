Amgen reported strong Q1 financial results with revenues up 14% and adjusted EPS up 26%, raising full-year EPS guidance despite expected dilution from the Abgenix acquisition. The company's confidence in its pipeline, including the FDA filing for panitumumab and ongoing litigation to protect key products, is encouraging. While delays in the denosumab filing and slower Enbrel growth due to competition and reimbursement issues may raise concerns, the positive financial performance and increased guidance are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
