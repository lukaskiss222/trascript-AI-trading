Amgen's earnings call highlighted solid EPS growth and strong operating cash flow, despite a slight revenue decline in 2009. The company's optimistic guidance for 2010, anticipation of Prolia's approval and launch, and a robust pipeline with upcoming catalysts suggest positive momentum. Management's confident tone and focus on returning to top-line growth are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
