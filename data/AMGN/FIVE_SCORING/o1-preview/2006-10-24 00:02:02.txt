Amgen reported strong Q3 results with 15% revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth, raising EPS guidance for the second time this year. The successful launch of Vectibix, exceeding initial expectations, and strategic acquisitions like Avidia showcase robust future prospects. Despite some concerns with Enbrel's performance and regulatory delays for Aranesp, the overall positive financials and confident management tone suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
