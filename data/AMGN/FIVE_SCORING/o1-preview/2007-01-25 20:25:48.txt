Amgen reported strong financial results and optimistic guidance for 2007; however, negative clinical trial outcomes for key drugs like Aranesp and Sensipar raise concerns about safety and future sales. Additionally, potential competition and regulatory challenges may create short-term uncertainty for investors. Therefore, the stock could face negative sentiment in the near term.
