Amgen reported strong Q1 results with a 9% increase in revenues and a 20% rise in adjusted EPS, demonstrating solid operational performance. While the company expects full-year revenues and EPS at the low end of guidance due to healthcare reform impacts, management remains optimistic about upcoming product launches like Prolia and confident in managing expenses. The robust quarterly results and positive outlook on key products suggest a slight positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
