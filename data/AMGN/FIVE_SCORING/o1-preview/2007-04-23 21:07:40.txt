Amgen reported strong Q1 results but expressed significant uncertainty regarding future revenues for their key anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen, due to recent safety concerns, FDA label changes, and reimbursement issues. Management's adjustment of expense growth and cautious outlook signal potential short-term challenges. This uncertainty around core products is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and could lead to a substantial decline in the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
