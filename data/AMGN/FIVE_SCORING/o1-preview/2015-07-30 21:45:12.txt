Amgen reported strong second-quarter results, with revenue growth exceeding expectations and an upward revision of their 2015 guidance. Management's optimistic tone, coupled with positive developments in key product launches like Repatha and Kyprolis, suggests continued momentum. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
