Amgen's earnings call highlighted strong financial results and positive outcomes from the Repatha FOURIER trial, which met primary and key secondary endpoints with no new safety concerns. This validates Repatha's efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, potentially boosting its market adoption and revenue. The combination of robust financial performance and encouraging trial results is likely to drive a positive impact on Amgen's stock price in the short term.
