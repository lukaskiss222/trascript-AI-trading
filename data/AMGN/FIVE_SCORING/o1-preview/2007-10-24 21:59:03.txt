Amgen's earnings call highlights challenges in their anemia franchise due to regulatory and reimbursement changes, resulting in decreased sales. However, growth in products like Enbrel, progress in pipeline development, and effective cost-cutting measures show the company's adaptability. Overall, the mixed results suggest a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
