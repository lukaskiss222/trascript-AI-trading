Amgen's earnings call revealed a mixed outlook. While the company maintained EPS close to prior guidance despite challenges in the ESA franchise and reported positive data for Denosumab, their 2008 guidance is cautious with flat to slightly lower projected EPS. Upcoming regulatory risks, including potential label changes for ENBREL and the ODAC meeting on ESAs, may negatively influence investor sentiment in the short term.
