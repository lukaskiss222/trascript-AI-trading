Amgen reported strong third-quarter results, with 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted earnings per share growth, exceeding expectations and leading to raised guidance for the year. The successful launch of new products like Repatha and Kyprolis, combined with strong performance from key drugs such as Enbrel and Prolia, and an increased dividend and share repurchase authorization, signal positive momentum. Despite some concerns over higher tax rates and biosimilar competition, the overall outlook and strategic advancements are likely to positively impact the stock price in the short term.
