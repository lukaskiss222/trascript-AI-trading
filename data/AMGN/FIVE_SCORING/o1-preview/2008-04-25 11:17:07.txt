Amgenâ€™s Q1 earnings call highlighted significant declines in sales of key products like Aranesp and EPOGEN due to safety concerns and regulatory changes. Despite management's confidence in meeting revenue and EPS guidance and ongoing investments in pipeline products such as Denosumab and Nplate, the substantial drop in ESA sales and uncertainty over future label changes may negatively affect investor sentiment. In the short term, these challenges are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock price.
