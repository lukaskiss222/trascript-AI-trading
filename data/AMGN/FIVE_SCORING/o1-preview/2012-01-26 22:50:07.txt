Amgen reported strong financial results with increased revenues and earnings per share, exceeding expectations. The company's optimistic guidance for 2012, significant dividend increase, ongoing share repurchases, and strategic acquisition of Micromet to enhance their pipeline are likely to positively influence investor sentiment. These factors suggest a great positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
