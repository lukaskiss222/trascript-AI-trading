Amgen reported solid second-quarter results with revenues up 2% and EPS up 7% compared to the prior year. Management expressed confidence in their pipeline, particularly with the approvals and early launch of Prolia, but acknowledged headwinds from declining Aranesp sales and increased competition for Enbrel. The company's maintained EPS guidance and positive outlook are balanced by these challenges, suggesting a neutral short-term impact on the stock price.
