Amgen reported strong Q1 results with 10% revenue growth and increased 2016 revenue and EPS guidance. The company's solid performance across products, successful launches, and promising pipeline developments, particularly for Repatha and romosozumab, indicate positive momentum. These factors suggest the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
