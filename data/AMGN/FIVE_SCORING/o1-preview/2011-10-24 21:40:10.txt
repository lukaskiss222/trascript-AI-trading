Amgen reported solid Q3 results with revenues and EPS up 3%, and strong growth in key products excluding ESAs, leading to raised full-year guidance. The announcement of a $10 billion share repurchase program signals management's confidence and is likely to be well-received by investors. While there is a $780 million reserve for a legal settlement impacting GAAP EPS and declining EPOGEN sales, the overall positive financial performance and strategic initiatives suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
