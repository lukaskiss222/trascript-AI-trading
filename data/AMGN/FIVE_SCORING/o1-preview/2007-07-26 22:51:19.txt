Amgen's earnings call highlighted significant challenges in their anemia franchise, notably declining sales of Aranesp due to regulatory concerns and pending CMS decisions, leading to lower growth prospects. While positive developments with other products like Enbrel and Denosumab show potential, the uncertainty surrounding key revenue sources suggests short-term pressure on the stock price. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
