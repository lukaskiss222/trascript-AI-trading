Amgen’s Q2 earnings call highlighted stronger-than-expected financial performance, prompting an upward revision of revenue and earnings guidance for 2008. Positive data on Denosumab, showing significant efficacy in reducing fractures, and management's optimistic tone suggest a favorable short-term outlook. Despite potential headwinds from Aranesp sales due to label changes, the overall impact is likely positive for the stock in the next 1–2 weeks.
