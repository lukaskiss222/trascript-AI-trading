Amgen's earnings call highlights encouraging early adoption of TAVNEOS, with positive trends in patient starts, conversions, and repeat prescriptions.  While Q1 revenue is still nascent and subject to variable reimbursement and seasonality, management projects strong growth potential, particularly with the expansion of the product into other indications and the ongoing clinical development of CCX559.  Favorable early indicators point to a positive short-term trajectory for the stock.
