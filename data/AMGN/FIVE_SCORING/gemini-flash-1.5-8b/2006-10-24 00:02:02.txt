Amgen's earnings call highlighted continued strong growth, driven by Aranesp and a successful Vectibix launch.  Management raised guidance for adjusted EPS, indicating confidence in the company's performance.  However, concerns regarding the FDA's response to Amgen's Aranesp supplementary biologics license application and the lackluster performance of Enbrel relative to competitors warrant caution, potentially dampening short-term stock price gains.
