Amgen's earnings call highlighted continued growth in key products like Prolia, Evenity, Repatha, and Aimovig, partially offset by declines in mature products like Neulasta and Sensipar.  Management expressed confidence in the company's 2020 outlook, projecting a stable base business outside of Otezla, with Otezla expected to drive low double-digit growth.  The anticipated volume growth, alongside the company's innovative pipeline, suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price in the near term.
