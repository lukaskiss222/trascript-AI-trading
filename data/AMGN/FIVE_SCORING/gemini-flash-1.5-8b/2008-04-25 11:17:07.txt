Amgen's Q1 2008 earnings call highlighted a cautious outlook, despite strong performance in some areas like ENBREL and Sensipar.  The call emphasized the difficulty in year-over-year comparisons due to the tough comparison in the ESA franchise and the restructuring period. While management expressed confidence in achieving guidance, concerns about Aranesp and potentially new regulatory hurdles, specifically around the ESA labels, and reimbursement uncertainty suggest short-term volatility.  Uncertainty around product performance and the company's ability to navigate these issues might induce cautious investor sentiments in the near term.
