Amgen's Q1 2017 earnings call highlighted strong performance, particularly in newer product launches like Repatha and KYPROLIS, with volume-driven gains and margin improvements.  Management addressed concerns about Enbrel's Q1 performance as a temporary market issue, implying a return to growth in subsequent quarters, and emphasized the long-term potential of innovative products.  The positive outlook and management's focus on access and value-based pricing suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
