Amgen's Q2 2021 earnings call highlighted strong volume growth across multiple key products, particularly biosimilars and those with established market positions (Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY).  While management expressed confidence in their execution, a few caveats exist.  The call shows potential for continued downward pressure on net selling prices, particularly for certain products due to competition and Medicare Part D enrollment trends in the US.  This, coupled with the lingering impacts of the COVID pandemic on patient visits, suggests continued near-term market headwinds, but with a positive outlook on certain therapies like LUMAKRAS, and the acquisition of Teneobio further propelling the company's future development.
