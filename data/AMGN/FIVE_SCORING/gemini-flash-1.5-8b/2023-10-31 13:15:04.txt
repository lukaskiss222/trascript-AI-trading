Amgen's earnings call highlighted strong performance, especially in Repatha, EVENITY, and BLINCYTO.  The inclusion of Horizon Therapeutics' results, with a focus on potential growth for Tepezza, KRYSTEXXA, and others, will contribute positively.  The company issued higher guidance, which bodes well for the coming weeks. However, the increase is tempered by a projected lower Q4 EPS and higher interest expenses, along with higher R&D spending.
