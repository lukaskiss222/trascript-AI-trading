Amgen's Q1 2009 earnings call highlights significant economic headwinds impacting revenue, particularly in the US.  Lower patient demand, inventory adjustments, and unfavorable currency trends contributed to a 8% revenue decline.  While international performance held up relatively well, management expressed cautious optimism about the rest of the year, projecting revenue between $14.4-14.8B under the assumption of inventory normalization and growth across remaining segments.  The focus on patient affordability through co-pay programs and the potential effect of an ESA REMS program suggest a reactive approach to the current economic challenges.
