ChemoCentryx's earnings call highlights strong clinical data for avacopan, particularly in ANCA-associated vasculitis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa.  Management anticipates a successful FDA filing for avacopan in ANCA vasculitis and optimistic progress with the C3G trial, while potentially facing a slight delay in reporting on the AURORA trial due to COVID-19. The company's financial position is robust, giving them flexibility and resources for commercialization and further pipeline development.
