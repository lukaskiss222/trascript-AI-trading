Management highlights the solid performance of the core business, but uncertainties remain about the full reimbursement impact of Prolia, particularly within primary care physician adoption.  The call indicates that management is closely monitoring the situation and expects continued progress, but the full impact of reimbursement and other factors will likely take time to fully assess.
