Amgen's Q1 2021 earnings call highlighted continued strong performance of key products like Repatha, Prolia, and Evenity, driving volume growth.  Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, reflecting confidence in the company's pipeline and business development activities, such as the recent acquisition of Five Prime.  However, the call also acknowledged lingering COVID-19 impacts on the first and second quarter leading to a modest decrease in first-quarter sales compared to Q1 2020.
