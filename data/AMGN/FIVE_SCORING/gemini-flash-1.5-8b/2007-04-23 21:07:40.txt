Amgen's earnings call highlights continued strong performance across most product lines, particularly internationally.  However, uncertain guidance regarding Aranesp and EPOGEN sales, due to recent label changes and reimbursement issues, creates short-term risk for the stock. Management's emphasis on ongoing R&D and prudent expense management suggests a long-term outlook.  The stock likely faces some short-term pressure in the next 1-2 weeks due to the uncertainty regarding Aranesp and EPOGEN sales.
