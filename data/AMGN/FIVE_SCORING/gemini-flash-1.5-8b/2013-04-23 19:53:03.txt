Amgen's Q1 2013 earnings call highlighted strong revenue and EPS growth, driven by established products like Enbrel, XGEVA, and Prolia.  Management expressed confidence in the pipeline, particularly the encouraging TVEC data in melanoma, and projected continued growth.  However, the call also pointed to some challenges in the sequential performance of certain products and the increased operating expenses as well.  Investors will likely focus on the short-term implications of these factors, making the outlook somewhat mixed.
