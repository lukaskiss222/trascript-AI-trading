Amgen's Q1 2019 earnings call highlighted continued volume-driven growth, particularly for newer products like Repatha, Prolia, and Aimovig, exceeding expectations.  Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to defend mature products and capitalize on the pipeline's potential, while addressing concerns about drug pricing and biosimilar competition. The upward revision of 2019 guidance, combined with the  strong share performance of Repatha, suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
