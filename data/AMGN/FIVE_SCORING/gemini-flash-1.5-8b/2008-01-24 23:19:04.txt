Amgen's earnings call highlighted a resilient performance despite challenges in the ESA franchise.  Positive data from the Denosumab vs. Alendronate phase 3 trial, coupled with management's confidence in the future pipeline and ongoing efforts to address ESA issues, suggests a positive outlook for the short term.  The company's commitment to continued R&D, new molecule development, and existing products suggest solid growth potential in the next few weeks.
