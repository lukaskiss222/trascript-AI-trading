Amgen's Q1 2015 earnings call highlighted strong performance across various product lines, especially in Prolia, XGEVA, Kyprolis, and Enbrel.  Management raised 2015 guidance for revenue and EPS, driven by successful launches of BLINCYTO, Neulasta on-body injector, and the recent Corlanor approval.  Positive pipeline updates, including encouraging data for AMG 416, Kyprolis, and T-VEC, further reinforce the company's growth outlook. This suggests that stock will likely rally in the next few weeks.
