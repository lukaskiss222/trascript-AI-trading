Amgen's earnings call highlighted several positive aspects, including strong Vectibix launch, and continued growth in international markets.  However, mixed results from some Phase III trials, particularly negative data on Aranesp in the anemia of cancer setting, and the decision not to pursue Sensipar in a broader chronic kidney disease patient group, suggest some potential short-term headwinds. The overall tone of management is cautiously optimistic, but the negative data points could create some uncertainty in the short term.
