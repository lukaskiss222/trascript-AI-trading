Amgen's earnings call highlighted strong demand-driven revenue growth, particularly for Aranesp, leading to an upward EPS guidance revision.  Management emphasized continued investment in R&D and a robust pipeline, but also expressed caution regarding the cholecystitis safety signal observed in the AMG 706 trial, which will likely delay anticipated Phase III trials.  These factors could lead to short-term uncertainty regarding the stock's trajectory.
