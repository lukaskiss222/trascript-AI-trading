Amgen's earnings call highlights ongoing challenges in the anemia franchise, particularly with Aranesp, due to evolving physician behavior and reimbursement pressures.  Management emphasizes a cautious approach, adjusting costs and focusing on pipeline development, acquisitions, and share buybacks.  While delivering EPS growth in line with guidance, the uncertain outlook stemming from pending regulatory decisions and market responses (including the NCD and CRDAC) leaves the company's short-term stock performance susceptible to volatility.
