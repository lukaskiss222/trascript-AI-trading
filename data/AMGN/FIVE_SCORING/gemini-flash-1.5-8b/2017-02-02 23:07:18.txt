Amgen's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 2016 results and positive Repatha trial data.  The positive cardiovascular outcomes data is likely to drive significant investor interest and potentially increase stock value in the short term as payers begin to offer more access.  The company also provided encouraging guidance for 2017, suggesting continued growth, but with some cautious factors, such as biosimilar competition and a potentially wide variance in revenue depending on the Repatha trial's reception.
