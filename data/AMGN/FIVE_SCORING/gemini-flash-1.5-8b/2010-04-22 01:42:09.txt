Amgen's Q1 2010 earnings call highlighted strong performance, with revenue and adjusted EPS exceeding expectations.  Management discussed the impact of healthcare reform, projecting a $200-$250 million impact on 2010 earnings, and noted that the company is taking steps to mitigate these costs.  Their optimism for the future, especially regarding Prolia, and the robust acquisition of share information suggests a positive short-term stock impact, though cost increases may be a temporary drag.
