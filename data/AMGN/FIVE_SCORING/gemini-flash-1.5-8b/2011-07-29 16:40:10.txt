Amgen's earnings call highlighted robust growth in product sales (8%), exceeding expectations,  and management expressed confidence in reaching the upper end of their guidance range.  The call also underscored continued investment in R&D, with specific progress in Phase III trials, supporting future growth. However,  the EPOGEN sales decline, attributed to the bundled payment system,  remains a potential concern, although the company believes this impact will largely be realized in 2011 and that patient population growth and price increases will provide mitigation.
