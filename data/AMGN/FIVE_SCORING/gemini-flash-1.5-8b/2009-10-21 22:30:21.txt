Amgen's earnings call highlights strong Q3 results, exceeding expectations and leading to revised upward EPS guidance.  Management expresses confidence in the future, particularly in Vectibix and Prolia's potential despite regulatory hurdles.  The call's focus on data analysis, particularly for Aranesp, suggests a short-term focus on clarifying the product's future, which could imply some stock volatility over the next few weeks as investors digest the information.
