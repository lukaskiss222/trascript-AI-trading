Amgen's earnings call highlighted significant progress in several clinical trials, particularly for CCX140 in diabetic nephropathy and CCX872 in pancreatic cancer.  Positive Phase II results for CCX140, showing substantial eGFR improvement, suggest strong potential for a Phase III trial.  The company plans to discuss the Phase III design with regulatory agencies and potentially seek accelerated approval.  This positive outlook, combined with ongoing clinical trials, suggests a strong likelihood of positive investor sentiment in the short term.
