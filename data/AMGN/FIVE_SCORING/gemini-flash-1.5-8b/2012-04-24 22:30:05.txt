Amgen's Q1 2012 earnings call highlighted strong revenue and EPS growth, exceeding expectations.  Management emphasized continued momentum in key franchises like Neulasta, Enbrel, and Prolia/XGEVA, offsetting declines in the ESA business.  The positive tone and continued investments in R&D, acquisitions, and the pipeline suggest a positive outlook for the stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
