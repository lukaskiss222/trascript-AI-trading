Amgen's Q1 2011 earnings call highlighted several key factors.  While revenues grew modestly, operating expenses saw a significant 13% increase due to investments in new product launches (Prolia and XGEVA), increased R&D efforts, and Healthcare Reform and Puerto Rico excise tax fees.  Management emphasized these investments as crucial for future growth but acknowledged potential short-term impact on earnings.  A key takeaway suggests that investors should focus on an upcoming business review for more detail on long-term strategies and capital allocation, as opposed to this call's information being impactful for the short-term.
