Amgen's earnings call highlighted a strong Q4 performance driven by new product launches (Prolia and XGEVA) and positive pipeline updates.  Management's guidance for 2011 anticipates continued growth, albeit with tempered expectations due to healthcare reform costs and some projected moderate decline in EPOGEN sales.  The optimistic tone surrounding the pipeline, particularly the BioVex acquisition, and strong performance of Prolia and XGEVA suggest a positive medium-term outlook.
