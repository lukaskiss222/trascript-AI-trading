Amgen's earnings call highlighted strong Q3 performance, exceeding expectations with 14% revenue growth and 18% adjusted EPS growth.  Management raised 2015 guidance and provided preliminary 2016 guidance, generally in line with expectations but with some nuance related to tax rate assumptions and biosimilar competition.  The positive tone and continued focus on innovation, particularly the successful launches of Repatha and Kyprolis, should support positive stock performance in the short term.
