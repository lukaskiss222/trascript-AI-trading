**Analysis:**

The earnings call revealed that Microsoft is facing a challenging economic environment, with the PC market and overall demand for technology products declining. The company has taken significant steps to reduce expenses, including a plan to cut up to 5,000 jobs and reduce operating expenses by $1.5 billion for the fiscal year 2009. Despite these cost-cutting measures, the company has also indicated that it will continue to invest in key strategic opportunities and its product pipeline. The call also addressed the potential for mergers and acquisitions, with the company indicating that it will continue to look for opportunities to buy small to medium-sized businesses. Overall, the call provided a mixed picture of the company's performance and future prospects, with some positive signs but also significant headwinds.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the company's reduced guidance, cost-cutting measures, and the overall challenging economic environment. The stock may experience further pressure as investors assess the company's ability to navigate the current economic conditions and maintain its competitive position. However, the company's focus on innovation and strategic investments could provide some support for the stock price over the longer term.

**Rating:** -1
