**Analysis:**
Microsoft's Q2 results show solid growth in cloud services, with Office 365 and Azure continuing to drive revenue. The company also made progress in its hardware portfolio, including Surface Pro 3 and Lumia phones. However, the company faced challenges in Japan and China due to macroeconomic factors and the impact of Windows XP end-of-life. The company's guidance for Q3 projects growth in cloud services and hardware, but also expects a slowdown in commercial licensing due to the end of the Windows XP refresh cycle. The company's strategy to expand its services across all devices and platforms suggests long-term growth potential, but the near-term outlook is mixed due to the challenges in Japan and China and the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar.

**Conclusion:**
The stock price is likely to experience short-term volatility due to the mixed outlook for the near term, but the long-term potential of the company's cloud services and hardware portfolio suggests a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks. The rating is 1.
