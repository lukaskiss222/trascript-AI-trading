Based on the transcript, Microsoft reported strong Q2 results with revenue growth of 6% and operating income growth of 10%. The company exceeded its guidance for the quarter, driven by robust demand for Windows Vista, Office 2007, and Xbox 360. The company's guidance for the full year and the third quarter was also positive, with revenue expected to grow 13% to 14% and 26% to 28% respectively. The company's management was optimistic about the future, highlighting the potential for growth in non-defense markets and cost-saving measures. However, there were some concerns about the company's ability to maintain its growth momentum in the face of increased competition and regulatory challenges. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
