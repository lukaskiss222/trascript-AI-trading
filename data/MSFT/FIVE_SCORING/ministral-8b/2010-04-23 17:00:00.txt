Based on the earnings call transcript, Microsoft Corporation delivered strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. The company reported record revenue and operating cash flow, driven by robust demand for Windows 7 and other products. Management expressed optimism about the company's product pipeline and the potential for continued revenue growth. However, the guidance for the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year suggested a more cautious outlook, with potential headwinds from deferred revenue and the impact of the Tech Guarantee program. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the mixed signals from the guidance and the uncertainty around the impact of the Tech Guarantee program on unearned revenue.
