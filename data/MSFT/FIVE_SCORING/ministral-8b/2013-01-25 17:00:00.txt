### Analysis:
Microsoft's Q2 2013 earnings call provided a mixed bag of news for investors. The company reported record revenue and earnings per share, driven by strong performance in Windows, enterprise services, and the cloud. Key highlights included the launch of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, which contributed significantly to the revenue growth. However, there were some concerns about the transition to Windows 8 and the need to drive more app development. The call also discussed the potential for Surface to become a significant revenue driver in the future. Overall, while the results were strong, the future trajectory is uncertain due to the ongoing transition to Windows 8 and the need for more app development.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong quarterly results and the potential for long-term growth in the cloud and enterprise services. However, the transition to Windows 8 and the need for more app development could pose risks in the coming quarters.
