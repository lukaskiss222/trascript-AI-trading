Based on the earnings transcript, Microsoft reported strong Q2 results with record revenue and profits, driven by Windows 7 and PC sales. The company maintained its outlook for the remainder of the year, expecting revenue to grow in line with the PC market. Management highlighted the momentum of Windows 7 and the upcoming releases of Office 2010 and Natal. The stock is likely to experience short-term volatility due to potential concerns over enterprise spending and the integration of the Yahoo! partnership. However, long-term growth prospects remain positive.
