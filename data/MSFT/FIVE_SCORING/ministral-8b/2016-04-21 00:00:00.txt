### Analysis

Microsoft's Q3 2016 earnings report reveals strong growth in cloud services, particularly Azure, with a significant increase in revenue and user base. The company's focus on reinventing its productivity and business process offerings, expanding into new markets like security and analytics, and growing its developer platform are all positive signs. However, the company faces challenges in the PC market and has experienced a decline in transactional revenue. The guidance for the next quarter and the fiscal year remains conservative, reflecting the company's cautious approach to revenue recognition and margins.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Microsoft's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The strong performance in the cloud segment, particularly Azure, and the company's strategic focus on reinventing its business processes and expanding into new markets are likely to be seen positively by investors. However, the decline in transactional revenue and the conservative guidance may temper any immediate enthusiasm. Overall, the stock is likely to remain stable in the short term.
