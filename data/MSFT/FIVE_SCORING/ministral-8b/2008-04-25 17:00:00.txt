### Analysis

Microsoft's Q3 earnings report demonstrated strong performance across various business units, with revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 27% despite a challenging economic environment. The company's diversified revenue streams, particularly in the client and online services divisions, drove significant growth. However, the guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 shows a more conservative outlook, with revenue growth expected to be in the range of 11% to 13%. The company's strategy to expand in high-growth markets and investments in products like Xbox 360 and Windows Server 2008 are expected to contribute to growth. The proposed acquisition of Yahoo, while potentially accelerating growth, is not seen as critical to the company's long-term strategy. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the economic uncertainty and the potential impact of the Yahoo acquisition.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the economic uncertainty and the potential impact of the Yahoo acquisition. The company's strong performance in the third quarter and the diversified revenue streams suggest long-term potential, but the near-term outlook is cautious.
