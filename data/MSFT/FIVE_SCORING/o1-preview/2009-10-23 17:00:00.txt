Microsoft's earnings call highlighted strong consumer demand for Windows and Xbox products, with record Windows license sales, especially ahead of the Windows 7 launch. While revenue was down 4% due to weakness in business spending, management expressed optimism about future growth, cost control measures, and potential improvement in business spending next year. The positive momentum from the Windows 7 launch and strong consumer demand are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
