Microsoft's earnings call highlighted significant challenges in its Windows division, including a $900 million charge due to Surface RT inventory adjustments and ongoing declines in the consumer PC market. While the enterprise and cloud segments showed strong growth, the substantial write-down and cautious guidance signal short-term headwinds. As a result, the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
