Microsoft reported record revenue and profit, driven by strong consumer demand for Windows 7, which has become the fastest-selling operating system in history. The management's optimistic tone about upcoming product releases like Office 2010, Azure, and Natal, along with continued growth in Bing's market share, indicates positive momentum. Despite soft enterprise spending, the strong financial performance and positive outlook suggest the stock will experience a short-term positive impact.
