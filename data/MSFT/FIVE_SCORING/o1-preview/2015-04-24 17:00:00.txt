Microsoft's earnings call reveals strong performance in cloud services, with significant growth in Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM, indicating successful transformation efforts. Despite currency headwinds and challenges in the phone business and Japanese market, the company's expense control, increased capital return to shareholders, and optimism around the upcoming Windows 10 launch suggest positive momentum. These factors are likely to lead to a rally in the stock price in the short term.
