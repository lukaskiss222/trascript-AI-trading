Microsoft's Q2 earnings exceeded expectations, with strong revenue and EPS driven by robust sales of Xbox One, Surface devices, and significant growth in cloud services. Despite some margin pressure and declines in traditional segments like Windows non-Pro and consumer Office licensing, the company's positive momentum in key growth areas suggests investors will react favorably. Therefore, the stock is likely to rally in the short term.
