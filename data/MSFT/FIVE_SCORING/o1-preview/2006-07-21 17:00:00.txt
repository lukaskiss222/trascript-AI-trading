Microsoft reported strong Q4 and fiscal year 2006 results, returning to double-digit revenue growth. The company provided positive guidance for fiscal 2007, expecting continued revenue and EPS growth driven by upcoming launches of Windows Vista and Office 2007. Additionally, the announcement of a $20 billion tender offer and authorization of an additional $20 billion stock repurchase demonstrates management's confidence, which is likely to positively impact the stock price in the short term.
