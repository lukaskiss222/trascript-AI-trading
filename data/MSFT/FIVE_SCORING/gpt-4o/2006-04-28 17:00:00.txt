Microsoft's Q3 2006 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth, driven by popular new products and robust demand for PC and server hardware. Despite lower-than-expected operating income due to legal charges, the company experienced impressive sales in recently launched products, such as Xbox 360 and SQL Server, and positive momentum is expected to continue in Q4. However, the aggressive investment strategy, particularly for Windows Vista and Office 2007 launches, along with the associated marketing and readiness costs, suggests limited operating income growth relative to revenue expansion. Overall, the strong product performance is likely to support a positive short-term stock impact.
