Microsoft's Q3 2012 earnings report shows solid financial performance with record revenue and operating income growth driven by enterprise products and services. The growth in multi-year licensing and strong enterprise agreement renewals indicate robust business demand. However, the softer gaming console market represents a potential downside. The upcoming product launches, including Windows 8, Office 15, and Windows Server 2012, alongside steady enterprise demand, position Microsoft well for continued momentum. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact over the short term due to these strong financials and promising outlook.
