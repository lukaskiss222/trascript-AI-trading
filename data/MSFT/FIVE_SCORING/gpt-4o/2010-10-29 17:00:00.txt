Microsoft reported a strong first quarter fiscal year 2011 with record revenue, operating income, and EPS. Key growth areas included Office 2010, Windows 7, and Xbox, with robust adoption in both consumer and business segments. Management's positive tone and reaffirmation of cost discipline, combined with increased shareholder returns and optimistic guidance on emerging markets and cloud services, suggest a continuation of this momentum. Consequently, the stock is likely to experience a modest positive impact in the short term as investors react to the strong financial performance and growth prospects.
