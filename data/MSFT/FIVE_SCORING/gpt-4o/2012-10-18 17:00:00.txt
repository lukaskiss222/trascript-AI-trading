Microsoft's earnings call highlighted several factors suggesting mixed implications for its stock in the short term. The revenue was flat year-over-year with notable declines in OEM business due to a challenging PC market ahead of Windows 8 launch, which could present short-term headwinds. However, the excitement around the Windows 8 and Surface launches, along with double-digit growth in multiyear licensing and strong bookings, reflects underlying strength in enterprise commitments and potential for a positive turnaround. The mixed results and upcoming launches likely balance the short-term outlook on the stock price.
