Microsoftâ€™s Q3 earnings report was robust, with revenue, operating income, and EPS all surpassing expectations, driving strong double-digit growth. The successful launch of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System contributed to a 32% revenue growth, revealing a positive market response. The management's optimistic guidance for Q4 and FY 2008, alongside proactive share repurchasing and sustained product innovation, positions the company for a strong performance. This favorable outlook is likely to positively impact the stock price in the short term.
