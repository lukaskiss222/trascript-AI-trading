The transcript for Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 second quarter earnings call presents several key points that could influence the short-term impact on the company's stock price:

1. **Record Revenue and Earnings**: Microsoft reported record revenue of $22 billion and record earnings per share of $0.81, which is generally positive news[1()[3’.

2. **Strong Enterprise Performance**: The company saw strong demand for its business products and services, with significant growth in multiyear licensing and robust performances from SQL Server, SharePoint, Exchange, and Lync. This indicates a solid foundation in the enterprise segment[1()[3’.

3. **Windows 8 and Surface**: While Windows 8 launch was described as a "big, bold re-imagining" of Windows, the initial market response was mixed. However, the company is working to improve the ecosystem, expand distribution of Surface, and bring more devices to market at various price points. This long-term strategy may not immediately boost short-term performance but sets a positive trajectory[1()[3’.

4. **Cost and Expense Management**: Operating expenses grew 10%, mainly due to marketing for product launches, but the company reaffirmed its full fiscal year operating expense guidance, indicating control over costs[1/.

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year remained generally positive, with expectations of continued growth in key segments and managed expenses. However, the recognition of deferred revenues and the impact of inventory levels could affect short-term financials[1/.

Given these points, here are the main reasoning and the predicted impact:

- The record revenue and strong enterprise performance are positive indicators.
- The mixed response to Windows 8 and the need for continued ecosystem development might temper short-term enthusiasm.
- The company's focus on cost management and the reaffirmed guidance suggest stability and future growth potential.

### Conclusion
The overall picture is one of stability and long-term growth potential, but with some short-term adjustments due to the Windows 8 transition and inventory dynamics.
