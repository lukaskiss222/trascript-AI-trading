The Microsoft first quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2008 presented several positive indicators that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the company's stock.

### Key Positives
- **Strong Revenue and Operating Income Growth**: Revenue increased by 27%, and operating income grew by 32%, exceeding expectations. This robust growth was driven by strong performance across all business segments, including client, server and tools, Microsoft Business Division, and entertainment and devices[4].
- **Improved Guidance**: Microsoft increased its revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for the full year, reflecting confidence in their ongoing performance and the positive impact of recent acquisitions like aQuantive[4].
- **Solid Execution and Cost Control**: The company maintained cost discipline despite higher-than-expected revenue, allowing a significant portion of the revenue upside to flow through to operating income[4].
- **Healthy Demand and Market Expansion**: Strong demand in emerging markets, robust PC hardware market growth, and successful product launches (e.g., Halo 3, Windows Vista) contributed to the company's performance. The premium mix of Windows Vista and Office products also saw significant growth[4].

### Conclusion
Given these strong financial results, improved guidance, and successful product launches, it is likely that Microsoft's stock will experience a positive impact in the short term.
