Microsoft's Q2 FY2015 earnings call revealed several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Growth**: Microsoft reported an 8% increase in revenue to $26.5 billion, driven by strong growth in cloud services, including Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online. However, the year-over-year comparables were impacted by the end of the Windows XP refresh cycle and foreign exchange headwinds[2][3][4].

2. **Challenges**: The company faced challenges in certain geographies, such as China and Japan, due to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. These challenges, combined with the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to continue affecting revenue growth in the upcoming quarters[2][3][4].

3. **Cloud Momentum**: Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue continued to grow at a triple-digit rate, reaching an annualized run rate of $5.5 billion. This strong cloud performance is a positive indicator for future growth[2][3][4].

4. **Hardware Performance**: The Surface Pro 3 and Lumia phone sales showed significant growth, but other hardware segments, such as Xbox and non-Lumia phones, faced declines or challenges[2][3][4].

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company adjusted its full-year operating expense guidance downward and expects additional restructuring expenses, but remains committed to increasing capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends[2][3][4].

Given these points, here are the key factors influencing the short-term stock price:

- **Positive Cloud Growth**: Strong cloud revenue growth is a significant positives.
- **Geographic Challenges**: Weakness in China and Japan, along with foreign exchange impacts, are short-term negatives.
- **Hardware Mixed Performance**: While Surface and Lumia showed strength, other hardware segments faced challenges.
- **Guidance Adjustments**: Adjusted guidance and expected restructuring expenses could create short-term uncertainty.

Overall, the strong cloud performance and continued innovation in key areas are likely to offset some of the short-term challenges, but the immediate impact from geographic and FX issues might keep the stock from rallying significantly in the next 1-2 weeks.
