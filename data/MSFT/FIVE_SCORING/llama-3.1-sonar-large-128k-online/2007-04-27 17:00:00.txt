Microsoft's Q3 2007 earnings call and the subsequent guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 indicate several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Microsoft exceeded expectations in revenue, operating income, and earnings per share, driven by the successful launches of Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System. This strong performance is likely to boost investor confidence[1/.

2. **Robust Guidance**: The company raised its revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2007 and provided optimistic guidance for fiscal year 2008, including revenue growth of 11% to 12% and earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%. This positive outlook suggests continued growth and stability[1][2].

3. **Healthy Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns**: Microsoft reported record cash flow from operations and significant returns to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which is attractive to investors[1][2].

4. **Product Cycle and Market Strength**: The company is in a strong product cycle with multiple product launches planned for fiscal year 2008, and it continues to see strength across all customer segments and regions. This indicates a robust underlying business and promising future prospects[1][2].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
