The earnings transcript for Microsoft Corporation's Q3 2014 indicates several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Signals:
- Strong momentum in cloud services, with Commercial Cloud revenue more than doubling year-over-year, driven by Office 365 and Azure growth[3].
- Increased subscription numbers for Office 365 Home, now at 4.4 million subscribers, and strong renewal rates[3].
- Growth in Windows Pro and volume licensing revenues, partly driven by the end of Windows XP support[3].
- Improved search revenue and market share for Bing[3].
- Strong financial performance, including solid revenue and earnings per share, despite some margin pressures due to hardware sales[3].

## Mixed Signals:
- The upcoming integration of Nokia's Devices and Services segment introduces uncertainty, as Microsoft has not provided detailed guidance on the impact of this acquisition on future financials[3].
- Some decline expected in the benefits from Windows XP End of Support in the next quarter, which could moderate the growth in Windows licensing revenue[3].
- Margin pressures in the hardware segment, particularly from Xbox One console sales[3].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong execution and growth in strategic areas such as cloud services. However, there are some short-term uncertainties related to the Nokia acquisition and moderation in some revenue streams.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong cloud services growth, solid financial performance, and the company's focus on innovation and execution.
