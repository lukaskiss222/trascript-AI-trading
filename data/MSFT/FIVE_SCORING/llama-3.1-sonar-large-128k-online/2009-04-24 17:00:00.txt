The Microsoft Q3 FY2009 earnings call highlights several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Revenue and Earnings**: Microsoft reported a 6% decline in revenue and a 30% decline in earnings per share, largely due to a weak global economic environment. However, the company managed to offset some of the revenue pressure with significant cost-saving initiatives[1][4].

2. **Cost Control and Efficiency**: The company implemented robust cost-cutting measures, reducing operating expenses by $1.3 billion, which helped mitigate the impact of reduced revenue. This efficiency and fiscal discipline are seen as positive factors[4].

3. **Annuity Business Strength**: The annuity licensing business remained strong, providing a stable source of revenue. This segment continued to grow and partially insulated the company from the broader economic downturn[4].

4. **Product Pipeline**: Microsoft is set to release several major products, including Windows 7, Office 2010, and Windows Server 2008 R2, which are expected to drive growth in the future. However, these releases are occurring in a challenging economic environment[4].

5. **Guidance and Outlook**: The company expects difficult trading conditions to continue through the next quarter and potentially through the balance of the calendar year. However, they are optimistic about the long-term outlook due to their diversified business model and upcoming product releases[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the following:

- **Weak Revenue and Earnings**: The decline in revenue and earnings per share, despite cost-cutting efforts, is a near-term negative.
- **Challenging Economic Environment**: The continued expectation of difficult trading conditions through the next quarter and beyond may weigh on investor sentiment.
- **Delayed Recovery**: The belief that economic recovery will be slow and gradual may also dampen short-term expectations.

However, the strong execution on cost initiatives, the resilience of the annuity business, and the promising product pipeline suggest that the long-term outlook remains positive.
