The Microsoft 2007 fiscal year first quarter conference call presents several key points that can influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Strong Financial Performance
Microsoft reported strong financial results, with revenue growing 11%, operating income up modestly, and EPS exceeding expectations. This solid performance is likely to positively impact investor sentiment.

## Product Launches and Customer Acceptance
The company made significant progress on major product milestones, including Windows Vista, Office 2007, and Xbox 360, which are expected to drive revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Positive feedback from customers and partners on these products is a positive indicator.

## Guidance and Revenue Deferrals
Microsoft provided guidance that includes revenue deferrals due to technology guarantee programs, which affects the second-quarter revenue but does not impact full-year numbers. This technical accounting adjustment might cause short-term volatility but does not change the overall positive outlook.

## Investment and Shareholder Returns
The company continued to execute on its strategy of returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is generally viewed positively by investors.

## Risks and Uncertainties
Despite the positive outlook, there are risks mentioned, such as execution risks on product launches, customer acceptance uncertainties, and potential increases in costs associated with online services. However, these risks are balanced by potential upside from strong customer demand and market growth.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, reflecting strong financial performance, promising product launches, and a commitment to shareholder value. However, the short-term impact might be slightly muted due to the technical accounting adjustments and deferrals.

### Rating: 1
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance and positive outlook, despite some minor short-term adjustments and risks.
