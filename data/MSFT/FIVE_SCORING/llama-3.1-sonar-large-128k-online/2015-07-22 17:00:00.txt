The earnings transcript for Microsoft's Q4 2015 reveals several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Indicators
- Strong cloud performance: Microsoft's commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $8 billion, with an 88% year-over-year growth. This indicates robust momentum in a critical growth area[2][3][5].
- Growth in Hardware and Services: Surface revenue more than doubled, and Xbox revenue grew 27%, showing strength in Microsoft's hardware and gaming segments[2][3][5].
- Office 365 and Dynamics: Significant growth in Office 365 subscriptions and Dynamics CRM, with a strong install base and increasing market opportunity[5].
- Cost Discipline: Microsoft demonstrated disciplined cost management, reducing operating expenses while investing in growth areas[5].

### Challenges and Uncertainties
- Impairment Charges: The significant $8.4 billion impairment charge related to the Nokia acquisition and restructuring expenses negatively impacted the quarter's financials[2][3][5].
- Foreign Currency Impact: The strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to continue impacting revenue negatively, especially in the first half of FY 2016[5].
- Phone Segment: Microsoft is expecting significant revenue declines in the phone segment due to a more focused approach, which may lead to short-term revenue pressure[5].

### Guidance
- Microsoft's guidance for FY 2016 includes expectations for continued growth in cloud and commercial segments, despite FX headwinds. The company is on track to achieve its $20 billion commercial cloud ambition by FY 2018[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Microsoft's stock is likely to be positive due to the strong cloud and hardware performance, despite the near-term challenges from impairment charges and foreign currency impacts. The company's strategic focus, cost discipline, and optimistic outlook for future growth are key positives.
