- **Strong Product Adoption**: Windows 7 has sold over 60 million licenses, making it the fastest-selling operating system in history. Additionally, Office 2010 beta has been well-received, and Xbox Live membership has grown significantly[1][2][4].
- **Positive Outlook**: The company anticipates improving IT spending in 2010, with expectations of a business hardware refresh cycle starting in the calendar year. This, combined with a strong product pipeline including Windows 7, Office 2010, and Natal, positions the company well for future growth[1][4].
- **Effective Cost Management**: Microsoft has been diligent in managing costs, with operating expenses increasing only 1% and a reduction in headcount by 8% year-over-year[1].
