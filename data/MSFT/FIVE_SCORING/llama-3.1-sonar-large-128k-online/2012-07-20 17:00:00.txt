Microsoft's Q4 2012 earnings call presented a mixed picture but with several positive indicators for the short term. Here are the key points:

## Strong Financial Performance
Despite a significant goodwill impairment charge related to the aQuantive acquisition, Microsoft reported record fourth-quarter and full-year revenue. Adjusted non-GAAP figures showed revenue, operating income, and earnings per share increases of 7%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the prior year[1][2][3â€™.

## Product and Market Momentum
The company saw strong growth in its Server & Tools and Microsoft Business Divisions, driven by enterprise demand for products like SQL Server, System Center, and Office 2010. The upcoming launch of Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, and the next version of Office is expected to drive further growth[1][3].

## Cloud and Enterprise Focus
Microsoft highlighted its focus on cloud solutions, with significant investments in Azure, Office 365, and other cloud services. This strategic direction is expected to continue driving long-term growth[3].

## Challenges and Outlook
While the Windows & Windows Live Division saw a decline due to the deferral of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, the company expects Windows 8 to drive the PC ecosystem forward. The Online Services Division, despite growth, has lower expectations for future profitability due to the aQuantive writedown[1][2][3].

## Short-Term Impact
The positive momentum in key business segments, the upcoming major product launches, and the strong enterprise demand are likely to offset the short-term negative impacts from the goodwill impairment and revenue deferrals. The market is likely to react positively to the company's solid financial performance and promising outlook.
