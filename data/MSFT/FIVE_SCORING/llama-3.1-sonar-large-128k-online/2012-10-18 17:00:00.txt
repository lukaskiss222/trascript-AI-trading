The transcript of Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2013 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call presents a mixed bag of signals that could impact the stock price in the short term:

- **Positive Factors**:
  - Microsoft reported flat revenue but strong growth in multiyear licensing, particularly in the Server & Tools and Microsoft Business Divisions. This indicates long-term commitments from enterprise customers, which is a positive sign[3]).
  - The company saw significant growth in cloud services, including Office 365, Windows Azure, and Dynamics CRM, which aligns with their strategic focus on cloud computing.
  - The upcoming launch of Windows 8 and Surface, along with other product launches, is expected to drive future growth and innovation.
  - Strong bookings and revenue growth in the Server & Tools division, driven by multiyear licensing agreements, suggest robust demand for Microsoft's enterprise products[3].

- **Negative Factors**:
  - The PC market decline and economic challenges, particularly in Europe, impacted transactional revenue. This slowdown ahead of the Windows 8 launch and competitive pressures in the PC market could continue to affect short-term performance.
  - The Windows division revenue declined by 9%, largely due to OEM inventory drawdowns before the Windows 8 launch, which might concern investors about immediate revenue growth.
  - The console market remains challenged, and while Xbox maintained a strong market share, the overall Entertainment and Devices division revenue declined slightly[3].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive. The company's strong long-term positioning, particularly in cloud services and enterprise products, offsets some of the short-term challenges in the PC market and consumer segment.
