Microsoft's Q4 FY2007 earnings call and the subsequent guidance for FY2008 suggest several key points that will influence the stock's short-term performance:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Microsoft reported a strong finish to FY2007, with double-digit revenue, operating income, and EPS growth. This robust performance sets a positive backdrop for the upcoming year[3].

2. **Guidance and Expectations**: The company provided optimistic guidance for FY2008, expecting revenue growth of 11% to 13%, and operating income and EPS growth even higher. However, some segments, like client and server and tools, may see slightly moderated growth due to various factors such as premium mix changes and strong comparables from the previous year[3].

3. **Product Lineup and Launches**: Microsoft is poised for another significant launch year in FY2008, with important products in business intelligence, unified communications, security, and business applications. This could maintain investor enthusiasm and support for the stock[3].

4. **Xbox and Online Services**: The entertainment and devices division is expected to see significant growth, particularly with the launch of Halo 3 and other gaming titles. Online services are also projected to grow, albeit with some deceleration in the initial quarters[3].

5. **Macro Environment and Customer Adoption**: Microsoft is seeing strength in emerging markets and a healthy PC hardware market. However, the overall macro environment is not significantly changing, and customer spending patterns are relatively stable, which could support stable stock performance[3].

Given these points, here are the key takeaways for the short-term impact on Microsoft's stock:

- **Positive Financial Performance**: Strong earnings and revenue growth typically support stock prices.
- **Optimistic Guidance**: Positive outlook for FY2008, despite some segmental nuances, is generally positive.
- **Product Launches and Market Opportunities**: New product launches and growth in key segments like online services and gaming are positive indicators.
- **Macro Stability**: No significant unexpected impacts from macroeconomic factors or customer spending patterns.

However, there are some minor concerns about the deceleration in certain business segments and the impact of premium mix changes, but these are not likely to overshadow the overall positive sentiment.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, optimistic guidance, and promising product lineup.
