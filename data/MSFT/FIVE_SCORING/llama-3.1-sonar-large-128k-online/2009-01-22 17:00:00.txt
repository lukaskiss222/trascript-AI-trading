The transcript of Microsoft's fiscal year 2009 second-quarter earnings call reveals several key points that are likely to impact the company's stock price in the short term:

## Economic Environment and Revenue
- The global economic downturn significantly affected Microsoft's revenue, particularly in the client business segment, with an 8% decline due to weakness in the traditional PC market.
- Despite this, the company managed to grow revenue by 2%, albeit below expectations, and reduced operating expenses to mitigate the impact.

## Cost Cutting and Expense Management
- Microsoft announced significant cost-cutting measures, including reducing up to 5,000 positions, eliminating pay raises for the next fiscal year, and reducing vendor, marketing, and capital expenditures. These actions are expected to save $1.5 billion in operating expenses and $700 million in capital expenditures for the fiscal year.

## Guidance and Outlook
- Due to economic uncertainty, Microsoft did not provide quantitative revenue or earnings per share guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, they provided operating expense guidance and outlined a framework for understanding the business drivers.

## Market and Product Performance
- Strong performance in the Server and Tools division and the Entertainment and Devices division, particularly with Xbox 360 console sales, were highlights. However, the online services business saw flat revenue, and the PC market's weakness was a major concern.

## Management's Tone
- Management expressed a cautious but proactive stance, focusing on fiscal discipline, efficiency, and strategic investments despite the challenging economic environment. They emphasized the importance of innovation, market share, and efficient resource allocation.

Given these points, here are the short-term implications for Microsoft's stock:

- The immediate reaction to the earnings call might be negative due to the lower-than-expected revenue, the weak PC market, and the announcement of significant job cuts.
- However, the robust cost-cutting measures and the company's commitment to investing in strategic areas could provide some stability and long-term optimism.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price is likely to be negative due to the current economic conditions, reduced revenue expectations, and job cuts, despite the company's efforts to manage expenses and maintain strategic investments.
