Microsoft's Q4 FY2016 earnings call presented several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Cloud Performance**: Microsoft's cloud segment, particularly Azure, showed significant growth, with Azure revenue increasing by 102% and commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeding $12.1 billion. This strong performance is a positive indicator[1][2][4].

2. **Annuity Growth and Transactional Volatility**: The company emphasized a structural shift towards annuity-based revenue, which is more stable, while transactional business remains volatile due to macroeconomic factors. This transition is seen as a long-term positive but may introduce short-term volatility[4].

3. **Guidance and Outlook**: The guidance for the next quarter and fiscal year 2017 was generally positive, with expectations of continued cloud growth, improved commercial cloud gross margins, and stable overall gross margins. However, there are notes on potential FX impacts and macroeconomic uncertainties[4].

4. **Operational Efficiency and Investments**: Microsoft highlighted cost-saving measures, reduced Phone expenses, and significant investments in cloud capacity, which are expected to yield benefits in the future. The company also returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, a positive signal for investors[4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call was positive, with strong cloud growth and a solid outlook. However, the company did acknowledge some short-term challenges, such as transactional volatility and macroeconomic headwinds.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the robust cloud performance, strong annuity growth, and favorable guidance. Despite some short-term uncertainties, the long-term strategy and execution appear to be on track.
