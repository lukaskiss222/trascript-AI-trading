The Microsoft Q3 FY2010 earnings call presents several positive indicators that are likely to have a favorable short-term impact on the company's stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Record Revenue and Profitability**: Microsoft reported record third-quarter revenue of $14.5 billion, a 6% increase year-over-year, and adjusted revenue of $14.8 billion when including the deferred revenue from the Microsoft Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Operating income and net income also saw significant increases of 17% and 36%, respectively[1].
- **Strong Product Momentum**: Windows 7 continues to drive growth, with over 10% of all PCs worldwide running the operating system, making it the fastest-selling OS in history. Other products like Bing, Xbox LIVE, and cloud services also showed strong growth[1].
- **Business PC Refresh Cycle**: The company noted a beginning of a recovery in IT hardware spending and a start to the business PC refresh cycle, which is expected to continue over the next couple of years[1].
- **Positive Outlook**: Guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 is optimistic, with expectations of continued strength in hardware shipments, growth in online advertising, and significant revenue drivers from new product launches such as Office 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2[1].

Given these strong financial results, positive product momentum, and an encouraging outlook, the likelihood is that Microsoft's stock will experience a positive impact in the short term.
