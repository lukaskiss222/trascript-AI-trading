The earnings transcript for Microsoft's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 highlights several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Cloud Performance**: Microsoft reported significant growth in its commercial cloud business, with a 147% increase in revenue and an annualized run rate exceeding $4.4 billion. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[1][4").

2. **Acquisition and Integration**: The acquisition of Nokia's Devices and Services business, although contributing to revenue, had a negative impact on earnings per share due to integration and amortization costs. However, the company is working to realize synergies and aims to reach operating break-even for the phone business by FY16[1][4].

3. **Cost Discipline and Efficiency**: Microsoft demonstrated strong cost discipline, with operating expenses growing slower than revenue. The company plans to continue this disciplined approach, aiming to reduce total operating expenses in FY15 despite investing in growth areas[1][4].

4. **Geographic Performance**: The company saw strong performance across most markets, except for China, where conditions were challenging. This mixed geographic performance might have some short-term implications but is generally positive overall[1].

5. **Product and Service Momentum**: Microsoft reported growth in various segments, including Office 365, Azure, and server products. The launch of Surface Pro 3 and the success of Xbox One also contributed positively to the quarter's results[1][4].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong cloud growth, disciplined cost management, and promising product and service momentum. However, the integration challenges with Nokia and the weak business environment in China might introduce some short-term volatility.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong cloud performance, cost discipline, and overall growth in key segments.
