Microsoft's Q3 FY15 earnings transcript indicates several positive trends and some challenges that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Trends:
- **Strong Cloud Performance**: Microsoft's commercial cloud business showed significant growth, with a $6.3 billion annualized run rate, driven by Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM. This growth is a key highlight and indicates strong adoption of Microsoft's cloud services[3][4][Transcript].
- **Consumer Cloud Growth**: Office 365 consumer subscriptions increased by 35% to over 12 million, and Bing search revenue grew 21% with a U.S. search share of 20.1%[3][4][Transcript].
- **Cost Discipline**: The company demonstrated strong operational discipline, with operating expenses growing only 1% when normalized for FX and other factors. This cost control is seen as a positive indicator of management's ability to manage expenses while investing in growth areas[3][Transcript].
- **Investor Returns**: Microsoft returned $7.5 billion to shareholders, a significant increase, which is likely to be well-received by investors[3][4][Transcript].

### Challenges:
- **Currency Headwinds**: The strong U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue growth, particularly in the Commercial segment. This is expected to continue into Q4, affecting year-over-year comparables[3][Transcript].
- **Windows and Phone Revenue**: Windows OEM Pro and non-Pro revenue declined due to post-XP refresh cycle dynamics and inventory drawdowns. Phone hardware revenue also faced challenges, including a decline in non-Lumia phones and negative FX impacts[3][Transcript].
- **Geographic Challenges**: Japan, a significant market, saw revenue declines due to macroeconomic challenges and the VAT increase, which is expected to continue in the short term[3][Transcript].

### Overall Impact:
Given the strong cloud performance, continued cost discipline, and significant returns to shareholders, these positive factors are likely to outweigh the short-term challenges such as currency headwinds and declining Windows and phone revenues. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
