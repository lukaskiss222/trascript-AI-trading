Microsoft's Q3 2011 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and strong financial performance, which are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.

Key points include:
- Record third-quarter revenue of $16.43 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, and strong earnings per share growth of 36% to $0.61[1][3][4].
- Robust performance in the Microsoft Business Division, Server & Tools, and Entertainment & Devices Division, driven by products like Office 2010, Windows Server, SQL Server, and Kinect[1][3][4].
- Continued growth in cloud services, including Office 365 and Windows Azure, which indicates a strong future outlook[1][3][4].
- Strong business PC demand and emerging market growth, despite a mixed PC environment[1][3][4].

However, there are some nuances such as the ongoing challenges in monetizing the combined Yahoo and Bing search marketplace and the impact of volume-driven costs on gross margins[1][3][4].

Given the overall strong financial results, the positive momentum in key product segments, and the promising outlook for cloud services and other divisions, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
