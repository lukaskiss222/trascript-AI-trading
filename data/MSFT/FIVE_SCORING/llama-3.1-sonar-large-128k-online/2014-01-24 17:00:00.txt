Microsoft's Q2 FY2014 earnings transcript indicates several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Signals
- Microsoft reported record revenue of $24.52 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase, exceeding analyst expectations.
- The company saw strong growth in its commercial segment, with a 10% increase in revenue, driven by double-digit growth in SQL Server, System Center, and significant expansion in cloud services like Office 365 and Azure.
- The Devices and Consumer segment had a successful holiday quarter, with Xbox One sales and Surface revenue more than doubling sequentially.
- Gross margin remained flat despite increased costs associated with new hardware launches, indicating efficient cost management.

### Mixed Signals
- While the overall PC market was slightly better than expected, consumer PC sales continued to be soft, and Windows non-Pro revenue declined 20%.
- The transition to cloud services, although positive in the long term, had a short-term negative impact on traditional licensing revenue, particularly in the consumer Office segment.
- The Surface business, despite improved sales, was still not profitable, and Xbox One launch costs were significant.

### Guidance and Outlook
- The company provided a stable outlook for the next quarter, with expectations of continued growth in both commercial and consumer segments.
- The upcoming integration of Nokia's Devices and Services business, though not yet reflected in current guidance, could bring additional opportunities and challenges.

Given these points, the short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong revenue growth, successful product launches, and continued momentum in cloud services. However, the ongoing challenges in the consumer PC market and the transition to cloud services might slightly temper the immediate positive impact.
