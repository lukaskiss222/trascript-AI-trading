Microsoft's Q4 and fiscal year 2008 earnings call presents a strong financial performance despite a challenging economic environment. Here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price outlook:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Microsoft achieved 18% revenue growth, 21% operating income growth, and 32% earnings per share growth for the fiscal year, exceeding guidance and demonstrating the breadth and resilience of its business model[1][3][4].

2. **Positive Guidance for Fiscal 2009**: The company expects revenue growth of 11% to 13%, operating income growth of 17% to 20%, and earnings per share growth of 13% to 17% for fiscal 2009. This indicates continued confidence in their financial performance despite economic uncertainties[1][3].

3. **Investments and Acquisitions**: Microsoft is increasing investments in online services, organic growth, and acquisitions, which, while beneficial long-term, may have short-term margin impacts. However, these investments are seen as strategic and necessary for future growth[1].

4. **Macro Economic Conditions**: The company is cautious about the economic environment but feels good about its position, particularly outside the U.S. and in core business segments. However, the online advertising space is expected to remain challenging[1].

5. **Margin Structure**: The core businesses are expected to maintain strong margins, while the online services business will continue to be a drag due to significant investments. The entertainment and devices division is expected to remain profitable but with flat margins[1].

Given these points, here is the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Strong Financials and Positive Guidance**: These factors are likely to support the stock price.
- **Challenging Economic Conditions and Online Advertising Space**: These could introduce some volatility but are largely factored into the guidance.
- **Investment in Online Services**: While this is a positive long-term strategy, it may not immediately translate into short-term profitability but is seen as necessary for growth.

Overall, the strong financial performance, positive guidance, and strategic investments suggest a positive but possibly muted short-term impact due to economic and online advertising challenges.
