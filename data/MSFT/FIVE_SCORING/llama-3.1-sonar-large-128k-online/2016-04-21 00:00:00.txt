Microsoft's Q3 FY2016 earnings call presents a mixed bag of results, but with several positive indicators that suggest a stable to slightly positive short-term outlook for the stock.

### Key Positives:
- **Strong Cloud Growth**: Azure revenue grew 120% in constant currency, and the commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $10 billion, halfway to the FY18 goal of $20 billion[3].
- **Office 365 Momentum**: Office 365 commercial and consumer subscriptions saw significant growth, with commercial seats up 57% and consumer subscriptions reaching 22 million[3].
- **Surface Revenue**: Surface revenue increased 61% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book[3].
- **Developer and ISV Momentum**: Microsoft is seeing increased developer engagement, particularly with Microsoft Graph APIs and the expansion of Azure services[3].

### Key Negatives:
- **Revenue Decline**: Overall revenue was $20.5 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to transactional weakness in certain segments[3].
- **Margin Pressure**: Gross margin and operating income declined due to the increasing mix of cloud services, which currently have lower margins compared to traditional software licensing[3].
- **Phone Segment Weakness**: Phone revenue declined 46% in constant currency, continuing the trend of poor performance in this segment[3].
- **Macro and Geo Weakness**: Certain geographic markets, such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, performed worse than expected, impacting overall results[3].

### Guidance and Outlook:
- Microsoft's Q4 guidance is conservative, reflecting transactional weakness and macroeconomic pressures, but the company remains optimistic about long-term cloud growth and annuity revenue[3].
- Continued investment in cloud services and data centers is expected to support future growth, despite short-term margin pressures.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a stable to slightly positive impact in the short term, driven by the strong cloud growth and the company's strategic focus on high-margin cloud services.
