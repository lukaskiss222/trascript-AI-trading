Microsoft's Q1 FY2016 earnings call presented several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock:

- **Strong Cloud Growth**: Microsoft saw significant growth in its cloud services, with Azure revenue and compute usage more than doubling year-over-year, and the commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeding $8.2 billion, up nearly 70% year-over-year[1][4][5].
- **Office 365 Momentum**: Office 365 continued to gain traction, with commercial Office 365 monthly active users growing to 60 million and consumer subscribers reaching 18.2 million. The recurring subscription revenue is now offsetting the decline in traditional license sales[1][4][5].
- **Windows 10 Adoption**: Windows 10 is seeing strong adoption, with over 110 million active devices, and positive signs in the enterprise segment, which is expected to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year[1][4][5].
- **Financial Performance**: Despite a 12% year-over-year revenue decline, largely due to the phone business and foreign exchange impacts, Microsoft's operating income and net income showed resilience. The company also increased its dividend and returned $6.9 billion to shareholders[1][4][5].
- **Positive Guidance**: The company provided a generally positive outlook, expecting continued growth in cloud services, Office 365, and a strong holiday season for Surface and other devices[4][5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong performance in cloud services, Office 365, and the promising adoption of Windows 10.
