Microsoft's earnings call highlights strong Q2 performance exceeding guidance, driven by robust PC demand, especially in emerging markets, and healthy growth in core business segments.  Management expressed satisfaction with the early consumer demand for Vista and Office 2007 and projects continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth. While some adjustments to guidance are made related to Xbox sales, the overall tone is positive and suggests a favorable short-term outlook for the stock.
