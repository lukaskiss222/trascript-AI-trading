Microsoft's earnings call highlights strong Q4 2006 results, driven by double-digit revenue growth across several business segments, particularly Home and Entertainment, Server and Tools, and Client.  Management projects continued double-digit revenue growth in FY2007, driven by Vista and Office 2007 launches.  However, increased spending on new product launches and investments in long-term growth will likely temper short-term profit margins.  This suggests a positive, but potentially slower than anticipated, near-term impact on the stock price driven by continued strong revenue growth, but lagging earnings in the first half.
