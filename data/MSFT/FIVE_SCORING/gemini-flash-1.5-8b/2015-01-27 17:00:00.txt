Microsoft's Q2 FY2015 earnings call highlights strong cloud performance, particularly in Office 365 and Azure.  Management expresses optimism about the Windows 10 platform, citing strategic investments and a focus on a mobile-first, cloud-first world.  However, the call also acknowledges headwinds from the Windows XP refresh cycle tailing off and some macroeconomic challenges in specific regions.  This suggests potential short-term stock pressure related to these factors, but impressive growth in strategic areas like the cloud could mitigate against this.
