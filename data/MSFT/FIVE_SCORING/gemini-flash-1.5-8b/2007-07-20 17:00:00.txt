Microsoft's earnings call highlights robust financial performance, exceeding expectations in several segments.  Strong demand, particularly for enterprise agreements and Windows Vista, led to increased bookings and revenue growth.  Management anticipates continued double-digit growth in fiscal 2008, fueled by new product releases and investments in key areas like online advertising and mobile devices.  This suggests a positive short-term impact on the stock price as investors likely respond favorably to the strong financial performance and optimistic outlook.
