Microsoft's Q2 2006 earnings call highlights strong product launches (Xbox 360, SQL Server 2005), healthy core software business growth, and record stock buybacks.  While some revenue figures fell slightly short of guidance, management emphasized healthy PC and server markets and impressive growth in key areas like SQL Server.  The positive tone and strong guidance for the second half of the fiscal year suggest a bullish short-term outlook for the stock.
