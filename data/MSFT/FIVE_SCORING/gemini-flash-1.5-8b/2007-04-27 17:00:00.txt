Microsoft's Q3 2007 earnings transcript reveals strong performance exceeding expectations across most segments, particularly Client and Microsoft Business Division, driven by Vista and Office System adoption.  Management is optimistic about the year's finish and is increasing guidance for revenue, operating income, and EPS due to the new product launches and healthy demand.  This suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price in the short term as investors react to the strong results and upward revisions.
