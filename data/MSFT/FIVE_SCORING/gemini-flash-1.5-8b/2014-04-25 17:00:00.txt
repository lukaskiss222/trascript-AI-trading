Microsoft's Q3 2014 earnings call highlighted strong cloud performance, particularly in Azure and Office 365.  Management emphasized a shift toward a subscription-based model and a focus on usage as a key indicator of long-term success.  While the call contained positive elements, the lack of a concrete Nokia integration plan and the transition to a more subscription-based recurring revenue model suggest that the short-term stock impact may fluctuate based on investor interpretation of these evolving strategies.
