Microsoft's Q4 2011 earnings call highlighted strong financial results, driven by robust enterprise demand and Office 365's promising start.  Management emphasized continued growth in multi-year licensing, and the company is well-positioned for long-term cloud adoption. The outlook for FY2012 includes mixed results, with Windows revenue potentially lagging PC market growth due to emerging market dynamics and the potential for slightly slower transactional revenue growth.  Positive commentary on Office 365 and continued strategic investments suggest overall positive trends.
