Microsoft's Q3 2006 earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth, driven by new product launches and robust PC/server hardware sales.  However, operating income fell short of guidance due to increased investments in MSN, marketing, and R&D, particularly for the Xbox 360 and future product launches like Windows Vista and Office 2007.  Management highlighted continued strong demand for these upcoming products including continued optimism in Xbox 360 console sales. The guidance for Q4 and FY 2007 reflects these investments, indicating potentially slower operating margin growth in the short term.
