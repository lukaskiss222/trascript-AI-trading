Based on the earnings transcript, Microsoft's quarter showed mixed signals but with several positive trends:

Key positives:
- Strong enterprise/cloud momentum with Office 365 reaching $1.5B run rate
- Record unearned revenue of $22.4B 
- Server & Tools grew 9% with strong Azure adoption
- Disciplined cost management with reduced OpEx guidance

Key concerns:
- Continued weakness in consumer PC market impacting Windows
- $900M Surface RT inventory charge
- Some margin pressure from transition to devices/services model

However, the company appears to be successfully managing its transition to cloud/devices while maintaining strong enterprise business momentum. Management's confident tone and focus on strategic initiatives suggests the stock should see modest positive movement in the near-term.
