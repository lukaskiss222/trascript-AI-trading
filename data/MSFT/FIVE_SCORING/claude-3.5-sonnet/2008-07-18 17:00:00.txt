Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, Microsoft demonstrated strong financial performance with notable strengths and some concerns:

Positives:
- Record revenue growth of 18% (fastest in almost a decade)
- Strong performance across core businesses (Client, Server & Tools, Microsoft Business Division)
- Healthy guidance for FY09 with 11-13% revenue growth projected
- Solid cash flow and balance sheet position
- Geographic diversification helping offset U.S. economic concerns

Concerns:
- Online Services Division continues to require significant investment and faces competitive challenges
- Some margin pressure due to increased spending
- Economic uncertainty affecting online advertising revenue
- Lower growth expected in Entertainment & Devices division due to tough Halo 3 comparisons

The company's core businesses remain very healthy while management is making strategic investments for long-term growth. Despite some near-term spending pressure, the overall financial outlook and execution remains strong, which should positively impact the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
