Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with accelerating revenue growth reaching 16% in Q4 (highest Q4 growth in 7 years) and double-digit growth across most business segments. Unearned revenue grew 19% to a record $10.9B.

2. Aggressive shareholder return program announced with a $20B tender offer and additional $20B buyback authorization, signaling management's confidence and providing significant near-term buying support for the stock.

3. Positive guidance for FY07 with 12-14% revenue growth expected and strong momentum heading into major product launches (Vista, Office 2007). While there are increased investments planned, the overall financial outlook remains robust.

The combination of strong current execution, major upcoming catalysts with Vista/Office, and significant buyback support should drive positive stock performance over the next 1-2 weeks.
