Based on the detailed earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with revenue and earnings exceeding guidance across all business segments, with particularly robust growth in core businesses (Windows, Office, Server & Tools).

2. Management raised full-year guidance and demonstrated confidence in the upcoming launches of Vista and Office 2007, while maintaining disciplined cost control.

3. Key metrics like unearned revenue, renewal rates, and premium mix were all trending positively, suggesting strong business momentum heading into major product launches.

The only minor concerns were around Xbox unit guidance reduction and online services growth, but these are relatively small parts of Microsoft's overall business. The core enterprise and Windows/Office businesses that drive profits showed excellent performance and outlook.
