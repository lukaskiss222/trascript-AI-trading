Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, Microsoft demonstrated strong performance across multiple business segments. Key positives include:

1. Solid revenue growth (7% YoY) with strength across all divisions
2. Strong enterprise demand and healthy business PC growth
3. Office 365 exceeding expectations with strong early adoption
4. Strategic moves with Skype acquisition and expanded partnerships
5. Robust guidance for key divisions and maintained profitability

The managements' tone was confident and they effectively addressed concerns while highlighting growth opportunities. The only minor concerns were some monetization challenges in online services and slightly muted consumer PC growth.

Given the broad-based strength, positive guidance, and strategic positioning, this earnings call should drive positive short-term stock price movement.
