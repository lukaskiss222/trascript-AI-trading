Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positive factors include:

1. Strong Q1 results with better-than-expected consumer demand for Windows and Xbox products
2. Successful Windows 7 launch with positive early indicators and channel inventory rebuilding
3. Excellent cost control with operating expenses down 10% and lowered full-year guidance
4. Strong cash flow of $6.1B and resumption of share buybacks

While there are some concerns around weak business spending, the overall tone was confident regarding Microsoft's product cycle and positioning for economic recovery. Management's detailed guidance and transparency also helps reduce uncertainty.
