Based on the earnings call transcript, Microsoft delivered strong performance across multiple segments, particularly in commercial/enterprise business. Key positives include:

1. Strong commercial revenue growth of 10% with healthy renewal rates
2. Cloud services revenue grew over 100% with Office 365 and Azure seeing triple-digit seat growth
3. Better than expected Windows OEM performance (-7% vs expected mid-teens decline)
4. Improved Surface sales execution with doubled unit sales
5. Positive guidance for holiday season with new product launches (Xbox One, Surface 2)

However, there are some offsetting factors:

1. Margin pressure expected in Q2 due to Xbox One and Surface launches
2. Ongoing transition costs as business model shifts to cloud/subscription
3. Continued weakness in China market
4. Consumer PC market remains volatile

Given the strong commercial momentum, cloud growth acceleration, and positive holiday outlook that should offset near-term margin pressures, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction in the next 1-2 weeks.
