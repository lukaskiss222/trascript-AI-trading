Based on my analysis of Microsoft's Q2 FY09 earnings call, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's why:

1. Significant cost-cutting measures announced, including up to 5,000 layoffs and reduced capital expenditure, indicating serious concerns about the business environment.

2. No specific revenue or EPS guidance provided for the rest of FY09 due to economic uncertainty, which typically makes markets nervous.

3. Management explicitly stated they expect business conditions to "reset" to a lower level rather than quickly rebound, suggesting prolonged weakness.

4. Key revenue drivers showed weakness:
- Client (Windows) revenue declined 8%
- Traditional PC market declined ~10%
- Consumer business showing significant weakness
- Enterprise spending expected to remain under pressure

While there were some positive elements (like Xbox sales and cost control measures), the overall tone was cautious and indicated significant near-term challenges ahead.
