Based on the earnings transcript, Microsoft showed strong performance across core businesses with several positive indicators:

Key Positives:
- Strong core business growth (Client, Server & Tools, Information Worker)
- Successful product launches (SQL Server 2005, Xbox 360)
- Double-digit revenue growth guidance
- Strong unearned revenue and contract backlog
- Healthy IT spending environment

Some Concerns:
- Xbox 360 supply constraints impacting sales targets
- MSN revenue slightly down due to Ad Center transition
- Some pressure on margins due to investments

The overall tone is quite positive, with management expressing confidence in their product roadmap and market position. The guidance suggests continued strong growth. While there are some near-term challenges in gaming and online advertising, these appear temporary rather than structural issues.

Given the strong core business performance, positive guidance, and management's confident tone, I expect this earnings report to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
