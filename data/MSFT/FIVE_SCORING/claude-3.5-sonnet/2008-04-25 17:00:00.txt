Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong financial performance with revenue growth of 14% and EPS growth of 27%, beating analyst expectations, demonstrating resilience despite economic uncertainty.

2. Robust and diversified business model with growth across multiple segments, particularly in enterprise and entertainment divisions, providing stability and multiple growth drivers.

3. Positive forward guidance for both Q4 and preliminary FY2009, suggesting continued momentum and management confidence in the business outlook.

While there are some potential headwinds around PC growth moderation and Yahoo acquisition uncertainty, the overall strong execution and positive outlook should drive positive sentiment.
