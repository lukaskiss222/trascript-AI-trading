Based on this earnings call transcript, I am very positive about Microsoft's short-term stock outlook. Here are the key reasons:

1. Strong cloud momentum with Office 365 and Azure showing excellent growth (O365 at $2.5B run rate, Azure growing >150%)

2. Solid Windows performance in enterprise/business segments with Windows Pro revenue up 19%

3. New CEO Satya Nadella demonstrated clear strategic vision around mobile-first/cloud-first transformation while maintaining execution

4. Healthy financial metrics with revenue up 8% and disciplined cost management

5. Positive commentary around Office 365 adoption, renewal rates, and expansion into new platforms like iPad

The leadership transition appears smooth, core businesses are performing well, and the cloud transition is gaining significant traction. Management's tone was confident and forward-looking.
