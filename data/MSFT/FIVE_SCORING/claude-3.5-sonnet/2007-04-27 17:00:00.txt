Based on the extensive earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of Microsoft's likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Strong Q3 results exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income, and EPS
- Healthy Premium mix adoption for Vista (71%, up 18 points YoY)
- Office/MBD division showing 20% organic growth
- Raised full year guidance
- Strong cash flow and continued share repurchases

Minor Concerns:
- Some shift in expenses to Q4
- Entertainment division still working towards profitability
- Relatively conservative FY08 margin outlook

The overall tone is very positive with management demonstrating strong execution across core businesses and raising guidance. The results and outlook should drive positive sentiment in the near-term, particularly given the beat-and-raise quarter.

Given the comprehensive strength shown and management's confident tone, I expect a positive stock reaction over the next 1-2 weeks.
