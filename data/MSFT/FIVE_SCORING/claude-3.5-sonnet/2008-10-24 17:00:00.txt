Based on the earnings transcript, I assess the short-term (1-2 week) stock impact as moderately positive. Here's my reasoning:

1. Despite acknowledging macroeconomic challenges, Microsoft delivered strong Q1 results that met or exceeded guidance across revenue, operating income, and EPS.

2. Key positives:
- Server & Tools and Microsoft Business Division grew combined revenue by $1.3B (19%)
- Company maintained healthy cash flow and $25B cash position
- Implemented cost control measures saving $400-500M in operating expenses
- Strong position in emerging segments like netbooks

3. While guidance was adjusted lower due to economic uncertainty, the company still projects 7-10% revenue growth and potential double-digit EPS growth, which is impressive given the environment.

The combination of solid execution, strong cash position, and proactive cost management in a challenging environment should provide near-term support for the stock.
