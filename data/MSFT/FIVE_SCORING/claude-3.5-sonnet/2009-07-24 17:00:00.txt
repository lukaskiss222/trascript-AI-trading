Based on the detailed earnings call transcript, here's my analysis for Microsoft's near-term stock outlook:

Positive factors:
- Strong cost control measures implemented ($3B in expense reductions)
- Major product launches coming (Windows 7, Office 2010)
- Stabilizing PC market with sequential growth
- Strong balance sheet with $30B+ cash position

Negative factors:
- Revenue declined 17% YoY due to weak global demand
- Margins compressed due to lower business PC sales/premium mix
- Management expects continued economic weakness through end of 2009
- Deferred revenue from Windows 7 will impact near-term results

Overall assessment: While Microsoft has executed well on cost controls and product delivery, near-term headwinds from the economy and product transition period will likely weigh on the stock over the next 1-2 weeks. Management's cautious outlook and expectations for continued weakness suggest limited upside catalysts in the immediate term.
