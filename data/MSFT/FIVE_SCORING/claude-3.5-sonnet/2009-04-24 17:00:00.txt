Based on the earnings call transcript, I predict a mildly negative short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

Positive factors:
- Strong cost control with operating expenses reduced by $1B more than previously guided
- Healthy annuity business and enterprise renewals
- Strong cash flow generation (~$20B annualized)
- Upcoming product cycle with Windows 7, Office 2010, etc.

Negative factors:
- Continued weakness in global demand and macro environment expected through 2009
- Declining margins due to higher COGS and shift to lower-priced products
- No stock buybacks in Q3 reflecting cautious capital management
- Weakness in emerging markets and transactional business
- Management explicitly cautious on near-term outlook

While there are some bright spots around cost control and future product launches, management's cautious commentary about continued weakness through 2009 and margin pressure will likely weigh on the stock in the very near term.
