Based on the earnings transcript, Microsoft demonstrated exceptional performance across multiple business segments. Key positives include:

1. Revenue growth of 27% YoY - fastest Q1 growth in 7 years
2. Strong performance in core segments (Client, Server & Tools, Business Division)
3. Healthy PC market growth of 14-16%
4. Robust Vista adoption with premium SKUs exceeding expectations
5. Raised full-year guidance across revenue, operating income and EPS
6. Strong international growth, particularly in emerging markets
7. Solid operating margin expansion
8. Successful integration of aQuantive acquisition

The management's confident tone, raised guidance, and broad-based strength across segments suggest this strong momentum will continue in the near term. The only minor concern is some margin pressure expected in coming quarters, but this appears to be mainly due to planned investments and product mix.

Given the outstanding results, raised outlook, and positive management commentary, I expect the stock to see a meaningful rally in the next 1-2 weeks.
