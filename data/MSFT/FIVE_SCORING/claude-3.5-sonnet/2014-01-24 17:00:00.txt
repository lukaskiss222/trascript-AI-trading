Based on Microsoft's Q2 FY2014 earnings call, I assess a positive short-term impact on the stock price. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong performance across multiple segments with devices and consumer revenue up 13% and commercial revenue up 10%, demonstrating successful execution of Microsoft's strategic initiatives.

2. Solid Xbox One launch with 3.9 million units sold and Surface sales more than doubling sequentially, showing momentum in hardware.

3. Robust cloud services growth with Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM all growing over 100%, indicating successful transition to cloud-based services.

The management team demonstrated confident execution of their strategy while maintaining cost discipline. The diversified revenue streams and strong commercial performance should provide positive momentum for the stock in the near term.
