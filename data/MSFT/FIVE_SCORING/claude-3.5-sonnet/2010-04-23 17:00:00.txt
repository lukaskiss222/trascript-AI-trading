Based on the earnings call transcript, Microsoft demonstrated strong performance with several positive indicators:

1. Record Q3 revenues and operating cash flow
2. Strong Windows 7 adoption with 10% PC penetration in 6 months
3. Signs of business PC refresh cycle beginning
4. Beat expectations on earnings with 36% EPS growth
5. Strong product pipeline including Office 2010, Azure, and new mobile offerings
6. Effective cost management leading to margin expansion

The management's tone was confident and they provided optimistic guidance for continued growth through the business PC refresh cycle and new product launches. They are also seeing early signs of recovery in IT hardware spending.

Given these factors, particularly the strong execution, healthy guidance, and multiple growth catalysts ahead, I expect a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
