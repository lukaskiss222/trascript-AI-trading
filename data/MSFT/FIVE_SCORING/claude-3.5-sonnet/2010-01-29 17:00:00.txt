Based on this Q2 FY2010 earnings call, Microsoft demonstrated strong performance driven by Windows 7's successful launch and robust consumer demand. Key positives include:

1. Record revenue and profits with Windows 7 becoming fastest-selling OS
2. Strong consumer segment performance with 60+ million Windows 7 licenses sold
3. Healthy cash flow and continued shareholder returns through dividends/buybacks
4. Conservative cost management while maintaining strategic investments
5. Promising product pipeline with Office 2010, Azure, and Natal upcoming

While enterprise spending remained soft, the overall tone was optimistic regarding gradual business recovery and Microsoft's positioning to capitalize on it. The strong Windows 7 momentum and disciplined operational execution suggest positive short-term stock performance.
