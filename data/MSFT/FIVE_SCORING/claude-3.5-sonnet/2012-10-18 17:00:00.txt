Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a neutral to slightly positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price. While there are some concerns around PC market weakness and Windows 8 adoption, several positive factors emerged: strong enterprise business momentum (especially in Server & Tools with 20%+ bookings growth), healthy multi-year licensing growth across divisions, and encouraging Windows 8 pre-sales data (40% higher than Windows 7). The management's tone was confident regarding the Windows 8/Surface launch and strategic positioning, though tempered with realistic expectations about the transition period.
