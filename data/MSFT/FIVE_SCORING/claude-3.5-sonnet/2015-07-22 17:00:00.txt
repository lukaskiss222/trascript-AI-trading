Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Microsoft's stock price for the following reasons:

1. Strong cloud performance with 88% growth and an $8B run rate, showing successful execution of their strategic transformation
2. Solid performance across key growth areas including Surface (doubled revenue), Xbox, and Office 365 (continued strong subscription growth)
3. Disciplined cost management with lower OpEx guidance while still investing in growth initiatives
4. Management provided clear visibility into Windows 10 launch phases and expressed confidence in second half acceleration

While there are some headwinds from FX and the phone restructuring, the overall tone was confident and the company demonstrated strong execution across their core growth initiatives.
