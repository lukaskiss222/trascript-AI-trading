However, Gedung's poniewa≈º guidance for FY08 contributes to cautious optimism, highlighting a balanced outlook with modest revenue and profit growth. Short-term performance will be influenced by the sustaining momentum of Vista and Office, while the long-term trajectory hinges on the development of their Online Services division. Management's emphasis on investment persistency in this division indicates their commitment, despite ongoing challenges. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a moderate boost in the short term.
