Microsoft's Q1 results showed resilience in the face of a challenging economic environment, with strong consumer demand and successful cost-cutting measures. The launch of Windows 7 and its positive consumer response are encouraging, along with gains in the search engine Bing. However, subdued business spending and uncertain PC market dynamics impact short-term growth. The stock is likely to experience a modest negative impact in the next 1â€“2 weeks due to a cautious outlook on enterprise IT spending and a general lack of significant positives to drive the price up.
