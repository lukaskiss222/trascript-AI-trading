Microsoft's Q4 earnings call reveals a strong finish to FY2006, with accelerated revenue growth driven by successful product launches. The FY2007 outlook is positive, projecting continued double-digit revenue and EPS expansion. However, increased operating expenses and investments in various business areas, along with the impending launch costs of Windows Vista and Office 2007, are likely to impact short-term profitability. The stock may face some pressure due to these increased expenses, but the overall long-term growth strategy is encouraging. The introduction of a substantial share repurchase program offers some support to the stock price.
