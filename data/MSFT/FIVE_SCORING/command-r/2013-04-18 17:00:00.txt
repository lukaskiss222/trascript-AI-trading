Microsoft's Q3 earnings call reveals a diverse performance across its segments. While Windows faces challenges due to the evolving PC market, Office 365's strong adoption and a wholesome increase in server and tools revenue are positives. The focus on cloud services and the upcoming launch of Windows Blue seem to be strategic steps. However, the impact of shifting to subscription-based models and the uncertain PC market could cause short-term challenges. Overall, investors may need more convincing about the company's immediate direction, especially with the PC market's decline.
