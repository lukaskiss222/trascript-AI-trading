Microsoft's short-term prospects appear stable, with continued double-digit revenue growth projected. However, the entertainment and devices division's performance may be a concern, as it faces tough comparisons to the successful Xbox 360 launches of the previous year. Additionally, significant investments in the online services division to counterbalance Microsoft's position in the online advertising market could impact short-term profitability. The stock is likely to react neutrally to these projections in the short run.
