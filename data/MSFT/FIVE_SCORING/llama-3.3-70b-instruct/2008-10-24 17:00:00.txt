Microsoft's Q1 FY09 earnings call revealed a mixed picture, with the company delivering strong financial results despite a challenging economic environment. The guidance for Q2 and FY09 was tempered, reflecting increased uncertainty and a potential recession. However, management expressed confidence in Microsoft's relative competitive position and ability to outgrow the overall IT market. The company's strong cash flow, high unearned revenue, and $25 billion in cash and investments will help weather any economic contraction.

Microsoft's focus on cost-cutting measures, including a $400-500 million decrease in operating expenses, and strategic investments in key areas will help maintain profitability. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and economic uncertainty, but the company's long-term outlook remains strong.
