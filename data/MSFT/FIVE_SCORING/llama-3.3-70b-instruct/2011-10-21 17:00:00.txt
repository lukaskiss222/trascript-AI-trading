Microsoft's Q1 FY12 earnings call revealed a strong start to the year, with revenue growth across all segments and a 10% increase in earnings per share. The company's cloud-based offerings, such as Office 365, are gaining traction, and the acquisition of Skype is expected to drive growth in real-time communications. However, the company faces challenges in the Online Services Division, particularly in monetizing its search platform. Given the overall positive tone and strong financial performance, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
