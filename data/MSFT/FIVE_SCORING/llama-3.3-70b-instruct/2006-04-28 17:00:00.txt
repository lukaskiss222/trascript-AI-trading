Microsoft's Q3 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by new product momentum and healthy PC and server hardware shipments. The company's operating income was lower than expected due to higher product costs and investments in marketing and R&D. Guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2007 was provided, with expected revenue growth of 13-15% and 12-14%, respectively. However, operating income growth is expected to be lower due to continued investments in the business. The company's strategy to invest aggressively in new products and services, such as Xbox 360, Windows Vista, and online services, may lead to short-term margin compression, but is expected to drive long-term growth. Given the strong revenue growth and investments in the business, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
