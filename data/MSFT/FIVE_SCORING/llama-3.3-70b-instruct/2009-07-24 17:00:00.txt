Microsoft's Q4 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with revenue declining 17% year-over-year due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. However, the company executed well, cutting costs and delivering a strong wave of products. Management expects economic conditions to remain difficult for the balance of the calendar year but sees potential for improvement in 2010. With a strong product pipeline, including the upcoming launch of Windows 7, and a focus on expense control, Microsoft is well-positioned for the long term. Despite short-term headwinds, the company's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning capital to shareholders are positives.
