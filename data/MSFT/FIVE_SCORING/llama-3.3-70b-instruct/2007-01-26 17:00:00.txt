Microsoft's Q2 earnings call revealed strong results across the board, with revenue, operating income, and EPS exceeding the high end of guidance. The company's core businesses, including client, server and tools, and Microsoft Business Division, grew double-digits, driven by healthy demand for Windows Vista, Office 2007, and SQL Server. The launch of Windows Vista and Office 2007 is expected to drive revenue growth in the second half of the year, although the company is taking a conservative view of the impact. The Xbox business is expected to decline in the second half due to inventory management and a cautious view of the market.
