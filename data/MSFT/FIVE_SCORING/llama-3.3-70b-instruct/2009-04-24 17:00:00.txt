Microsoft's third-quarter earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with revenue declining 6% to $13.6 billion due to a weak macroeconomic environment, but earnings per share meeting expectations at $0.39. The company's annuity business remained a bright spot, with strong sales execution and corporate customers renewing their long-term commitments. Management expects the spending environment to remain difficult in the fourth quarter and potentially through the balance of the calendar year, but is focused on delivering a wave of new products over the next 12-18 months, which should help drive growth in fiscal year 2010 and beyond. Given the company's strong cash generation and commitment to returning capital to shareholders, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
