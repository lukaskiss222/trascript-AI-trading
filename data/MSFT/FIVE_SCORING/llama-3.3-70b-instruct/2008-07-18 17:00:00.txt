Microsoft's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong financial performance, with revenue growth of 18% and operating income growth of 42%. The company's guidance for fiscal year 2009 also looks promising, with expected revenue growth of 11% to 13% and operating income growth of 17% to 20%. However, the online services business is expected to remain a drag on profitability due to significant investments in search and ad platforms. Despite this, management's tone was positive, and they expressed confidence in the company's ability to drive long-term earnings per share growth. Overall, the stock is likely to receive a positive boost from the earnings call, driven by the company's strong financial performance and promising guidance.
