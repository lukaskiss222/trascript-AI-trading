Microsoft's Q3 earnings call revealed strong demand for Windows 7, a return to business PC growth, and a solid product pipeline. The company's guidance for Q4 and FY11 suggests continued revenue growth, driven by the launch of Office 2010, SharePoint 2010, and SQL Server 2008 R2. While there are some concerns about lengthening sales cycles and unearned revenue, the overall tone of the call was positive, with a focus on executing well and managing costs. The stock is likely to react positively to the earnings call, driven by the strong product momentum and improving market conditions.
