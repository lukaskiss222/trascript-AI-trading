Microsoft's fiscal Q4 earnings call revealed solid financial results, with revenue growth and operating margin expansion. The company's enterprise products and services remain a top priority for CIOs, with strong demand for Windows 7, Office 2010, and Server & Tools products. While the PC market is expected to be soft, Microsoft expects Windows 8 to drive the PC ecosystem forward, and the company is well-positioned to capitalize on trends in cloud computing, mobility, and big data. However, the guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2013 is somewhat conservative, with Windows revenue expected to lag the PC market in the first quarter and be roughly in line for the full year.
