Microsoft's Q2 earnings call revealed outstanding results, with revenue exceeding expectations by $300 million and growing 30% year-over-year. The company saw strength across all customer segments, divisions, channels, and geographies, driven by demand for Windows Vista, Office 2007, and a strong holiday season for Xbox. Management raised guidance for the year, expecting revenue growth of 17-18% and operating income growth of 31-32%. The stock is likely to react positively to the strong earnings beat and raised guidance, driven by the company's diversified product portfolio and global presence.
