Microsoft's Q3 earnings call revealed strong financial performance, with revenue, operating income, and earnings per share exceeding expectations. The company's core products, such as Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office System, drove double-digit growth, and the field sales force saw broad strength across all customer segments and regions. Management raised its revenue, operating income, and earnings per share guidance for the full year, citing the successful product launches and a strong finish to the fiscal year. Given the positive outlook and strong Q3 results, I expect the stock to experience a positive impact in the short term.
