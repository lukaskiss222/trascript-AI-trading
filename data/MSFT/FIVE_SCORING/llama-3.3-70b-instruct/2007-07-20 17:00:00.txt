Microsoft's strong Q4 performance, with revenue growing 13% and core bookings increasing over 20%, sets a positive tone for fiscal 2008. The company's guidance for 11% to 13% revenue growth and operating income growth of 20% to 22% suggests continued momentum. Management's focus on product launches, including Windows Vista, Office 2007, and upcoming server products, supports long-term growth potential.
