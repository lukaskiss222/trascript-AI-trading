Microsoft's Q4 earnings transcript reveals a mixed bag of results, with the company's Windows division experiencing a decline in revenue due to the evolving device market, while the enterprise business continues to show strength. The company's shift to a device and services strategy, including the launch of Surface and Windows 8, has resulted in increased investments in marketing and research and development, impacting margins. However, the company's cloud offerings, such as Office 365 and Windows Azure, are gaining traction, with Office 365 reaching a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate. Given the company's ongoing transition and investments in new technologies, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key product launches.
