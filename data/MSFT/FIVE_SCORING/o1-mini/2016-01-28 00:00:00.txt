Microsoft reported mixed second-quarter results with overall revenue slightly declining by 2%, but demonstrated strong growth in key areas like Azure and Office 365. Management remains optimistic about cloud expansion despite currency headwinds and lowered full-year guidance, which may balance investor sentiment. The stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term.
