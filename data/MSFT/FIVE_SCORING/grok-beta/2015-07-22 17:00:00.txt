The Q4 fiscal year 2015 earnings call for Microsoft shows a robust quarter, particularly with continued strong growth in cloud services (up by 88%), very positive uptake of Office 365, and significant momentum with Azure and first-party hardware like Surface and Xbox. However, given the lowered guidance for the phone business alongside currency headwinds, a slight short-term negative impact on stock price is anticipated. Still, the overall reception of the earnings could offset some of the negatives due to the strong results in other streamlines, positioning the company for future growth.
