Microsoft reported a record $20.9 billion in revenue, a 5% increase from last year, with strong enterprise demand and growth in key segments like Office, Server & Tools, and Xbox. Despite initial challenges, positive developments include Windows 8 anticipation, Office 365 growth, and Skype integration.
