The Q1 earnings call for Microsoft showed mixed signals. While the company demonstrated strong cost control and consumer demand for Windows 7 and Xbox, the business spending remained weak, and the launch of Windows 7 did not directly reflect in the revenue due to deferred recognition of upgrade program sales. The operating expenses were significantly reduced, which should positively impact the stock in the short term due to improved profitability. However, the lack of quick rebound in enterprise spending and the conservative outlook for the rest of the year still introduce uncertainty. Given this, the stock might experience a slight positive effect in the short term due to the underlying business improvement and anticipation of a potential business PC refresh cycle.
