Microsoft delivered a year of robust financial performance, with revenue growth of 18%, operating income up 21%, and EPS up 32%, showcasing its resilience amidst economic challenges. While the fiscal 2009 guidance slightly lowered revenue expectations and indicated increased investments—particularly in inorganic acquisitions and online services—this is balanced by strong growth projections in key sectors like server and tools, and MBD. The commitment to share repurchases ($12 billion in FY08) also signals strong financial health. However, the stock’s underperformance, likely due to market conditions and the failed Yahoo! acquisition, could dampen short-term investor confidence. Given Microsoft’s strong fundamentals, increasing investments for future market expansion, and clear strategy for growth, a cautious optimism seems appropriate for the short term.
