Microsoft's earnings call indicates a mixed outlook for the short term. While the company is making significant advancements in productivity, infrastructure, and introducing new form factors with Windows 8 and Surface, challenges in PC sales, the decline in transactional revenue, and particular headwinds in Europe suggest potential near-term stock pressure. However, positive aspects like strong enterprise multiyear licensing growth and strategic investments for long-term growth provide a counterbalance. The stock might experience some volatility over the 1â€“2 weeks post-earnings due to these mixed signals.
