Microsoft's Q4 earnings showcased strong fiscal performance with revenue growth, significant share buybacks, and a promising product lineup for fiscal 2008, which should give investors confidence in continued growth. However, the guidance for FY2008 slightly missed expectations due to a cautious approach in some business segments and challenges in online revenue recognition. The market might react positively in the short-term due to the robust financials and a substantial share buyback plan, but concerns about the online services business and conservative enterprise software rollout plans could temper gains.
