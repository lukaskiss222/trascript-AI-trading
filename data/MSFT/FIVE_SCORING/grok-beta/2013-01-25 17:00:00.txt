Microsoft's fiscal year 2013 Q2 earnings call highlights several positive and negative factors influencing potential stock movement. The record revenue of $22 billion and earnings per share of $0.81, alongside strong bookings growth and high Windows 8 sales, suggest optimism. However, the ongoing transition in the Windows ecosystem and the pressure on PC sales due to market dynamics and competition from tablets might temper short-term expectations. The stock could see a mild positive reaction due to better-than-expected operational performance and promising enterprise business growth.
