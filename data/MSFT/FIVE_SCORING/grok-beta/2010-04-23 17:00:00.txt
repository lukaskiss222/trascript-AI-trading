Microsoftâ€™s Q3 results exceeded expectations with positive signals on several fronts. The company reported strong Windows 7 demand, which significantly boosted revenue and profit growth, along with the commercial availability of new products like Azure, Office 2010, and Windows Phone 7, suggesting a positive short-term outlook. However, the tempered enthusiasm for enterprise spending and potential delays in capital project investment may slightly offset the positive momentum. While the stock might see a slight positive movement due to the good results, the sustainability of these gains depends on the broader IT spending trends.
