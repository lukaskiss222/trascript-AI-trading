Microsoft's third-quarter earnings call presents several positive indicators for its stock over the next 1â€“2 weeks. The company reported robust financial performance across multiple segments, exceeding expectations on enterprise products, notably in Windows 7 upgrades and server & tools revenue. These results, combined with forward-looking guidance suggesting low double-digit growth in key divisions for Q4 and fiscal 2013, should support a positive stock movement. Additionally, the emphasis on transforming XP users to Windows 8 and the anticipation of upcoming major product releases should further boost investor confidence.
