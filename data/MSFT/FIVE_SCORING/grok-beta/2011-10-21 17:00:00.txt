Microsoft started the fiscal year with strong momentum, evidenced by revenue growth across all segments. Despite challenges in search monetization with Bing, the success of Office 365 and Skype acquisition suggests a potentially positive short-term mood around the stock. Furthermore, the integration of Skype opens avenues for enhanced user engagement and revenue models. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks due to the bullish outlook from management and the strategic direction outlined for future growth.
