**Analysis:** Microsoft Corp.'s earnings call for Q1 2007 indicates a robust start to the fiscal year, with revenues, operating income, and EPS all surpassing guidance. The company reported strong performances across different segments, especially in the Server and Tools division due to SQL Server demand and in the Entertainment and Devices division with Xbox 360 hardware. Anticipated product launches like Windows Vista and Office 2007 were expected to fuel further growth, particularly in the latter half of the year. However, the deferral of revenue recognition due to technology guarantee programs may cause some short-term volatility in stock price, although the full-year outlook remains positive.

**Conclusion:** Given the promising product cycle, solid guidance, strong revenue from recent product launches, and the company's optimistic outlook on upcoming products, there's a likelihood of an upward movement in Microsoft's stock, especially with the holiday season potentially driving hardware sales.
